2017-02-01,Government to set out Brexit plan,https://web.archive.org//web/20170202115814/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38836906,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe government's Brexit strategy will come under scrutiny when an official policy document setting out its plans is published later.The White Paper, which was promised after pressure from MPs, comes after the Commons voted to allow the PM to begin the Brexit process.MPs backed the European Union Bill by 498 votes to 114 on Wednesday night, with 47 Labour rebels voting against. The bill will now face more debate before it can become law.MPs will discuss the bill in more detail next week when it reaches the committee stage in the Commons, and Labour has vowed to force through amendments.Hundreds of amendments have already been tabled for debate between Monday and Wednesday, with objectives set out in the government's strategy expected to attract more.Shadow cabinet members Rachael Maskell and Dawn Butler quit the party's front bench shortly before Wednesday evening's vote, and in total, 13 Labour frontbenchers voted against their own party position which was to support the bill.Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, shadow chancellor John McDonnell said other parties had also been divided on the issue, with two of the Liberal Democrats' nine MPs abstaining despite orders to oppose the bill.Mr McDonnell said a decision on whether frontbench rebels could remain in their jobs would be taken ""in due course"", and that the atmosphere in his party was ""one of mutual respect"", with determination to oppose a ""reckless Brexit"".He said Labour ""may look divided"" but would unite after the government triggers official negotiations under Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty while ""the Tory Party will split apart"".Sorry, your browser cannot display this content.Enter your postcode, or the name or constituency of your MPThe Brexit bill was published last week, after the Supreme Court decided MPs and peers must have a say before Article 50 could be triggered.It rejected the government's argument that Mrs May had sufficient powers to trigger Brexit without consulting Parliament.Iain Watson, BBC political correspondent, said a ""sizeable"" Labour rebellion could grow further if amendments were not passed.By Iain Watson, BBC political correspondentIn truth, the substance of the government's white paper will be similar to the speech the prime minister gave last month, setting out her priorities for the forthcoming negotiations with the EU.Only one Conservative MP - the former Chancellor Ken Clarke - voted against the principle of leaving the EU last night but some of his colleagues are more likely to defy their government on the detail.Labour, however, appears more divided. Three shadow cabinet members refused to support triggering Article 50 and stepped down before the vote. Jeremy Corbyn is yet to decide whether to discipline the 10 junior shadow ministers who rebelled, or indeed the three whips who were supposed to impose party discipline rather than flout it.With the possibility of two more shadow cabinet members going next week, Mr Corbyn will have to decide whether to relax his instruction not to block Brexit if Labour's amendments are defeated.The SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Liberal Democrats all opposed the government's bill, alongside Tory Ken Clarke.The SNP's foreign affairs spokesman at Westminster, Alex Salmond, said there would be ""detailed questions"" about the bill during its next stage.He said ""the calibre of the government will be judged by how they respond to the amendments"".Mr Clarke, the only Conservative MP to defy his party by voting against the bill, said the result was ""historic"", but the ""mood could change"" when the ""real action"" of negotiations with the EU starts.Mrs May has set a deadline of 31 March for invoking Article 50. Talks with the EU are expected to last up to two years, with the UK predicted to leave the 28-member organisation in 2019."

2017-02-01,Heathrow 'to get more domestic links',https://web.archive.org//web/20170202115814/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-38837704,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkBuilding a third runway at Heathrow will allow more connecting flights with other UK airports, Transport Secretary Chris Grayling has said.He told the Commons that six regional airports could be added to the Heathrow hub network, bringing the total to 14.The new airports are thought to be Belfast, Liverpool, Newquay, Prestwick Humberside, and Durham Tees Valley.His comments came as he launched a public consultation on a new runway, unlikely to be operational until 2025. Last October, after years of delay, the government said that building a third runway at Heathrow was its preferred option for expanding airport capacity.Mr Grayling told the Commons that a third runway would generate tens of thousands of jobs, and be a major boost to the economy as Britain prepares to leave the European Union.  ""By backing the north-west runway at Heathrow airport and publishing our proposals, we are sending a clear signal that when we leave the EU, we are open for business,"" Mr Grayling said.With the government about to set out its strategy for withdrawal from the EU in a White Paper, Mr Grayling said that a third runway at Heathrow would enhance the UK's global links.""Leaving the EU is a new chapter for Britain and provides us with a great opportunity to forge a new role in the world. We are determined to seize that opportunity and having the right infrastructure in place will allow us to build a more global Britain,"" he told MPs.Alongside his announcement of a ""draft policy statement"" on Heathrow expansion, Mr Grayling also issued a consultation document on improving Britain's air space infrastructure and investing in new technology.He said it made sense to carry out the two consultations together, which will run until 25 May, with the final decisions going before Parliament late this year or early 2018.The consultations on Heathrow and air traffic facilities will involve events across the country ""because the whole country will benefit,"" Mr Grayling said. He is due in Glasgow later to expand on how travellers and freight users outside the south east England will benefit.The cost of a third runway is estimated to be £22bn, and is forecast to generate about 70,000 jobs. An additional 260,000 take-offs or landings would be permitted each year from the expanded airport, on top of the current cap of 480,000.The consultation will consider such things as pollution, additional rail and road infrastructure such a roads, and the impact on surrounding towns and villages. But there is expected to be continued significant opposition to the third runway proposal.Earlier, Liberal Democrat MP for Richmond Park and North Kingston, Sarah Olney, accused the government of being ""so desperate"" to reassure businesses about its Brexit plans that it is ""willing to steamroller over those communities opposed to Heathrow expansion"".And John Stewart, chairman of anti-Heathrow expansion group Hacan, said it was important that the government assessed the consultation ""in an even-handed way"" and rejected the plan if the expected impact on issues such as noise was found to be ""too great""."

It came after the UK defence secretary told BBC Scotland that the SNP should ""forget"" about holding a second referendum. But Sir Michael Fallon would not be drawn on reports he had suggested the UK government would block a vote.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon tweeted that Sir Michael had ""seriously backpedalled"" on the issue. A spokeswoman for Prime Minister Theresa May later said that the referendum in 2014, when Scotland voted by 55% to 45% to remain in the UK, was ""legal, fair and decisive"".She added: ""We believe that this issue was settled in 2014. Recent polls don't suggest that there has been a big change in the views around a second referendum.""The Scottish first minister has said another independence referendum was increasingly likely in the wake of the Brexit vote, but she would need the UK government's permission in order to hold a second legally binding vote.Speaking to BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme, Sir Michael said the SNP ""need to forget all that stuff and get on with what they were elected to do.""But he did not directly answer questions on whether or not the UK government would allow a vote. He said: ""We don't see the need for a referendum - this is a diversion. ""What the Scottish government should be focusing on is what it was elected to do, which is to improve schools standards, get to grips with the problems in Scottish hospitals and reverse the serious rise in unemployment.""The minister urged the SNP to focus on their ""day job"" and ""not get into the theology of whether or not a second referendum should be held"".The Herald newspaper said it had asked Sir Michael whether the UK government would facilitate a referendum during the lifetime of this parliament.It quoted the Conservative politician as replying: ""No, forget it. The respect agenda is two way.""She [Ms Sturgeon] is constantly asking us to respect the SNP government, but she has to respect the decision of the Scotland to stay inside the UK in 2014 and the decision of the UK to leave the EU.""Respect works both ways."" Sir Michael was speaking ahead of a visit to Midlothian engineering firm MacTaggart Scott designs, at which he said the Treasury had approved the initial business case for a training school for naval crews working on the UK's nuclear submarines.The submarine school would be built at the Faslane naval base on the Clyde, which will be home to all 11 Royal Navy submarines from 2020 in a move which will see the number of people employed there rise from 6,800 to 8,200.Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson opposes a second referendum being held - but said last year that she did not believe the UK government should block one. Ms Sturgeon tweeted that there had been ""serious backpedalling from Michael Fallon on GMS on blocking #indyref2. Must have realised what a disastrous move it would be for Tories.""She later told Holyrood: ""If this parliament voted to have a referendum on independence, then absolutely I agree that no Westminster Tory should stand in the way of the voice of this parliament.""The mandate of this government in relation to this is unequivocal - it was the Tories after all who put us in the position of being taken out of the European Union against our will, and with the support of only one of the 59 MPs in this country.""Strange is it not that a Tory party that proclaims that it would be so confident of winning a referendum on independence now talks about trying to block it. ""Isn't it the case that the Tories are actually running a wee bit feart?"" "
2017-02-01,SNP and Greens strike Scots budget deal,https://web.archive.org//web/20170202115814/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-38828873,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe Scottish budget has been voted through the first stage of the legislative process after a deal between the SNP and Greens.MSPs backed Finance Secretary Derek Mackay's tax and spending plans by a margin of 67 to 59.A deal was struck with the Greens totalling £220m of extra spending, including £160m for local authorities.The deal will also see the threshold for the 40p rate of income tax frozen at £43,000.The same threshold is being raised to £45,000 in the rest of the UK, so the move means higher-rate tax payers elsewhere will pay up to £400 less tax every year than people earning the same wage in Scotland. The Scottish government had originally planned to raise the threshold only by the rate of inflation.Green co-convener Patrick Harvie told MSPs that his party had secured ""the biggest budget compromise in the history of devolution in Scotland"".Speaking at First Minister's Questions, Nicola Sturgeon said her priority was not to cut taxes for the top 10% earning Scottish taxpayers.But Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson accused Ms Sturgeon of setting out to make Scotland the highest taxed part of the UK.Previous votes on the budget proposals and on taxation had failed to find any consensus between the parties.However Mr Mackay confirmed on Thursday morning that a deal had been struck with the Greens, centred around £160m of extra funding for the core council grant.It will also see £25m extra for the police reform budget and £35m for Scottish Enterprise, and a freezing of the higher 40p rate of tax at £43,000. The threshold for this rate in the rest of the UK is to rise to £45,000.Mr Mackay said this would only affect 10% of the population, who would end up paying more tax than people earning the same amount in the rest of the UK. He said the ""income forgone amounts to £7.70 a week - less than the cost of a prescription in England"".356,00Approximate total number13%Working population£43,000 Start of 40p tax rate (2016/ 17) £43,430 Start of 40p tax rate (2017/18) £7.70 Value of inflation rise per week Mr Mackay said: ""I entered into discussions with all parties in good faith in order to build the consensus we need to deliver a budget for Scotland. I particularly welcome the constructive approach taken by the Scottish Greens.""My latest assessment of the financial position this year and our projections for 2017/18 has enabled me to identify available resources to support additional spending. ""I therefore propose, with the support of the Scottish Green party for all stages of this budget to allocate additional resources, of £160m, to local government to be spent at the discretion of individual authorities.""Once again this government has listened and acted.""Challenged about the deal by Labour's Kezia Dugdale, Mr Harvie said he believed the Scottish government had ""given far less ground than I think they could on taxation"".But he added: ""The reality though is £160m additional [funding] going into the un-ringfenced local government allocation.""The fact that the Scottish government found this money in other ways [than taxation] is not what I would have wished.""This is not a budget I would have written, but nobody who cares about protecting public services in Scotland can look at that extra £160m investment and say, no thanks, I'd rather just keep ranting and make no difference in people's lives.""Mr Harvie was attacked by other opposition leaders from across the chamber.Ms Dugdale said:  ""To accept anything less than bold use of this parliament's tax powers is an astonishing and deeply disappointing revelation from the Greens.""And let's not kid ourselves. This isn't the Greens' responsibility to parliament shining through, it's the responsibility they have put on themselves to do nothing which might jeopardise the prospect of another divisive independence referendum.""This is the truth - nationalism first, austerity second, and somewhere down the list of credentials you might just find the environment.""Ms Dugdale said this be remembered as the day the Greens ""abandoned any claim to be a party of the progressive left"".Tory MSP Murdo Fraser meanwhile accused the SNP front bench of ""swallowing hook, line and sinker the Green Party's hard-left, high-tax agenda"".He said: ""They have let Patrick Harvie pull all the strings and it will be hard working Scottish families that suffer as a consequence.""The finance secretary had a choice going into today's debate. He could have come with us, drop his plans to make Scotland the highest taxed part of the United Kingdom and work together with us to deliver an ambitious Budget focused on growing the economy.""Or he could turn sharp left and embrace the anti-growth, anti-business agenda of the Green Party. What a pity, what a tragedy for Scotland that he chose to throw in his lot with the lentil-munching, sandal-wearing watermelons on that side of the chamber.""The Lib Dems had asked for up to £400m in spending commitments for mental health, education, policing and transport, but later indicated that ""the distance is too great"" between the parties.The party's leader, Willie Rennie, said the Greens had abandoned earlier pledges about a ""greener, bolder"" Holyrood and were now backing a ""timorous and grey deal"".He said the SNP had ""turned down an opportunity"" to do a deal with the Lib Dems, which he said would have seen millions invested in education and mental health.He said: ""All of that has been turned down today in pursuit of an agenda that was contrary to what they promised that they would deliver.""So I think the SNP have missed a big opportunity. I think they are hollow with their promises and we will cast a harsher eye over them in future years when they promise to make a big change to Scottish society.""With the general principles of the bill now approved by members, it will move on to be debated at committee level.Stage three would see separate votes on tax and spending proposals in the chamber in the week beginning 20 February. Mr Mackay confirmed a deal had been agreed for ""all stages""."

""They used to keep it under the ground. Now they're coming out. A lid has been lifted off.""The CST, which has recorded data since 1984, said a perceived increase in racism and xenophobia following the EU referendum and greater discussion of anti-Semitism in the Labour Party could explain the rise.Ms Rudd described anti-Semitism as a ""deplorable form of hatred"".She said: ""It is vital we ensure the safety and security of our Jewish community and this government will continue to do all we can to stamp out these vile attacks and encourage those who experience them to come forward.""Communities Secretary Sajid Javid added: ""Anti-Semitism must be understood for what it is - an attack on the identity of people who live, contribute and are valued in our society.Last year Labour held an inquiry into allegations of anti-Semitism in the party, following the suspension of MP Naz Shah and ex-London mayor Ken Livingstone.Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson said the findings of the report were ""extremely distressing"", adding: ""We must root out anti-Semitism whenever it takes place and wherever it exists, as a party and as a country."""

He said the affair was not just a judicial matter but an ethical and moral one, and an urgent decision had to be made.Recently the favourite to win the presidency in elections in April and May, he has now slipped behind Ms Le Pen and centrist Emmanuel Macron. Mr Fillon said he would fight the accusations ""to the end"" on Wednesday but commentators suggested his fate was slipping out of his hands.Socialist candidate Benoit Hamon ridiculed the idea of a left-wing coup, saying it was ""a bit curious to search for plots where there aren't any"".Francois Fillon's chances of political survival are hanging on a thread, and if you want to know why just listen to French talk radio.This morning on RMC when broadcaster Jean-Jacques Bourdin took calls about Penelopegate, the mood was angry.Caller after caller pointed up the vast difference in their own salary, and the money - up to €10,000 ($10,800; £8,540) a month - which Penelope Fillon took as her husband's parliamentary assistant.

2017-02-01,Commons overwhelmingly backs Brexit bill,https://web.archive.org//web/20170202115814/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38833883,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkMPs have voted by a majority of 384 to allow Prime Minister Theresa May to get Brexit negotiations under way.They backed the government's European Union Bill, supported by the Labour leadership, by 498 votes to 114.But the SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Liberal Democrats opposed the bill, while 47 Labour MPs and Tory ex-chancellor Ken Clarke rebelled.The bill now faces further scrutiny in the Commons and the House of Lords before it can become law.The prime minister has set a deadline of 31 March for invoking Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, getting official talks with the EU started. The bill returns to the Commons next week.MPs held two days of debate on the bill, which follows last June's referendum in which voters opted by 51.9% to 48.1% in favour of Brexit.Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, a leading Leave campaigner, called the Commons result ""absolutely momentous"". Speaking on Facebook, he added: ""We may be leaving the EU treaties. We are not leaving Europe.""The UK would ""forge a new identity"" and make ""an amazingly positive contribution"" to Europe, he said.By Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editorThis time last year few in Westminster really thought that this would happen. The then prime minister's concern was persuading the rest of the EU to give him a better deal for the UK. His close colleagues believed the chances of them losing, let alone the government dissolving over the referendum, were slim, if not quite zero.This isn't even the last vote on this bill. There are several more stages, the Lords are likely to kick up rough at the start. But after tonight, for better or worse, few will believe that our journey to the exit door can be halted.Read Laura's blogSorry, your browser cannot display this content.Enter your postcode, or the name or constituency of your MPLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn had imposed a three-line whip - the strongest sanction at his disposal - on his MPs to back the bill.Shadow cabinet members Rachael Maskell and Dawn Butler quit the party's front bench shortly before the vote, in order to defy his orders.Also, 13 Labour frontbenchers voted against their own party position, apparently without first resigning.Mr Corbyn said: ""Labour MPs voted more than three to one in favour of triggering Article 50. Now the battle of the week ahead is to shape Brexit negotiations to put jobs, living standards and accountability centre stage.""Labour's amendments are the real agenda. The challenge is for MPs of all parties to ensure the best deal for Britain, and that doesn't mean giving Theresa May a free hand to turn Britain into a bargain-basement tax haven.""One MP was heard to shout ""Suicide"" when the result of the vote was announced.Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron, seven of whose nine MPs voted against the government, said: ""The Tories and Labour have failed future generations today by supporting a hard Brexit.""Labour's leadership tonight have waved the white flag. They are not an opposition; they are cheerleaders.""MPs will discuss the bill in more detail next week when it reaches its committee stage in the Commons, during which amendments to the government's plans will be discussed.The SNP's foreign affairs spokesman at Westminster, Alex Salmond, said: ""Next week there will be detailed questions and the calibre of the government will be judged by how they respond to the amendments.""Plaid Cymru's Westminster group leader, Hywel Williams, called Labour's stance ""deeply disappointing"", adding: ""This was not a vote on whether to accept the referendum result. It was a vote on whether to endorse the Tories' extreme version of Brexit.""Ken Clarke, the only Conservative MP to defy his party by voting against the bill, said the result was ""historic"", but the ""mood could change"" when the ""real action"" of negotiations with the EU starts.Earlier, the Commons voted against an SNP amendment aimed at scuppering the bill.The bill was published last week, after the Supreme Court decided MPs and peers must have a say before Article 50 could be triggered.It rejected the government's argument that Mrs May had sufficient powers to trigger Brexit without consulting Parliament.Talks with the EU are expected to last up to two years, with the UK predicted to leave the 28-member organisation in 2019."

2017-02-01,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20170202115814/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThis article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide to the UK's vote to leave the European Union. It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 52% to 48%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%, as did Wales, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who resigned on the day after losing the referendum. Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she says she will respect the will of the people. She has said ""Brexit means Brexit"" but there is still a lot of debate about what that will mean in practice especially on the two key issues of how British firms do business in the European Union and what curbs are brought in on the rights of European Union nationals to live and work in the UK. She set out more details of her negotiating hopes in her key speech on Brexit.The UK economy appears to have weathered the initial shock of the Brexit vote, although the value of the pound remains near a 30-year low, but opinion is sharply divided over the long-term effects of leaving the EU. Some major firms such as Easyjet and John Lewis have pointed out that the slump in sterling has increased their costs. Britain also lost its top AAA credit rating, meaning the cost of government borrowing will be higher. But share prices have recovered from a dramatic slump in value, with both the FTSE 100 and the broader FTSE 250 index, which includes more British-based businesses, trading higher than before the referendum. The Bank of England cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - a record low and the first cut since 2009 - after the vote and there has not been the economic slump or recession that some had predicted. Here is a regularly updated detailed rundown of how Britain's economy is doingThe European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it has to invoke an agreement called Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May has said she intends to trigger this process by the end of March 2017, meaning the UK will be expected to have left by the summer of 2019, depending on the precise timetable agreed during the negotiations. The government will also enact a Great Repeal Bill which will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. It is expected to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove.After a court battle, the UK's Supreme Court has ruled that Parliament must be consulted before Article 50 is invoked. This is why a two line Brexit bill is currently making its way through Parliament. MPs and Lords have to vote on it.The court verdict was not what the government argued for, but ministers have insisted it will not delay their planned timetable.Most MPs are expected to vote in favour of Article 50 being triggered, although there could be attempts to amend the draft legislation.Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These men - dubbed the Three Brexiteers - will play a central role in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although it will be Mrs May, as prime minister, who will have the final say. The government did not do any emergency planning for Brexit ahead of the referendum and Mrs May has rejected calls to say what her negotiating goals are.Once Article 50 has been triggered, the UK will have two years to negotiate its withdrawal. But no one really knows how the Brexit process will work - Article 50 was only created in late 2009 and it has never been used. Former Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, now Chancellor, wanted Britain to remain in the EU, and he has suggested it could take up to six years for the UK to complete exit negotiations. The terms of Britain's exit will have to be agreed by 27 national parliaments, a process which could take some years, he has argued. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. The UK will continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making.Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Following Theresa May's Brexit recent speech we now know that the UK is not intending to stay in the EU's single market. Although there has been speculation for months about the issue, it would have meant the UK staying under the auspices of the European Court of Justice and having to allow unlimited EU immigration, under freedom of movement rules.Both sides want trade to continue after Brexit with the UK seeking a positive outcome for those who wish to trade goods and services"" - such as those in the City of London and wanting a ""comprehensive free trade deal"" giving the UK ""the greatest possible access"" to the single market. Mrs May says she wants the UK to reach a new customs union deal with the EU. A customs union is where countries agree not to impose tariffs on each others' goods and have a common tariff on goods coming in from elsewhere. The UK is currently part of the EU customs union but that stops the UK being able to do its own trade deals with other countries. Reality Check: How could customs union work?These terms have increasingly been used as debate focused on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people in order to maintain access to the EU single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result.The government has declined to give a firm guarantee about the status of EU nationals currently living in the UK, saying this is not possible without a reciprocal pledge from other EU members about the millions of British nationals living on the continent. EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, will be be able to stay, the chief civil servant at the Home Office has said. The rights of other EU nationals would be subject to negotiations on Brexit and the ""will of Parliament"", he added.A lot depends on the kind of deal the UK agrees with the EU. If it remains within the single market, it would almost certainly retain free movement rights, allowing UK citizens to work in the EU and vice versa. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.Again, it depends on whether the UK government decides to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages. Citizens' Advice has reminded people their rights have not changed yet and asked anyone to contact them if they think they have been discriminated against following the Leave vote.Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested EU migrants who come to the UK as Brexit nears may not be given the right to stay. He has said there might have to be a cut-off point if there was a ""surge"" in new arrivals.People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote.The day-to-day spending impact is likely to be more significant. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it to remain at least 10% below where it was on 23 June, in the long term. This means imported goods will consequently get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have already been seen and the issue was most notably illustrated by the dispute between Tesco and Marmite's makers about whether prices would be put up or not in the stores.The latest UK inflation figures, for December, showed the CPI inflation rate jumping to 1.6%, its highest level for two years with signs of more cost pressures set to feed through in the months to come.Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration.She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations. As mentioned above, the key issue is whether other EU nations will grant the UK access to the single market, if that is what it wants, while at the same time being allowed to restrict the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK.Mrs May has said she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. It is currently running at 330,000 a year, of which 184,000 are EU citizens, and 188,000 are from outside the EU - the figures include a 39,000 outflow of UK citizens.It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Liberal Democrats - who have just a handful of MPs - have vowed to halt Brexit and keep Britain in the EU if they were to win the next general election.Some commentators, including former House of Commons clerk Lord Lisvane, have argued that a further referendum would be needed to ratify whatever deal the UK hammers out with the EU, but there are few signs political leaders view this as a viable option.Yes. Theresa May has appeared keen to avoid a vote on her negotiating stance, to avoid having to give away her priorities, but Theresa May has said there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. It is worth mentioning that any deal also has to be agreed by the European Parliament - with British MEPs getting a chance to vote on it there.  While there could be limitations on British nationals' ability to live and work in EU countries, it seems unlikely they would want to deter tourists. There are many countries outside the European Economic Area, which includes the 28 EU nations plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway, that British citizens can visit for up to 90 days without needing a visa and it is possible that such arrangements could be negotiated with European countries.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. In theory, the government could, if it wanted, decide to change the colour, which is currently standardised for EU countries, says the BBC's Europe correspondent, Chris Morris.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketNo nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it is ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faces being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. A second independence referendum for the country is now ""highly likely"", she has said, although not in 2017. She has said she wants Scotland to stay in the single market and said Mrs May's decision to rule out the UK staying in the single market ""undoubtedly"" brings the referendum closer.Before his resignation Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said the impact in Northern Ireland would be ""very profound"" and that the whole island of Ireland should now be able to vote on reunification. But, speaking while she was still Northern Ireland Secretary, Theresa Villiers ruled out the call from Sinn Féin for a border poll, saying the circumstances in which one would be called did not exist. The land border is likely to be a key part of the Brexit talks. Theresa May said a priority for her would be negotiating a deal with the EU which allowed a common travel area between the UK and the Republic of Ireland.During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest. But his successor Theresa May has said she will keep it in place, at least for the current Parliament, which is due to last until 2020.So far there has been a cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. There are yet to be signs that rising inflation have worried the Bank of England  enough to consider raising interest rates.  But if that happened it would make mortgages and loans more expensive to repay - but would be good news for savers.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.Eurotunnel boss Jacques Gounon said last November the reintroduction of duty-free would be ""an incredible boost for my business"" but he later said  that remark had been ""light-hearted"". Erik Juul-Mortensen, president of the Tax Free World Association (TFWA) said after the referendum vote ""it is not possible to predict how Brexit will affect the duty free and travel retail industry, and it is wiser not to make assumptions about exactly what the impact will be.""  They are at the moment but no-one knows the longer term prospects for definite. The EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - is not an EU initiative. It was negotiated between countries within a group known as the European Economic Area, often simply referred to as the single market (plus Switzerland, which confusingly is not a member of the EEA, but has agreed access to the single market). Therefore, the future of Britons' EHIC cover could depend on whether the UK decided to sever ties with the EEA.Probably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report. In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two-thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.However, the UK government is committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, the UK government is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR. However, the EU has its own European Court of Justice, whose decisions are binding on EU institutions and member states.Its rulings have sometimes caused controversy in Britain and supporters of a Brexit have called for immediate legislation to curb its powers. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also cited sovereignty and democracy, and they wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Four of the biggest US banks have committed to helping maintain the City's position. But HSBC will move up to 1,000 jobs to Paris, the BBC understands. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Pest control firm Rentokil Initial says it could make £15m extra this year thanks to a weaker currency.Others are less optimistic. Hilary Jones, a director at UK cosmetics firm Lush said the company was ""terrified"" about the economic impact. She added that while the firm's Dorset factory would continue to produce goods for the UK market, products for the European market may be made at its new plant in Germany.Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Thanks for sending in your questions.

In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn.

After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After the Leave vote, the government will probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""As with most elements of the UK economy, not enough solid data has been published yet to accurately conclude the Brexit effect on house prices. Industry figures have pointed to ""uncertainty"" among buyers and sellers that could potentially change the housing market.So far, the most significant research has come from the respected Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which has published the conclusions of a survey of its members. This primarily records sentiment among surveyors.It found that house prices are expected to fall across the UK in the three months after the referendum vote. However, the dip in prices is only expected to persist over the 12 months from June in London and East Anglia, surveyors predict.House prices were already slowing in central London, owing to the fall-out from changes to stamp duty rules in April.Separate figures from property portal Rightmove suggested the average asking price of houses coming on to the market in England and Wales fell by 0.9%, or £2,647, in July compared with June. It said that agents had reported very few sales had fallen through as a result of the vote.Many potential first-time buyers would welcome a fall in house prices, with ownership among the young falling owing to affordability concerns. Investors in property, or those who have paid off a mortgage and hope to leave homes as inheritance would be unhappy with a long-term reduction in value.  Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law following the decision to leave the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" will not necessarily disappear overnight - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU means the UK will not be part of TTIP. It will have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Former Labour health secretary Lord Owen has said that because of TTIP (see answer above) the only way to protect the NHS from further privatisation was to get out of the EU."
2017-02-01,Who's Who: Theresa May's cabinet,https://web.archive.org//web/20170202115814/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36785814,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkTheresa May is forming her new government after becoming Conservative prime minister. She is continuing to announce her full cabinet - but here's what we know so far. The list will be updated as new appointments are made. Campaigned to Remain in the European Union The former home secretary, 59, becomes the UK's second female prime minister in the wake of David Cameron's resignation after the EU referendum. She had previously served in the Home Office for more than six years. Theresa May: Full profileHow does May's cabinet compare to Cameron's?Campaigned to Leave the EUBoris Johnson succeeds Philip Hammond at the Foreign Office. The former London mayor headed the campaign for the UK to leave the European Union. He did not previously have a ministerial appointment in Mr Cameron's government but accepted an invitation to attend political cabinet. He was not running any department. Mr Johnson, 52, may be one of the best known politicians in the country but the move to foreign secretary is a big step up from his previous role.Read how the world has reacted.Leave campaignerDavid Davis has been appointed to the new cabinet position of secretary of state for exiting the European Union - or ""Brexit secretary"". A veteran Eurosceptic, he has previously held the positions of Conservative party chairman and shadow deputy prime minister. Between 2003 and 2008, he was the shadow home secretary under both Michael Howard and David Cameron. Mr Davis, 67, lost to David Cameron in the 2005 Tory leadership contest. Details about the new Brexit department are still emerging, but it is likely to take the lead in negotiating Britain's departure from the EU and unpicking the thousands of pages of EU rules written into UK law.Theresa May is reported to have ordered civil servants to find a building for the new department.Leave campaignerLiam Fox, 54, has taken on another newly created position as secretary of state for international trade. He was made secretary of state for defence in 2010 but resigned in 2011 over allegations he had given a close friend, lobbyist Adam Werritty, access to the Ministry of Defence and allowed him to join official trips overseas.Like Mr Davis he is a Eurosceptic who voted to leave the EU and he also stood unsuccessfully for the Conservative Party leadership in 2005.He stood again in the latest race to be leader but was eliminated in the first ballot after winning the support of just 16 MPs.Remain campaignerThe appointment to chief whip is a big step up for Gavin Williamson, according to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg.David Cameron's former parliamentary private secretary, he also served as parliamentary private secretary to transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin.The 40-year-old from North Yorkshire was elected MP for South Staffordshire in 2010. As chief whip, he will attend Cabinet meetings.Remain campaignerKaren Bradley takes over from the deposed John Whittingdale as Culture, Media and Sport Secretary. She had been working with Theresa May as a Home Office minister since 2014.She was first elected MP for Staffordshire Moorlands in May 2010.Her appointment comes two months after Mr Whittingdale and the BBC agreed a major overhaul of the corporation.Read more about her appointment here.Leave campaignerAndrea Leadsom, the Conservative leadership candidate who dramatically pulled out of the race, is the new Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Secretary.The prominent Brexit backer is promoted from energy minister to a cabinet role which will see her take responsibility for a farming industry as it faces the end of European Union subsidies. She will also have to fashion a post-Brexit fisheries policy. Green campaigners will be watching carefully to see what happens to environment regulations in areas including wildlife habitats, air pollution and water quality, currently governed by rules from Europe. Mrs Leadsom's public reason for withdrawing from the leadership race was to allow a rapid transition at the top, and give the economy certainty in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. But our political editor Laura Kuenssberg says her friends were saying she was alarmed by the level of scrutiny given to her comments on motherhood reported in the Times.Read more on Mrs Leadsom's motivations for stepping aside here.Baroness Evans of Bowes Park becomes leader of the House of Lords at 40, in her first ministerial role since being ennobled by David Cameron in 2014.She attended London's Henrietta Barnett School and Cambridge University before becoming deputy director of the Conservative research department, deputy director of the Policy Exchange think-tank and chief operating officer of the New Schools Network - the organisation which ran Michael Gove's free schools programme.Remain campaignerDamian Green is appointed the new Work and Pensions Secretary, taking over from Stephen Crabb, who earlier resigned.Mr Green served as an Immigration Minister and Justice Secretary in the coalition government but has been on the backbenches since 2014.Leave campaignerPriti Patel is the new International Development Secretary, a promotion from her role as employment minister which she's held for just a year.Ms Patel became MP for Witham in 2010 and joined the front bench as a Treasury minister in 2014.She is no stranger to controversy, having previously advocated bringing back the death penalty and was accused of ""divide and rule politics"" during the referendum campaign for claiming that ""biased"" immigration policy prevents curry chefs from outside the EU from working in the UK.On her appointment, she immediately faced calls to guarantee the UK's legal commitment to spending 0.7% of GDP on overseas aid.Remain campaignerGreg Clark is secretary of state of a newly-created ministry of business, energy and industrial strategy.His appointment spells the end for a department which put climate change at the top of the agenda.Just eight years after it was created by then-prime minister Gordon Brown, the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) is being merged into Mr Clark's new department and losing the ""climate change"" part of its name.Environmentalists immediately expressed concern that the reshaping of departments showed the government was downgrading climate change as a priority.But Richard Black, director of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU), said Mr Clark's move was ""an excellent appointment"", saying he ""understands climate change, and has written influential papers on the benefits of Britain developing a low-carbon economy"".Remain campaignerJames Brokenshire, who has been working with Theresa May at the Home Office - where he was immigration minister - has been made Northern Ireland Secretary.He takes over from Theresa Villiers, who resigned from the cabinet having been offered another role but saying it was not one ""which I felt I could take on"". Before entering parliament Mr Brokenshire was a partner at a large international law firm.From 2011 to 2015, he served as security minister at the Home Office with responsibility for domestic national security and counter terrorism. This included supporting the home secretary with oversight of the work of MI5 and the national police counter-terrorism network.His responsibilities also included the government's counter-terrorism strategy and he was part of the prime minister's ""extremism taskforce"". He also led negotiations with the Jordanian government to secure the deportation of the radical cleric Abu Qatada.Read more on his appointment here.Remain campaignerDavid Lidington, former Europe Minister, is promoted to Leader of the House. He had been Europe Minister since 2010 but moves across to a post involving the smooth running of the Commons. The Cambridge history graduate and father-of-four has been MP for Aylesbury since 1992. He previously worked for BP and mining firm Rio Tinto.Campaigned to Remain in the EUPhilip Hammond has been named chancellor of the exchequer. He was foreign secretary under David Cameron from 2014 to 2016, having previously served as defence secretary and transport secretary. He replaces George Osborne.Mr Hammond, 60, is seen at Westminster as the ultimate safe pair of hands. Sometimes mocked as ""box office Phil"" for what some see as his dull delivery, he forged a reputation in the shadow Treasury team as the Tories' public spending ""axeman"".He was seen as a Eurosceptic who spoke of withdrawal if the EU were not reformed, but was a Remain campaigner in the referendum. He now has the job of steering Britain's economy through the choppy post-Brexit waters.Read what Mr Hammond has to say on his first day in the job.Remain campaignerAmber Rudd has been made home secretary, filling the vacancy left by Mrs May. Ms Rudd was formerly energy and climate change secretary, a position she held for just one year.During the campaign for Remain in the EU referendum, she warned in a TV debate that she would not trust the new Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson to drive her home at the end of a night out.The former investment banker, venture capitalist, and financial journalist, aged 52, decided to enter politics in her 40s in order to get ""a grip on her life"". She quickly joined the fast track to the top after being elected to Parliament as MP for Hastings and Rye. She was seen as a protege of then Chancellor George Osborne, serving as his parliamentary private secretary before being promoted to junior minister at the Energy and Climate Change department in 2014. Remain campaignerLiz Truss moves from her role as secretary for environment, food and rural affairs to replace Michael Gove as justice secretary.A qualified management accountant, she became MP for South West Norfolk in 2010 and was appointed education minister in 2012.She was brought up in Yorkshire and attended Roundhay, a comprehensive school in Leeds, and went on to read philosophy, politics and economics at Merton College, Oxford.Socially liberal, the 40-year-old was a founder member of the free enterprise group of Conservative MPs arguing for more deregulation of the economy.Remain campaignerJustine Greening has said she is ""absolutely delighted"" to be made the new education secretary, taking over from Nicky Morgan. She was also appointed minister for women and equalities. Her new department will also take on higher and further education, skills and apprenticeships.Ms Greening leaves her international development secretary post, which she was promoted to in October 2011.MP for Putney since 2005, she became economic secretary to the Treasury after the 2010 election, succeeding Philip Hammond as transport secretary after he was promoted to defence secretary.At London's Pride day on 25 June, two days after the Brexit vote, the 47-year-old announced in a tweet she was in a same-sex relationship, saying ""I campaigned for Stronger In but sometimes you're better off out!"".Read more about what's awaiting Ms Greening at the education department.Leave campaignerChris Grayling, Theresa May's leadership campaign chief, has been appointed transport secretary. He was formerly Leader of the House.The most pressing jobs in his in-tray include dealing with the travel chaos caused by Southern Rail's disrupted services, the expansion of airport capacity in south-east England and high speed rail link, HS2.He's got some experience in this department, having served as shadow transport secretary from December 2005 to 2007.The Brexiteer had a surprisingly low-key, restrained referendum, largely refraining from ""blue-on-blue"" attacks. He was also one of the few Vote Leave spokesmen to share a platform with former UKIP leader Nigel Farage. Remain campaignerPatrick McLoughlin leaves his role as transport secretary to become Conservative Party chairman and chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.An MP since 1986, the former miner also served as chief whip, after being appointed to the role in David Cameron's first cabinet.As transport secretary, he was in charge of several large-scale projects including Crossrail and HS2. The 58-year-old said he was ""very pleased indeed"" with his new role.Remain campaignerSajid Javid is moved sideways from business secretary to secretary of the department for communities and local government.Mr Javid, considered a protege of former chancellor George Osborne's, held the culture secretary position before being appointed to the business role last year and is a former managing director of Deutsche Bank. The 46-year-old University of Exeter graduate stood on a ""joint ticket"" with Stephen Crabb for the leadership election, hoping to be chancellor if Mr Crabb had become PM.Remain campaignerMichael Fallon has kept his job at the Ministry of Defence - a position the 64-year-old has held since 2014.He was Conservative MP for Darlington from 1983 to 1992 - initially during Margaret Thatcher's time in Downing Street - and after leaving Parliament, he was later re-elected as MP for Sevenoaks in 1997.A former Conservative Party deputy chairman, he has previously served as energy and business minister, and before that secretary of state for business and enterprise.Seen as a safe pair of hands in Westminster, he described himself as a ""pretty reluctant Remainer"" after the EU referendum.Remain campaignerDespite earlier speculation, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt remains in his post.The 49-year-old was appointed culture secretary in David Cameron's first coalition government, a role he held for two years - including while London played host to the 2012 Olympic Games.He took over the health portfolio following a cabinet reshuffle in 2012, and described the appointment as the ""biggest privilege of my life"". Most recently, Mr Hunt has been locked in a battle with the British Medical Association over a new contract for junior doctors, which has led to a series of strikes.Remain campaignerDavid Mundell will continue as Secretary of State for Scotland.Mr Mundell, the only Scottish Conservative MP, said his focus was now on ""ensuring Scotland gets the best possible deal out of the EU negotiations"".Former prime minister David Cameron first appointed Mr Mundell to the post when he held his Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale seat for the third consecutive election in 2015.Remain campaignerMay's cabinet: Who's in and who's out? Alun Cairns, MP for the Vale of Glamorgan, remains in his cabinet role as secretary of state for Wales.He was appointed to the post just four months ago so there was little surprise that he will retain his position. The 45-year-old, who was born in Swansea and is a graduate of the University of Wales, Newport, was elected as MP for the Vale of Glamorgan in 2010. He worked in banking for a decade before his election to the Welsh Assembly. Remain campaignerGeorge Osborne has been fired as chancellor.He had been in the Treasury since 2010 - throughout David Cameron's tenure in Downing Street. He had also been first secretary of state since May 2015. A key ally of Mr Cameron, Mr Osborne tweeted it had been a ""privilege"" to be chancellor, adding: ""Others will judge - I hope I've left the economy in a better state than I found it.""Leave campaignerMichael Gove has been fired as justice secretary. The former Times journalist also served under David Cameron as education secretary in the coalition government, and as chief whip.He successfully campaigned for Brexit alongside Boris Johnson - but later withdrew his support for his colleague to be Conservative leader and prime minister, instead standing himself. He was eliminated in the final round of voting by MPs in third place.His surprise move to stand for the leadership and therefore to become prime minister effectively dashed Mr Johnson's hopes of running.Remain campaignerNicky Morgan is to leave her post as education secretary. The 43-year-old, who qualified as a lawyer, became an MP in 2010 and rose to the cabinet position of minister for women and equalities in 2013.London-born Ms Morgan replaced Michael Gove as education secretary in 2014. She reportedly considered standing in the Conservative leadership contest, but ultimately threw her support behind leave campaigner Mr Gove, despite campaigning for a Remain vote herself.In a tweet, she said she was ""disappointed"" not to be continuing her work in the education department, before congratulating her successor Justine Greening, saying she was ""committed to excellence in education"".Remain campaignerWork and Pensions Secretary Stephen Crabb has resigned from government ""in the best interests of my family"". He was one of the four contenders who lost out to Theresa May for the Conservative leadership.BBC political correspondent Vicki Young says it's not yet known whether Mr Crabb was offered a post he did not want or had just decided to resign from the government, possibly following some newspaper stories about his private life at the weekend. Read more about Mr Crabb here.Leave campaignerJohn Whittingdale has left his post as culture secretary. The Leave campaigner was vice-chairman of the influential group of Tory MPs called the 1922 Committee until he took over the portfolio for culture, media and sport after the general election in 2015 from Sajid Javid.In a tweet, he said it had been ""a privilege"" to serve as culture secretary, and wished his successor ""every success"".  Leave campaignerTheresa Villiers steps down as Northern Ireland secretary, saying she declined an offer of another role from the new prime minister.Former barrister Ms Villiers, MP for Chipping Barnet, had held the Northern Ireland portfolio since 2012. Prior to that, she was a Member of the European Parliament for six years.In December 2005, Mr Cameron promoted her to shadow chief secretary to the Treasury. In 2007, she was made a shadow transport minister, a brief she continued to hold when the coalition came to power.She was among prominent figures who campaigned for Brexit. She said Mrs May had been ""kind enough to offer me a role"" but added that it was ""not one which I felt I could take on"".Read more about Ms Villiers here.Remain campaignerOliver Letwin has been sacked from his role as Cabinet Office minister and chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.The long-time MP started his political career as a policy adviser to Margaret Thatcher's government. After becoming elected an MP in 1997 he went on to serve in high profile shadow cabinet posts under then Tory-leader Michael Howard, including shadow home secretary and shadow chancellor.A mainstay of the Cameron years, he served as minister for government policy under the coalition government, and continued as a cabinet member following the 2015 general election.However, the 60-year-old may be better known by some for throwing parliamentary papers into a public bin in St James's Park and apologising for comments he made about black people days after the 1985 Broadwater Farm riot in north London. Remain campaignerChief Whip Mark Harper leaves his post to make way for David Cameron's former parliamentary private secretary Gavin Williamson.In a tweet, the MP for the Forest of Dean, who held the chief whip post for one year, said: ""I have decided to leave the Government & return to the backbenches. I'll continue to loyally support HMG & @theresa_may as our new PM."" Remain campaignerBaroness Stowell of Beeston moves aside as Leader of the House of Lords, to be succeeded by 40-year-old Baroness Evans.Of her successor, she tweeted: ""Baroness Evans will be a fantastic Leader of the House of Lords. She is a great woman. Congratulations and much love to Nats.""Nottingham-born Baroness Stowell was appointed to the Lords role in July 2014, having become a peer in 2011.Before taking up her peerage, she worked for the BBC, as a civil servant and ran William Hague's office when he was leader of the Conservative Party."
2017-02-01,The Jeremy Corbyn Story,https://web.archive.org//web/20170202115814/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-34184265,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkJeremy Corbyn's election in September 2015 as Labour leader, at the age of 66, counted as one of the biggest upsets in British political history.His re-election to the post almost a year later was not such a surprise but could prove even more momentous in terms of Labour's direction in the coming years and the future course of British politics.Seeing off the challenge of Owen Smith, who had the backing of the majority of Labour MPs, has made Mr Corbyn, for the time being at least, seemingly unassailable and increased the likelihood that he will lead the opposition into the next general election - scheduled for 2020.If that is the case, Mr Corbyn will be a highly influential figure during one of the most important political periods of the past 50 years - as the clock ticks down to the UK's exit from the EU following the Brexit referendum vote. To his critics, he is almost a caricature of the archetypal ""bearded leftie"", an unelectable throwback to the dark days of the 1980s, when Labour valued ideological purity more than winning power.But to his army of supporters he is the only honest man left in politics, someone who can inspire a new generation of activists, and make them believe that there is an alternative to the neo-liberal Thatcherite consensus that has let them down so badly.A fixture on the British left for more than 40 years, he has been an almost ever-present figure at demos and marches, a joiner of committees, a champion of controversial causes, a tireless pamphleteer, handy with a megaphone.But not even his most ardent admirers would have had him down as a future leader of Her Majesty's opposition. And not just because he believes in the abolition of the Monarchy.Corbyn's brand of left-wing politics was meant to have been consigned to the dustbin of history by New Labour.He belongs to what had been a dwindling band of MPs, which also includes Diane Abbott and John McDonnell, who held fast to their socialist principles as their party marched moved right - and into power - under Tony Blair.At the start of the 2015 leadership contest, after scraping on to the ballot paper at the last minute, thanks to charity nominations from Labour MPs who wanted a token left-wing candidate to ""broaden the debate"", he explained to The Guardian why he had decided to run. ""Well, Diane and John have done it before, so it was my turn."" Asked if he had taken some persuading, he replied: ""Yeah. I have never held any appointed office, so in that sense it's unusual, but if I can promote some causes and debate by doing this, then good. That's why I'm doing it."" He added: ""At my age I'm not likely to be a long-term contender, am I?""That view was quickly revised as Corbynmania took hold. Something about the Islington North MP struck a chord with Labour leadership voters in a way that his three younger, more polished, more careerist, rivals patently did not.Despite, or perhaps because, of his unassuming, low-key style, he seemed able to inspire people who had lost faith in Labour during the Blair/Brown years and bring hope to young activists fired up by his anti-austerity message. His entry into the contest also prompted a surge in people - many from the left of the existing Labour membership - joining the party or paying £3 to become registered supporters. His perceived integrity and lifelong commitment to the socialist cause made him an attractive option to many left-wing voters jaded by the spin and soundbites of the Westminster political classes. Over the course of a year or so since becoming leader he has become something of a cult figure - ironic for someone who always insisted he didn't do personality politics and had never tried to cultivate a following among MPs.Instead of amusing anecdotes about youthful indiscretions, or tales of climbing Westminster's greasy pole, his political biography is dominated by the list of the causes he has championed and committees he has served on.He once confessed he had never smoked cannabis - practically unheard of in the left-wing circles he grew up in, but the mark of a man who is known for his austere, almost ascetic, approach to life.His frugality is legendary. He usually has the lowest expenses claims of any MP.""Well, I don't spend a lot of money, I lead a very normal life, I ride a bicycle and I don't have a car,"" he told The Guardian.Asked what his favourite biscuit was during a Mumsnet Q&A , he answered: ""I'm totally anti-sugar on health grounds, so eat very few biscuits, but if forced to accept one, it's always a pleasure to have a shortbread.""Jeremy Bernard Corbyn had an impeccable middle-class upbringing.He spent his early years in the picturesque Wiltshire village of Kington St Michael. When he was seven, the family moved to a seven-bedroomed manor house in the hamlet of Pave Lane, in Shropshire. The youngest of four boys, he enjoyed an idyllic childhood in what he himself has called a rural ""Tory shire"". Personal life: Lives with third wife. Has three sons from earlier marriage.Food and drink: A vegetarian who rarely drinks alcohol. According to The Guardian, his favourite restaurant is Gaby's diner in London's West End, where he likes to eat hummus after taking part in demonstrations in Trafalgar Square.Hobbies: Running, cycling, cricket and Arsenal football club. According to the Financial Times: ""He loves making jam with fruit grown on his allotment, belongs to the All Party Parliamentary Group for Cheese and is a borderline trainspotter."" He does not own a car. He is known for having an unusual hobby - an interest in the history and design of manhole covers.Culture: A lover of the works of Irish poet WB Yeats. His favourite novelist is said to be the late Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe, whose most famous work, Things Fall Apart, is about the tensions between colonialism and traditional societies. He is a fluent Spanish speaker and enjoys Latin American literature. His favourite films are said to be The Great Gatsby and Casablanca.His brother Piers, now a meteorologist known for denying climate change is a product of human activity, has described the Corbyn boys as ""country bumpkins"".Corbyn disagrees with his brother on climate change but they remain close. They both learned their politics at the family dinner table, where left-wing causes and social justice were a frequent topic of debate.Their maths teacher mother Naomi and electrical engineer father David were peace campaigners who met at a London rally for supporters of Spain's Republicans in the fight against Franco's fascists.Piers, who would go on to be a well-known squatters leader in 1960s London, was even further to the left than Jeremy. Both boys joined the local Wrekin Labour Party and the Young Socialists while still at school.Corbyn had begun his education at the fee-paying preparatory school, Castle House, in Newport, before moving into the state sector, after passing his 11-plus.He was one of only two Labour-supporting boys at Adams Grammar School, in Newport, when his class held a mock election in 1964.In an interview with The Sun, his friend Bob Mallett recalls Corbyn being jeered by his right-wing schoolmates: ""Jeremy was the Labour candidate and I his campaign manager because at a middle-class boarding grammar school in leafy Shropshire, there weren't many socialists. We were trounced.""Corbyn left Adams with two A levels, both at grade E, and an enduring hatred of selective education.""It was an illegal war and therefore [Tony Blair] has to explain to that. Is he going to be tried for it? I don't know. Could he be tried for it? Possibly,"" on the Iraq war.""Are super-rich people actually happy with being super-rich? I would want the super rich to pay properly their share of the needs of the rest of the community,"" on Channel 4 News.""He was a fascinating figure who observed a great deal and from whom we can learn a great deal,"" on Karl Marx to the BBC's Andrew Marr.""Without exception, the majority electricity, gas, water and railway infrastructures of Britain were built through public investment since the end of WW2 and were all privatised at knockdown prices for the benefit of greedy asset-strippers by the Thatcher and Major-led Tory governments,"" in his column for the Morning Star newspaper.""Some people say to me, are we still worried about Hiroshima. My reply is that the weapons were used specifically against civilians and while 'fireworks' compared to what is now available, killed and have killed for the past 59 years. Nuclear weapons have saved no lives, killed thousands and maimed many more and impoverished the poor nations who have them,"" on his website.""I started wearing a beard when I was 19 and living in Jamaica; they called me 'Mr Beardman,'"" on winning the Beard Liberation Front's Beard of the Year award in 2002.He reportedly split up with his second wife Claudia after she insisted on sending their son Ben - now a football coach with Premier League Watford - to Queen Elizabeth Grammar School, in Barnet, instead of an Islington comprehensive.After leaving school, Corbyn spent two years in Jamaica, with Voluntary Service Overseas, something he has described as an ""amazing"" experience. Back in the UK he threw himself into trade union activism, initially with now long defunct National Union of Tailors and Garment Makers.He started a course in Trade Union Studies at North London Polytechnic but left after a series of arguments with his tutors over the curriculum.""He probably knew more than them,"" Piers told The Sun.A successful career as a trade union organiser followed, with the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union (AEEU) and then the National Union of Public Employees (NUPE).But his real passion was for Labour Party politics - and in 1974 he was elected to Haringey District Council, in North London.In the same year he married fellow Labour councillor, Jane Chapman, a university lecturer.Chapman says she married Corbyn for his ""honesty"" and ""principles"" but she soon grew weary of his intense focus on politics. ""Politics became our life. He was out most evenings because when we weren't at meetings he would go to the Labour headquarters, and do photocopying - in those days you couldn't print because there were no computers,' she told The Mail on Sunday.""Jeremy is a saintly figure of enormous personal integrity. He is a man who lives his life according to his beliefs,"" former Labour MP Chris Mullin, speaking to Panorama.""If Jeremy Corbyn becomes leader it won't be a defeat like 1983 or 2015 at the next election. It will mean rout, possibly annihilation"", former Labour leader and prime minister Tony Blair.""The showbiz glitz of New Labour temporarily hid the hole where the heart of Labour was supposed to be. Now the 'Corbynites' (whoever expected to use that phrase?) are trying to hide that hole behind some old banners and a bloke with a beard,"" left-wing commentator Mick Hume.""There is something inherently virtuous about him, and that is a quality that can rally the support of a lot of people, and most importantly, a lot of young people,"" singer and activist Charlotte Church (pictured).""While most of his chums have all moderated their views, dumped their corduroy jackets and grey suits, shaved their beards and quietly cancelled their CND subscriptions, [he] has hardly changed a bit; he is the Fidel Castro of London N1,"" Telegraph journalist Robert Hardman.They shared a love of animals, they had a tabby cat called Harold Wilson, and enjoyed camping holidays together in Europe on Corbyn's motorbike.But fun was in short supply at home, recalls Chapman, who remains in touch with Corbyn and backed his leadership bid.During their five years together he never once took her dinner, she told The Mail, preferring instead to ""grab a can of beans and eat it straight from the can"" to save time.In 1987, Corbyn married Claudia Bracchita, a Chilean exile, with whom he had three sons. The youngest, Tommy, was born while Corbyn was lecturing NUPE members elsewhere in the same hospital. Twenty-five-year-old Seb has been helping out on his father's leadership campaign. The couple separated in 1999, but remained on good terms. Corbyn got married for a third time last year, to his long term partner Laura Alvarez, a 46-year-old Mexican fair trade coffee importer.In the bitter internal warfare that split Labour in the late 1970s and early eighties, Corbyn was firmly on the side of the quasi-Marxist hard left. A Labour man to his fingertips - he was no Militant ""entryist"" trying to infiltrate the party by stealth - he nevertheless found common cause with former Trotskyists such as Ted Knight, and joined them in their battle to push the party to the left.He became a disciple of Tony Benn, sharing his mentor's brand of democractic socialism, with its belief in worker controlled industries and state planning of the economy, as well as Benn's commitment to unilateral nuclear disarmament and a united Ireland.Here is just a small selection of the campaigns Jeremy Corbyn has been involved with over the past 50 years.Nuclear disarmament: Joined CND as a schoolboy in 1966Irish Republicanism: Organised Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams' visit to the Commons in 1983. Once employed Irish Republican dissident Ronan Bennett as a member of staff at WestminsterMiners' strike: Invited striking miners into Commons gallery in 1985 who were expelled for shouting ""Coal not Dole""Anti-Apartheid: serving on the National Executive of the Anti-Apartheid Movement, and was arrested in 1984 for protesting outside South Africa HousePalestinian solidarity: A member of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign and campaigns regularly against the conflict in GazaMiscarriages of justice: Worked on on behalf of the Guildford Four and Birmingham Six, who were eventually found to be have been wrongly convicted of IRA bombings in England in the mid-1970sAnimal rights: Joined the League Against Cruel Sports at school, became a vegetarian at 20, after working on a pig farmIraq war: Chaired the Stop the War coalitionGay rights: Spoke out in 1983 on a ""No socialism without gay liberation"" platform and continued to campaign for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender rightsCorbyn was never seen as a great orator like Benn, or a firebrand like miners' leader Arthur Scargill, but he worked tirelessly behind the scenes, his trousers stained with purple ink from the copying machines that produced the pamphlets and newspapers that were the lifeblood of the British Left in the pre-internet era.He ran the London Labour Briefing newspaper, which helped propel Ken Livingstone to power on the Greater London Council.He was elected to Parliament in 1983, to represent his home patch of Islington North, a seat he has held ever since and where he has increased his majority from 5,600 to 21,000, and as a back benchers was by most accounts a popular and hard-working MP.The Bennite faction that Corbyn belonged to was already in retreat, following their leader's failure to capture the deputy leadership of the party in 1981.After fighting and losing the 1983 election on arguably the most left-wing manifesto it had ever put before the British public, with its commitment to renationalising the utilities just privatised by the Thatcher government, pulling out of the EU, nuclear disarmament and the creation of a ""national investment bank"" to create jobs, Labour began the painful process of ""modernisation"" that led to the birth of New Labour.And Corbyn would spend the next 32 years on the backbenches fighting a rearguard action against his party's abandonment of the radical policies and values contained in the '83 manifesto in the name of electability, under Neil Kinnock, John Smith and, most notably, Tony Blair.Corbyn might have hailed from the same North London district as Blair and entered Parliament in the same year but that is where the similarity ended.He abhorred Blair's embrace of free market economics and did his best to be a thorn in the younger man's side throughout his time in Downing Street, although Blair's large majorities ensured the damage was barely noticeable.He would always vote with his conscience, rather than be dictated to by the party whips. It earned him the accolade of being Labour's most rebellious MP, defying the party managers more than 500 times.It also meant he and his allies became increasingly isolated, with their views and interventions ignored by the mainstream media and most of their colleagues on the Labour benches.Blair's dire warnings that Labour would face ""annihilation"" if it elected Corbyn during the leadership contest were met by Corbyn with a suggestion that his predecessor as Labour leader should probably face trial for war crimes over his role in the Iraq war.Corbyn and his comrades - unlike their modernising colleagues they would use the term without irony - routinely attached themselves to any cause that felt like it would strike a blow against British and American ""imperialism"" or the Israeli state.Internationalist in outlook, they would proclaim solidarity with socialist campaigns and governments in places like Cuba, Chile, Nicaragua, El Salvador and attack US policies that, in Corbyn's view, enslaved the Latin American world.He incurred the wrath of the Labour leadership early on his career when he invited two former IRA prisoners to speak at Westminster, two weeks after the Brighton bomb that had nearly killed Margaret Thatcher and her cabinet. Later on it would be his willingness to share platforms with representatives of Hamas and Hezbollah that would put him at the centre of controversy. When challenged, he insists he does not share their views but that peace will never be achieved without talking to all sides.He may have been largely sidelined in the House of Commons, respected but too much of a known quantity to have an impact, but Corbyn's stature and profile outside Parliament continued to grow.He chaired the Stop the War Coalition and became a leading figure in the anti-austerity movement, which began to attract large crowds of young activists eager for something to believe in and to take the fight to then Prime Minister David Cameron.Still, no one gave Corbyn a prayer when he entered the contest to succeed Ed Miliband as Labour leader, with bookmakers offering a price of 200-1.His elevation to rock star status, among the crowds who flocked to his leadership campaign meetings, must have been as much of a shock to Corbyn as it was to his opponents, but he never showed it.He carried on, just as he always had, railing against inequality, talking about hope, promising to renationalise industries, tax the rich and scrap Trident, and wearing the same white, open-necked shirt with pens sticking out of the top pocket.Only now people were listening. During that leadership campaign Jeremy Corbyn is understood to have rejected pleas from some supporters for him to stand aside, having made his point and injected new life into Labour's left, to leave the field clear for a younger candidate who might have more electoral appeal. He appeared determined to make a go of the leadership.Many ""moderate"" shadow cabinet members returned to the backbenches rather than serve under him but he was able to put together a top team that reflected a broad range of opinion within the party.He sought to bring a new approach to leadership, adopting a less confrontational and more conversational tone at Prime Minister's Questions and generally refraining from either sound bites or photo opportunities - to the exasperation of what his supporters call the ""mainstream media"" and the derision of some commentators. The coalition behind Mr Corbyn held together for nine months, despite growing discontent among Labour MPs who had never wanted him as leader and could not accept either his style of leadership or his policies.The EU referendum brought things to a head. Corbyn, who had been a Eurosceptic as a backbencher, was accused of mounting a half-hearted campaign to keep Britain in the EU and of not appearing to care too much that his side had lost.Labour MPs, some of whom had been plotting to topple Corbyn at some point, saw this as the chance to make their move to try and force him to stand down, amid fears they would be wiped out at a snap election they expected to follow the referendum with him as leader.He faced a mass walkout from the shadow cabinet and then a vote of no confidence, which he lost by 172 votes to 40, as Labour MPs - enemies and previously loyal shadow ministers alike - urged him to quit.He refused to budge, pointing to the huge mandate he had received from Labour members and arguing that he had done better than many had expected in the electoral tests he had faced since becoming leader.MPs selected Owen Smith, a former member of his shadow cabinet who claimed to share the same left wing values, to take him on in another leadership election.So Jeremy Corbyn, the reluctant leader who had to be persuaded to stand in 2015, now found himself fighting to hold on to a position he never expected to hold, this time as favourite rather than as outsider. And, back on the campaign trail among his own supporters, he seemed to rather enjoy himself. As was the case a year earlier, thousands of people flocked to hear Mr Corbyn speak at rallies across the country  - 10,000 turned up at a single event in Liverpool - as he sought to tap directly into grassroots support for his message as a counterweight to the perceived hostility of the ""mainstream media"". In an unconventional campaign which saw him endorsed by UB40 but vilified by JK Rowling, the only genuine moment of discomfort came during ""traingate"" - when his claims that a train was so ""ram-packed"" that he had to sit on the floor came into question after Virgin Trains released footage showing him passing empty seats.Mr Corbyn's re-election has strengthened his position, with signs some of his critics are willing to serve under him again despite their differences.But it remains to be seen whether his commitment to reach out to his opponents and focus squarely on winning the next election will act as springboard to a new phase of his leadership or prove only a temporary respite in what some have said is an existential battle for control of the party.

2017-02-01,And we're off,https://web.archive.org//web/20170202115814/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38830552,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkIt's begun. After decades of debate, years of acrimony over the issue in the Conservative Party, months of brutal brinksmanship in Westminster, and hours of debate this week, MPs have just approved the very first step in the process of Britain leaving the European Union. There are many hurdles ahead, probably thousands of hours of debate here, years of negotiations for Theresa May with our friends and rivals around the EU, as she seeks a deal - and possibly as long as a decade of administrative adjustments, as the country extricates itself from the EU. On a wet Wednesday, the debate didn't feel epoch-making, but think for a moment about what has just happened. MPs, most of whom wanted to stay in the EU, have just agreed that we are off.  This time last year few in Westminster really thought that this would happen. The then prime minister's concern was persuading the rest of the EU to give him a better deal for the UK. His close colleagues believed the chances of them losing, let alone the government dissolving over the referendum, were slim, if not quite zero.Then tonight, his former colleagues are rubber stamping the decision of a narrow majority of the public, that changed everything in politics here for good. This isn't even the  last vote on this bill. There are several more stages, the Lords are likely to kick up rough at the start. But after tonight, for better or worse, few will believe that our journey to the exit door can be halted.As government ministers have said in recent days, the moment for turning back is past. "
2017-02-01,Brexit debate notes,https://web.archive.org//web/20170202115814/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-parliaments-38833310,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkI've got five take-outs from the Article 50 bill so far.There may be 101 pages of amendments down so far, but the government is in no mood to take any of them on board; on the contrary, their aim is to repel boarders, to the point where they would even resist the one amendment being mooted by the Brexiteer camp, which would aim to forbid ministers from accepting any extra time to extend the two year negotiating window specified by the EU's Lisbon Treaty. Ministers do believe that the EU's Michel Barnier's strategy is to enmesh the UK in a long-term negotiating limbo, perhaps including a post-Brexit transitional deal, but they don't want their hands tied.Many of the amendments, thus far, look like the product of an amendment generating bot, standard stuff about laying reports and regular debates. But ministers are wary of some of the substantive ones setting conditions - and in particular of the emotive issue of EU nationals resident in Britain, a matter now featuring regularly in most MPs' constituency surgeries. There is strong pressure for some kind of unilateral move for the UK to guarantee their right to remain - but, the government retorts, if that was passed, its backers would be to blame if one or two European states didn't reciprocate and allow UK nationals to stay within their borders.In the debate, Labour's frontbench Brexit spokesman, Sir Keir Starmer, looked and sounded like a lawyer delivering a plea in mitigation on behalf of a convicted prisoner. Early in his speech, he appealed to the Commons for a courteous hearing - something his opposite number, David Davis, would never have got away with. It just about worked, because the House genuinely wanted to hear what he had to say, but he does suffer from the lawyer-turned politician's tendency to address MPs as if they were the Court of Appeal. But leaving aside the style points, forging a line on Brexit which can stitch together the strongly pro-Brexit and strongly pro-Remain elements of Labour's heartland, let alone unify the deeply divided Parliamentary Labour Party, may prove an impossible challenge.Whether it's in the leadership ratings in Conservative Home, where he has now edged ahead of the prime minister herself, or in the growls of approval from his colleagues in the regular statements in the chamber, the Brexit Secretary, David Davis, increasingly commands the status of second minister in this government. This is not a wholly comfortable place to be - flying perilously near to the Sun - but as someone reconciled, not that long ago, to seeing out their parliamentary career on the backbenches, I suspect Mr Davis can bear it. The Lib Dems have sought to position themselves as the last champions of the Remain cause (although two of their MPs, Norman Lamb and Greg Mulholland have promised to abstain on the Article 50 Bill). But they can't claim to be the arch-opponents of Brexit and fail to maintain a presence for the big debates on it - and their leader, Tim Farron, had a chastening time at PMQs when this was pointed out. In truth, their much-reduced parliamentary party has been pretty bad at showing the flag, since the last election. It's rare to see all nine Lib Dem MPs on the green benches. This is one area where they are not very good at remaining. "

The House of Commons says: ""All petitions are checked for fraudulent activity, using both automated and manual checks. The checks prevent fraudulent signatures being added to petitions by individuals trying to repeatedly sign, or automated attacks (bots).""It adds that there is a balance to be made between making it easy for people to sign while making it harder to do so repeatedly.The procedures have been tightened up since last June, when at least 77,000 fraudulent signatures were removed from a petition calling for a second EU referendum.An investigation was launched after posts were found on websites from people claiming to have written programs that would automatically sign the petition thousands of times.The House of Commons will not give details of either the original or new security procedures it has put in place.It is not immediately obvious how the system works to prevent people voting more than once, but fraudulent signatures have been disqualified in the past. It should be said that both petitions have received considerably more than the 100,000 signatures, above which petitions ""almost always"" trigger a debate in Parliament.Read more from Reality Check"
2017-02-01,State visit politics,https://web.archive.org//web/20170202115814/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-38808647,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkA state visit is the ultimate weapon of British diplomacy, the bunker buster of soft power that can break down the hardest of tyrannical hearts. Few world leaders can resist the siren lure of all that royal bling: horse-drawn coaches, state banquets, processions down the Mall, the sheer scale of all that gold leaf and pomp and flummery that allows them a brief window into a royal fantasy that many countries envy but can rarely match. This weapon is deployed sparingly, normally no more than twice a year. But it does get used. If Donald Trump does touch down for a little red carpet treatment later this year, it will be the 110th time the Queen has welcomed another head of state to these shores in her reign. And for now, despite the protests and growing online petition, Downing Street is continuing to stand firm, insisting that the invitation to the president stands.So state visits are not merely ceremonial affairs, they are political and purposeful. They are used by the British government of the day to further what they see as Britain's national interests. In 1973, the Queen welcomed President Mobutu of what was then called Zaire in Africa, now the Democratic Republic of Congo. He was a brutal, corrupt dictator but he was also seen as a vital anti-communist ally in the Cold War against the Soviet Union. So he got an invite to the Palace. President Suharto of Indonesia, another repressive leader who happened to be anti-communist, was also granted a state visit in 1979 for the same reasons.In 1971, Emperor Hirohito of Japan was welcomed by the Queen for a state visit as a deliberate attempt to help usher the country back into the family of nations after its post-war isolation. Not surprisingly, the invitation of the man who had led Japan during World War Two was hugely controversial, and many former army veterans and prisoners of war turned their backs on the royal procession in silent protest. Some wore red gloves to symbolise the blood they saw as being on his hands while others whistled ribald old army tunes. A tree the Emperor had planted was uprooted.In 1978, Nicolae Ceausescu, the notorious Romanian communist leader, and his wife Elena were given a state visit in the vain hope that they might be encouraged to introduce some pro-Western reforms. The Queen was so repulsed by them that, according to the royal author Robert Hardman, while out walking her dogs, she hid behind a bush in the Palace gardens to avoid bumping into the couple who were also out strolling. More than a decade later both Ceausescu and his wife were executed by a revolutionary firing squad.And even the most uncontroversial of state visits, that of President Mandela in 1996, was not without political purpose. There was a feeling in the Foreign Office that South Africa was beginning to slip away from the West towards the unaligned nations, and they wanted to hug Madiba close and remind his country of Britain's anti-apartheid credentials.More recently, in 2014, the state visit of the Irish president to Britain was used as another step of reconciliation. Martin McGuiness, the former Northern Ireland deputy first minister and former IRA leader, not only put on white tie and tails for a state banquet at Windsor Castle, but he also stood for a toast to the Queen. And the state visit of President Xi in 2015 was a deliberate attempt by George Osborne, the then Chancellor, to curry favour with the Chinese and boost British trade links.As for American presidents, only two have been granted full state visits during the current Queen's reign: President Bush in 2003 and President Obama in 2011.What is unusual is the speed with which Mr Trump has been issued with an invitation for a state visit, just days into his presidency. Both Messrs Bush and Obama had to wait until well into their terms of office before they got the call. The haste reflects the importance the prime minister places on securing a good relationship with the new president and winning a post-Brexit trade deal, even if there is some political cost. Mr Bush's visit was by no means uncontroversial, coming so soon after the beginning of the Iraq war. There were demonstrations throughout the trip, including one involving tens of thousands in central London when an effigy of the president was toppled over in a parody of events in Baghdad. So the Queen may be above politics but state visits are not. They are used for diplomacy and are often controversial. And whatever protests may surround any Trump state visit, the Queen will have seen it all before. Rarely has she shown herself unable to cope with whomsoever the government brings round for tea. As one royal insider told me dryly: ""She does have some experience in these matters.""Or as former foreign secretary William Hague wrote more bluntly in the Telegraph this morning, ""A Queen who has been asked over the decades to host tyrants such as Presidents Mobutu of Zaire and Ceausescu of Romania is going to take a brash billionaire from New York effortlessly in her stride.""

A paltry 50% bothered to vote in the constituency at the general election.If UKIP can get out the leavers they can win, or so goes the theory. As it happens both the Labour and Conservative candidates voted Remain at the referendum.Labour's man Gareth Snell even published a rude poem on Twitter about Brexit's flaws. To add to the fun, he has been just as rude about Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell on Twitter.When I ask him if Labour's leader would make a good prime minister he gives an unusually nuanced answer for a candidate: ""Jeremy is the leader of our party. I will campaign for whoever the leader of our party is to be prime minister. ""If that's Jeremy I'll do all I can to make sure he steps through the door of 10 Downing Street.""A UKIP victory here would make good the long-held theory of party leader and candidate Paul Nuttall that his party can defeat Labour in parliamentary elections.Winning a seat at Westminster for himself would also see him triumph where his predecessor Nigel Farage failed. No wonder there's a glint in his eye.The idea of a UKIP win fits the key themes of the moment: Labour struggling, opposition to mainstream parties thriving. But that's why we should be cautious.Let's start with a confession: by-election speculation is grounded on even fewer facts than chatter about national politics. Rather than having those national polls about which we're so sceptical, we have no worthwhile polling at all.Candidates reporting the universally warm reception they have received on the doorstep are taking part in a grand tradition, but offering no evidence.UKIP's performance in by-elections since 2015 has been underwhelming; their best result in a parliamentary contest was a 3% improvement in their vote in Oldham West.In council by elections since September they've held one seat and made one gain from Labour, lost two to the Conservatives and one to the Lib Dems. It's not much of a surge.While the Conservatives are thought to have a much better chance in the by-election in Copeland, they ran UKIP close in Stoke in 2015.Their candidate Jack Brereton sticks with unerring consistency to a handful of talking points, brooking little deviation and plenty of repetition.Why did he vote to remain at the referendum? ""I voted Remain and I've been open and honest about that because - um - but we need to get beyond that, it's about now delivering Brexit,"" he answers.If it's a maddening (for an interviewer) habit to acquire aged 25 it's also the habit of someone who has already become a Tory council cabinet member in a Labour area.Labour's Snell meanwhile is a borough councillor, and argues that while local voters are concerned about Brexit they want to know what plan the prime minister has for jobs and investment in Stoke. On this topic he sounds more sure-footed.UKIP's Nuttall is frank about his tactics. He says: ""If we turn this into a referendum on Brexit we win this seat. It really is as simple as that. The Liberal Democrats did it in Richmond which is a big Remain seat. If we do the same we're in with a really good chance.""Those Liberal Democrats are making their play for the 30% of the vote that rejected Brexit and could woo Labour voters unconvinced by Corbyn, although their candidate Dr Zulfiqar Ali saw his vote plunge 17.5% at the last general election.Bizarrely, in the right places UKIP and the Lib Dems share a strategy - trying to fight out the referendum again on opposing sides and playing to the passions of the politics it left in its wake. UKIP have money - privately they expect to hit the spending limit - and seem to be better organised in Stoke than in other recent contests. The idea that they can use this moment to prise Labour's traditional support away certainly rattles many in Corbyn's party.Shadow cabinet members talk grimly about the idea many voters now identify more with people who vote as they did at the referendum than with those who voted like them at the general election.A compelling fight in Stoke-on-Trent then, but one in its earliest stages. Anyone forecasting the outcome with certainty is placing great store by precedent, doorstep sentiment or hunch.The nomination deadline is 16:00 BST on 31 January.Here is a list of the candidates declared so far:"

This is because cities tend to have one council but several Westminster constituencies.This means in most cases we cannot say exactly how each parliamentary constituency voted.  However, Chris Hanretty, an academic at the University of East Anglia, has used the results for local authorities to make detailed estimates for each constituency.These are based on other things we know about the area, such as age, education, ethnicity and income, and how strongly those factors correlate with a vote for Brexit in the places where we know the vote at constituency level for sure.Mr Hanretty estimates that most constituencies where Remain support was the highest did indeed vote Labour in 2015, although Glasgow North and Edinburgh North, both represented by the SNP, are exceptions.But that's not the picture in the areas that most passionately backed Leave.The Brexit vote was strongest in parts of eastern England, especially Lincolnshire, which backed the Conservatives in 2015.Mr Hanretty estimates that Conservative-held Boston and Skegness was the constituency with the highest Leave vote.It covers the Boston council area, which recorded the strongest vote to leave the EU of any local authority, and part of East Lindsey, another overwhelmingly pro-Brexit area.It's true that some places where Leave support was strongest voted Labour in 2015, such as Doncaster North, Ed Miliband's constituency. But the Leave vote was highest in Conservative parts of eastern England.Read more from Reality Check"

2017-02-01,Meet the EU's chief Brexit negotiator,https://web.archive.org//web/20170202115814/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37542204,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe British papers love a French villain at the heart of the EU.Is Michel Barnier about to succeed Jacques Delors as the object of their affection? The veteran Gaullist already has form.When he was Commissioner for the Internal Market and Financial Services, Mr Barnier was dubbed ""the most dangerous man in Europe"" after taking on the banking sector and championing a cap on bankers' bonuses. But while he alarmed some in the City, and will probably do so again, he also won grudging respect as a tough but even-handed negotiator.He will need all those skills and more in his new role - chief Brexit negotiator at the European Commission. And having moved seamlessly between big jobs in Paris and Brussels - French foreign minister, Commissioner, MEP - he looks well prepared. ""Don't ask me to tell you what will be at the end of the road, we haven't begun to walk yet,"" he told a conference in Brussels last month. Mr Barnier will stick closely to the official EU position of ""no negotiation without notification"" - waiting for the UK to trigger Article 50 to start the formal process of withdrawal. But he's clearly eager to get going.""I am waiting to begin,"" he said. ""I will be ready tomorrow to negotiate, frankly speaking.""And he will bring with him an instinctive pro-European agenda, and a deep knowledge of the workings of the single market.His deputy as chief Brexit negotiator is a German trade expert, Sabine Weyand, adding to the impression that Mr Barnier will lead a team that means business.One of the biggest challenges he (and his boss Jean-Claude Juncker) faces, is to ensure that representatives of the big member states don't sideline him in the Brexit divorce negotiations.But Mr Barnier's long career in French politics means he could well have the ear of the Elysee Palace, especially if - as looks likely - a centre-right candidate wins the French presidency next year. The stakes are so high that there are bound to be some clashes.Mr Barnier has sparred with the UK's Minister for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, before, when the men both served as Europe ministers in the 1990s. It is another reminder that Michel Barnier is a politician first and foremost, rather than a bureaucrat. There have certainly been criticisms - a dash of vanity, a lack of attention to detail. His career has had plenty of downs as well as ups.But he will defend his European vision to the end, and the British government would do well not to underestimate him.At the height of the eurozone crisis, Mr Barnier always refused (politely) to do broadcast interviews in English.""One wrong word,"" he told me once with a smile, ""and we could move markets.""The next few years will be equally challenging."

Scotland voted 62% in favour of Remain.The conversation online was being driven overwhelmingly by pro-independence campaigners. But people who had supported ""Better Together"" during the Scottish referendum vote also spoke about the possibility of a break-away from the UK as a result of the vote over EU membership.  Perhaps the most significant was Scottish author JK Rowling who tweeted: ""Scotland will seek independence now. Cameron's legacy will be breaking up two unions. Neither needed to happen.""Many took to Twitter to express new or strengthened pro-independence feelings in the wake of the latest vote (Just as a reminder: a ""Yes"" vote in Scotland's 2014 referendum was for independence, while the winning ""No"" campaign backed staying in the UK).One old tweet from 2014's independence referendum gained new life on Friday. Put out by the cross-party Better Together campaign, it reminded Scottish voters that the EU membership of an independent Scotland would be no sure thing:Blog by Mike WendlingNext story: Nigel Farage's wild nightAs the EU referendum vote swung decisively to Leave, perhaps nobody's fortunes changed more than UKIP leader Nigel Farage.

The bill will now face more debate before it can become law.MPs will discuss the bill in more detail next week when it reaches the committee stage in the Commons, and Labour has vowed to force through amendments.Hundreds of amendments have already been tabled for debate between Monday and Wednesday, with objectives set out in the government's strategy expected to attract more.Shadow cabinet members Rachael Maskell and Dawn Butler quit the party's front bench shortly before Wednesday evening's vote, and in total, 13 Labour frontbenchers voted against their own party position which was to support the bill.Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, shadow chancellor John McDonnell said other parties had also been divided on the issue, with two of the Liberal Democrats' nine MPs abstaining despite orders to oppose the bill.Mr McDonnell said a decision on whether frontbench rebels could remain in their jobs would be taken ""in due course"", and that the atmosphere in his party was ""one of mutual respect"", with determination to oppose a ""reckless Brexit"".He said Labour ""may look divided"" but would unite after the government triggers official negotiations under Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty while ""the Tory Party will split apart"".Sorry, your browser cannot display this content.Enter your postcode, or the name or constituency of your MPThe Brexit bill was published last week, after the Supreme Court decided MPs and peers must have a say before Article 50 could be triggered.It rejected the government's argument that Mrs May had sufficient powers to trigger Brexit without consulting Parliament.Iain Watson, BBC political correspondent, said a ""sizeable"" Labour rebellion could grow further if amendments were not passed.By Iain Watson, BBC political correspondentIn truth, the substance of the government's white paper will be similar to the speech the prime minister gave last month, setting out her priorities for the forthcoming negotiations with the EU.Only one Conservative MP - the former Chancellor Ken Clarke - voted against the principle of leaving the EU last night but some of his colleagues are more likely to defy their government on the detail.Labour, however, appears more divided. Three shadow cabinet members refused to support triggering Article 50 and stepped down before the vote. Jeremy Corbyn is yet to decide whether to discipline the 10 junior shadow ministers who rebelled, or indeed the three whips who were supposed to impose party discipline rather than flout it.With the possibility of two more shadow cabinet members going next week, Mr Corbyn will have to decide whether to relax his instruction not to block Brexit if Labour's amendments are defeated.The SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Liberal Democrats all opposed the government's bill, alongside Tory Ken Clarke.The SNP's foreign affairs spokesman at Westminster, Alex Salmond, said there would be ""detailed questions"" about the bill during its next stage.He said ""the calibre of the government will be judged by how they respond to the amendments"".Mr Clarke, the only Conservative MP to defy his party by voting against the bill, said the result was ""historic"", but the ""mood could change"" when the ""real action"" of negotiations with the EU starts.Mrs May has set a deadline of 31 March for invoking Article 50. Talks with the EU are expected to last up to two years, with the UK predicted to leave the 28-member organisation in 2019."

Last October, after years of delay, the government said that building a third runway at Heathrow was its preferred option for expanding airport capacity.Mr Grayling told the Commons that a third runway would generate tens of thousands of jobs, and be a major boost to the economy as Britain prepares to leave the European Union.  ""By backing the north-west runway at Heathrow airport and publishing our proposals, we are sending a clear signal that when we leave the EU, we are open for business,"" Mr Grayling said.With the government about to set out its strategy for withdrawal from the EU in a White Paper, Mr Grayling said that a third runway at Heathrow would enhance the UK's global links.""Leaving the EU is a new chapter for Britain and provides us with a great opportunity to forge a new role in the world. We are determined to seize that opportunity and having the right infrastructure in place will allow us to build a more global Britain,"" he told MPs.Alongside his announcement of a ""draft policy statement"" on Heathrow expansion, Mr Grayling also issued a consultation document on improving Britain's air space infrastructure and investing in new technology.He said it made sense to carry out the two consultations together, which will run until 25 May, with the final decisions going before Parliament late this year or early 2018.The consultations on Heathrow and air traffic facilities will involve events across the country ""because the whole country will benefit,"" Mr Grayling said. He is due in Glasgow later to expand on how travellers and freight users outside the south east England will benefit.The cost of a third runway is estimated to be £22bn, and is forecast to generate about 70,000 jobs. An additional 260,000 take-offs or landings would be permitted each year from the expanded airport, on top of the current cap of 480,000.The consultation will consider such things as pollution, additional rail and road infrastructure such a roads, and the impact on surrounding towns and villages. But there is expected to be continued significant opposition to the third runway proposal.Earlier, Liberal Democrat MP for Richmond Park and North Kingston, Sarah Olney, accused the government of being ""so desperate"" to reassure businesses about its Brexit plans that it is ""willing to steamroller over those communities opposed to Heathrow expansion"".And John Stewart, chairman of anti-Heathrow expansion group Hacan, said it was important that the government assessed the consultation ""in an even-handed way"" and rejected the plan if the expected impact on issues such as noise was found to be ""too great""."

It came after the UK defence secretary told BBC Scotland that the SNP should ""forget"" about holding a second referendum. But Sir Michael Fallon would not be drawn on reports he had suggested the UK government would block a vote.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon tweeted that Sir Michael had ""seriously backpedalled"" on the issue. A spokeswoman for Prime Minister Theresa May later said that the referendum in 2014, when Scotland voted by 55% to 45% to remain in the UK, was ""legal, fair and decisive"".She added: ""We believe that this issue was settled in 2014. Recent polls don't suggest that there has been a big change in the views around a second referendum.""The Scottish first minister has said another independence referendum was increasingly likely in the wake of the Brexit vote, but she would need the UK government's permission in order to hold a second legally binding vote.Speaking to BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme, Sir Michael said the SNP ""need to forget all that stuff and get on with what they were elected to do.""But he did not directly answer questions on whether or not the UK government would allow a vote. He said: ""We don't see the need for a referendum - this is a diversion. ""What the Scottish government should be focusing on is what it was elected to do, which is to improve schools standards, get to grips with the problems in Scottish hospitals and reverse the serious rise in unemployment.""The minister urged the SNP to focus on their ""day job"" and ""not get into the theology of whether or not a second referendum should be held"".The Herald newspaper said it had asked Sir Michael whether the UK government would facilitate a referendum during the lifetime of this parliament.It quoted the Conservative politician as replying: ""No, forget it. The respect agenda is two way.""She [Ms Sturgeon] is constantly asking us to respect the SNP government, but she has to respect the decision of the Scotland to stay inside the UK in 2014 and the decision of the UK to leave the EU.""Respect works both ways."" Sir Michael was speaking ahead of a visit to Midlothian engineering firm MacTaggart Scott designs, at which he said the Treasury had approved the initial business case for a training school for naval crews working on the UK's nuclear submarines.The submarine school would be built at the Faslane naval base on the Clyde, which will be home to all 11 Royal Navy submarines from 2020 in a move which will see the number of people employed there rise from 6,800 to 8,200.Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson opposes a second referendum being held - but said last year that she did not believe the UK government should block one. Ms Sturgeon tweeted that there had been ""serious backpedalling from Michael Fallon on GMS on blocking #indyref2. Must have realised what a disastrous move it would be for Tories.""She later told Holyrood: ""If this parliament voted to have a referendum on independence, then absolutely I agree that no Westminster Tory should stand in the way of the voice of this parliament.""The mandate of this government in relation to this is unequivocal - it was the Tories after all who put us in the position of being taken out of the European Union against our will, and with the support of only one of the 59 MPs in this country.""Strange is it not that a Tory party that proclaims that it would be so confident of winning a referendum on independence now talks about trying to block it. ""Isn't it the case that the Tories are actually running a wee bit feart?"" "
2017-02-02,SNP and Greens strike Scots budget deal,https://web.archive.org//web/20170202115814/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-38828873,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe Scottish budget has been voted through the first stage of the legislative process after a deal between the SNP and Greens.MSPs backed Finance Secretary Derek Mackay's tax and spending plans by a margin of 67 to 59.A deal was struck with the Greens totalling £220m of extra spending, including £160m for local authorities.The deal will also see the threshold for the 40p rate of income tax frozen at £43,000.The same threshold is being raised to £45,000 in the rest of the UK, so the move means higher-rate tax payers elsewhere will pay up to £400 less tax every year than people earning the same wage in Scotland. The Scottish government had originally planned to raise the threshold only by the rate of inflation.Green co-convener Patrick Harvie told MSPs that his party had secured ""the biggest budget compromise in the history of devolution in Scotland"".Speaking at First Minister's Questions, Nicola Sturgeon said her priority was not to cut taxes for the top 10% earning Scottish taxpayers.But Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson accused Ms Sturgeon of setting out to make Scotland the highest taxed part of the UK.Previous votes on the budget proposals and on taxation had failed to find any consensus between the parties.However Mr Mackay confirmed on Thursday morning that a deal had been struck with the Greens, centred around £160m of extra funding for the core council grant.It will also see £25m extra for the police reform budget and £35m for Scottish Enterprise, and a freezing of the higher 40p rate of tax at £43,000. The threshold for this rate in the rest of the UK is to rise to £45,000.Mr Mackay said this would only affect 10% of the population, who would end up paying more tax than people earning the same amount in the rest of the UK. He said the ""income forgone amounts to £7.70 a week - less than the cost of a prescription in England"".356,00Approximate total number13%Working population£43,000 Start of 40p tax rate (2016/ 17) £43,430 Start of 40p tax rate (2017/18) £7.70 Value of inflation rise per week Mr Mackay said: ""I entered into discussions with all parties in good faith in order to build the consensus we need to deliver a budget for Scotland. I particularly welcome the constructive approach taken by the Scottish Greens.""My latest assessment of the financial position this year and our projections for 2017/18 has enabled me to identify available resources to support additional spending. ""I therefore propose, with the support of the Scottish Green party for all stages of this budget to allocate additional resources, of £160m, to local government to be spent at the discretion of individual authorities.""Once again this government has listened and acted.""Challenged about the deal by Labour's Kezia Dugdale, Mr Harvie said he believed the Scottish government had ""given far less ground than I think they could on taxation"".But he added: ""The reality though is £160m additional [funding] going into the un-ringfenced local government allocation.""The fact that the Scottish government found this money in other ways [than taxation] is not what I would have wished.""This is not a budget I would have written, but nobody who cares about protecting public services in Scotland can look at that extra £160m investment and say, no thanks, I'd rather just keep ranting and make no difference in people's lives.""Mr Harvie was attacked by other opposition leaders from across the chamber.Ms Dugdale said:  ""To accept anything less than bold use of this parliament's tax powers is an astonishing and deeply disappointing revelation from the Greens.""And let's not kid ourselves. This isn't the Greens' responsibility to parliament shining through, it's the responsibility they have put on themselves to do nothing which might jeopardise the prospect of another divisive independence referendum.""This is the truth - nationalism first, austerity second, and somewhere down the list of credentials you might just find the environment.""Ms Dugdale said this be remembered as the day the Greens ""abandoned any claim to be a party of the progressive left"".Tory MSP Murdo Fraser meanwhile accused the SNP front bench of ""swallowing hook, line and sinker the Green Party's hard-left, high-tax agenda"".He said: ""They have let Patrick Harvie pull all the strings and it will be hard working Scottish families that suffer as a consequence.""The finance secretary had a choice going into today's debate. He could have come with us, drop his plans to make Scotland the highest taxed part of the United Kingdom and work together with us to deliver an ambitious Budget focused on growing the economy.""Or he could turn sharp left and embrace the anti-growth, anti-business agenda of the Green Party. What a pity, what a tragedy for Scotland that he chose to throw in his lot with the lentil-munching, sandal-wearing watermelons on that side of the chamber.""The Lib Dems had asked for up to £400m in spending commitments for mental health, education, policing and transport, but later indicated that ""the distance is too great"" between the parties.The party's leader, Willie Rennie, said the Greens had abandoned earlier pledges about a ""greener, bolder"" Holyrood and were now backing a ""timorous and grey deal"".He said the SNP had ""turned down an opportunity"" to do a deal with the Lib Dems, which he said would have seen millions invested in education and mental health.He said: ""All of that has been turned down today in pursuit of an agenda that was contrary to what they promised that they would deliver.""So I think the SNP have missed a big opportunity. I think they are hollow with their promises and we will cast a harsher eye over them in future years when they promise to make a big change to Scottish society.""With the general principles of the bill now approved by members, it will move on to be debated at committee level.Stage three would see separate votes on tax and spending proposals in the chamber in the week beginning 20 February. Mr Mackay confirmed a deal had been agreed for ""all stages""."

So it seems to me an absurd argument."""

""They used to keep it under the ground. Now they're coming out. A lid has been lifted off.""The CST, which has recorded data since 1984, said a perceived increase in racism and xenophobia following the EU referendum and greater discussion of anti-Semitism in the Labour Party could explain the rise.Ms Rudd described anti-Semitism as a ""deplorable form of hatred"".She said: ""It is vital we ensure the safety and security of our Jewish community and this government will continue to do all we can to stamp out these vile attacks and encourage those who experience them to come forward.""Communities Secretary Sajid Javid added: ""Anti-Semitism must be understood for what it is - an attack on the identity of people who live, contribute and are valued in our society.Last year Labour held an inquiry into allegations of anti-Semitism in the party, following the suspension of MP Naz Shah and ex-London mayor Ken Livingstone.Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson said the findings of the report were ""extremely distressing"", adding: ""We must root out anti-Semitism whenever it takes place and wherever it exists, as a party and as a country."""

He said the affair was not just a judicial matter but an ethical and moral one, and an urgent decision had to be made.Recently the favourite to win the presidency in elections in April and May, he has now slipped behind Ms Le Pen and centrist Emmanuel Macron. Mr Fillon said he would fight the accusations ""to the end"" on Wednesday but commentators suggested his fate was slipping out of his hands.Socialist candidate Benoit Hamon ridiculed the idea of a left-wing coup, saying it was ""a bit curious to search for plots where there aren't any"".Francois Fillon's chances of political survival are hanging on a thread, and if you want to know why just listen to French talk radio.This morning on RMC when broadcaster Jean-Jacques Bourdin took calls about Penelopegate, the mood was angry.Caller after caller pointed up the vast difference in their own salary, and the money - up to €10,000 ($10,800; £8,540) a month - which Penelope Fillon took as her husband's parliamentary assistant. ""And I actually work!"" said one.And in the Republican Party, what was unthinkable a few days ago is now outwardly mooted: that Francois Fillon may need to step down and be replaced.Read more from Hugh: Can Fillon survive? And more on this story:TV news channels in France were running constant coverage of Mr Fillon's plight, which began a week ago with an expose in satirical weekly Le Canard Enchaine and has become the main story in the campaign.The newspaper alleged on Tuesday that Penelope Fillon had been paid €830,000 (£710,000; $900,000) for working as a parliamentary aide first to her husband and then to his replacement as MP, Marc Joulaud, far more than it had originally claimed.That was on top of the €100,000 that it says she was paid by a literary review owned by a wealthy friend of her husband called Marc Ladreit de Lacharriere.

The bill returns to the Commons next week.MPs held two days of debate on the bill, which follows last June's referendum in which voters opted by 51.9% to 48.1% in favour of Brexit.Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, a leading Leave campaigner, called the Commons result ""absolutely momentous"". Speaking on Facebook, he added: ""We may be leaving the EU treaties. We are not leaving Europe.""The UK would ""forge a new identity"" and make ""an amazingly positive contribution"" to Europe, he said.By Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editorThis time last year few in Westminster really thought that this would happen. The then prime minister's concern was persuading the rest of the EU to give him a better deal for the UK. His close colleagues believed the chances of them losing, let alone the government dissolving over the referendum, were slim, if not quite zero.This isn't even the last vote on this bill. There are several more stages, the Lords are likely to kick up rough at the start. But after tonight, for better or worse, few will believe that our journey to the exit door can be halted.Read Laura's blogSorry, your browser cannot display this content.Enter your postcode, or the name or constituency of your MPLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn had imposed a three-line whip - the strongest sanction at his disposal - on his MPs to back the bill.Shadow cabinet members Rachael Maskell and Dawn Butler quit the party's front bench shortly before the vote, in order to defy his orders.Also, 13 Labour frontbenchers voted against their own party position, apparently without first resigning.Mr Corbyn said: ""Labour MPs voted more than three to one in favour of triggering Article 50. Now the battle of the week ahead is to shape Brexit negotiations to put jobs, living standards and accountability centre stage.""Labour's amendments are the real agenda. The challenge is for MPs of all parties to ensure the best deal for Britain, and that doesn't mean giving Theresa May a free hand to turn Britain into a bargain-basement tax haven.""One MP was heard to shout ""Suicide"" when the result of the vote was announced.Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron, seven of whose nine MPs voted against the government, said: ""The Tories and Labour have failed future generations today by supporting a hard Brexit.""Labour's leadership tonight have waved the white flag. They are not an opposition; they are cheerleaders.""MPs will discuss the bill in more detail next week when it reaches its committee stage in the Commons, during which amendments to the government's plans will be discussed.The SNP's foreign affairs spokesman at Westminster, Alex Salmond, said: ""Next week there will be detailed questions and the calibre of the government will be judged by how they respond to the amendments.""Plaid Cymru's Westminster group leader, Hywel Williams, called Labour's stance ""deeply disappointing"", adding: ""This was not a vote on whether to accept the referendum result. It was a vote on whether to endorse the Tories' extreme version of Brexit.""Ken Clarke, the only Conservative MP to defy his party by voting against the bill, said the result was ""historic"", but the ""mood could change"" when the ""real action"" of negotiations with the EU starts.Earlier, the Commons voted against an SNP amendment aimed at scuppering the bill.The bill was published last week, after the Supreme Court decided MPs and peers must have a say before Article 50 could be triggered.It rejected the government's argument that Mrs May had sufficient powers to trigger Brexit without consulting Parliament.Talks with the EU are expected to last up to two years, with the UK predicted to leave the 28-member organisation in 2019."

2017-02-02,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20170202115814/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThis article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide to the UK's vote to leave the European Union. It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 52% to 48%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%, as did Wales, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who resigned on the day after losing the referendum. Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she says she will respect the will of the people. She has said ""Brexit means Brexit"" but there is still a lot of debate about what that will mean in practice especially on the two key issues of how British firms do business in the European Union and what curbs are brought in on the rights of European Union nationals to live and work in the UK. She set out more details of her negotiating hopes in her key speech on Brexit.The UK economy appears to have weathered the initial shock of the Brexit vote, although the value of the pound remains near a 30-year low, but opinion is sharply divided over the long-term effects of leaving the EU. Some major firms such as Easyjet and John Lewis have pointed out that the slump in sterling has increased their costs. Britain also lost its top AAA credit rating, meaning the cost of government borrowing will be higher. But share prices have recovered from a dramatic slump in value, with both the FTSE 100 and the broader FTSE 250 index, which includes more British-based businesses, trading higher than before the referendum. The Bank of England cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - a record low and the first cut since 2009 - after the vote and there has not been the economic slump or recession that some had predicted. Here is a regularly updated detailed rundown of how Britain's economy is doingThe European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it has to invoke an agreement called Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May has said she intends to trigger this process by the end of March 2017, meaning the UK will be expected to have left by the summer of 2019, depending on the precise timetable agreed during the negotiations. The government will also enact a Great Repeal Bill which will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. It is expected to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove.After a court battle, the UK's Supreme Court has ruled that Parliament must be consulted before Article 50 is invoked. This is why a two line Brexit bill is currently making its way through Parliament. MPs and Lords have to vote on it.The court verdict was not what the government argued for, but ministers have insisted it will not delay their planned timetable.Most MPs are expected to vote in favour of Article 50 being triggered, although there could be attempts to amend the draft legislation.Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These men - dubbed the Three Brexiteers - will play a central role in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although it will be Mrs May, as prime minister, who will have the final say. The government did not do any emergency planning for Brexit ahead of the referendum and Mrs May has rejected calls to say what her negotiating goals are.Once Article 50 has been triggered, the UK will have two years to negotiate its withdrawal. But no one really knows how the Brexit process will work - Article 50 was only created in late 2009 and it has never been used. Former Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, now Chancellor, wanted Britain to remain in the EU, and he has suggested it could take up to six years for the UK to complete exit negotiations. The terms of Britain's exit will have to be agreed by 27 national parliaments, a process which could take some years, he has argued. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. The UK will continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making.Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Following Theresa May's Brexit recent speech we now know that the UK is not intending to stay in the EU's single market. Although there has been speculation for months about the issue, it would have meant the UK staying under the auspices of the European Court of Justice and having to allow unlimited EU immigration, under freedom of movement rules.Both sides want trade to continue after Brexit with the UK seeking a positive outcome for those who wish to trade goods and services"" - such as those in the City of London and wanting a ""comprehensive free trade deal"" giving the UK ""the greatest possible access"" to the single market. Mrs May says she wants the UK to reach a new customs union deal with the EU. A customs union is where countries agree not to impose tariffs on each others' goods and have a common tariff on goods coming in from elsewhere. The UK is currently part of the EU customs union but that stops the UK being able to do its own trade deals with other countries. Reality Check: How could customs union work?These terms have increasingly been used as debate focused on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people in order to maintain access to the EU single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result.The government has declined to give a firm guarantee about the status of EU nationals currently living in the UK, saying this is not possible without a reciprocal pledge from other EU members about the millions of British nationals living on the continent. EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, will be be able to stay, the chief civil servant at the Home Office has said. The rights of other EU nationals would be subject to negotiations on Brexit and the ""will of Parliament"", he added.A lot depends on the kind of deal the UK agrees with the EU. If it remains within the single market, it would almost certainly retain free movement rights, allowing UK citizens to work in the EU and vice versa. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.Again, it depends on whether the UK government decides to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages. Citizens' Advice has reminded people their rights have not changed yet and asked anyone to contact them if they think they have been discriminated against following the Leave vote.Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested EU migrants who come to the UK as Brexit nears may not be given the right to stay. He has said there might have to be a cut-off point if there was a ""surge"" in new arrivals.People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote.The day-to-day spending impact is likely to be more significant. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it to remain at least 10% below where it was on 23 June, in the long term. This means imported goods will consequently get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have already been seen and the issue was most notably illustrated by the dispute between Tesco and Marmite's makers about whether prices would be put up or not in the stores.The latest UK inflation figures, for December, showed the CPI inflation rate jumping to 1.6%, its highest level for two years with signs of more cost pressures set to feed through in the months to come.Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration.She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations. As mentioned above, the key issue is whether other EU nations will grant the UK access to the single market, if that is what it wants, while at the same time being allowed to restrict the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK.Mrs May has said she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. It is currently running at 330,000 a year, of which 184,000 are EU citizens, and 188,000 are from outside the EU - the figures include a 39,000 outflow of UK citizens.It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Liberal Democrats - who have just a handful of MPs - have vowed to halt Brexit and keep Britain in the EU if they were to win the next general election.Some commentators, including former House of Commons clerk Lord Lisvane, have argued that a further referendum would be needed to ratify whatever deal the UK hammers out with the EU, but there are few signs political leaders view this as a viable option.Yes. Theresa May has appeared keen to avoid a vote on her negotiating stance, to avoid having to give away her priorities, but Theresa May has said there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. It is worth mentioning that any deal also has to be agreed by the European Parliament - with British MEPs getting a chance to vote on it there.  While there could be limitations on British nationals' ability to live and work in EU countries, it seems unlikely they would want to deter tourists. There are many countries outside the European Economic Area, which includes the 28 EU nations plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway, that British citizens can visit for up to 90 days without needing a visa and it is possible that such arrangements could be negotiated with European countries.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. In theory, the government could, if it wanted, decide to change the colour, which is currently standardised for EU countries, says the BBC's Europe correspondent, Chris Morris.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketNo nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it is ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faces being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. A second independence referendum for the country is now ""highly likely"", she has said, although not in 2017. She has said she wants Scotland to stay in the single market and said Mrs May's decision to rule out the UK staying in the single market ""undoubtedly"" brings the referendum closer.Before his resignation Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said the impact in Northern Ireland would be ""very profound"" and that the whole island of Ireland should now be able to vote on reunification. But, speaking while she was still Northern Ireland Secretary, Theresa Villiers ruled out the call from Sinn Féin for a border poll, saying the circumstances in which one would be called did not exist. The land border is likely to be a key part of the Brexit talks. Theresa May said a priority for her would be negotiating a deal with the EU which allowed a common travel area between the UK and the Republic of Ireland.During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest. But his successor Theresa May has said she will keep it in place, at least for the current Parliament, which is due to last until 2020.So far there has been a cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. There are yet to be signs that rising inflation have worried the Bank of England  enough to consider raising interest rates.  But if that happened it would make mortgages and loans more expensive to repay - but would be good news for savers.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.Eurotunnel boss Jacques Gounon said last November the reintroduction of duty-free would be ""an incredible boost for my business"" but he later said  that remark had been ""light-hearted"". Erik Juul-Mortensen, president of the Tax Free World Association (TFWA) said after the referendum vote ""it is not possible to predict how Brexit will affect the duty free and travel retail industry, and it is wiser not to make assumptions about exactly what the impact will be.""  They are at the moment but no-one knows the longer term prospects for definite. The EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - is not an EU initiative. It was negotiated between countries within a group known as the European Economic Area, often simply referred to as the single market (plus Switzerland, which confusingly is not a member of the EEA, but has agreed access to the single market). Therefore, the future of Britons' EHIC cover could depend on whether the UK decided to sever ties with the EEA.Probably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report. In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two-thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.However, the UK government is committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, the UK government is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR. However, the EU has its own European Court of Justice, whose decisions are binding on EU institutions and member states.Its rulings have sometimes caused controversy in Britain and supporters of a Brexit have called for immediate legislation to curb its powers. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also cited sovereignty and democracy, and they wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Four of the biggest US banks have committed to helping maintain the City's position. But HSBC will move up to 1,000 jobs to Paris, the BBC understands. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Pest control firm Rentokil Initial says it could make £15m extra this year thanks to a weaker currency.Others are less optimistic. Hilary Jones, a director at UK cosmetics firm Lush said the company was ""terrified"" about the economic impact. She added that while the firm's Dorset factory would continue to produce goods for the UK market, products for the European market may be made at its new plant in Germany.Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After the Leave vote, the government will probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""As with most elements of the UK economy, not enough solid data has been published yet to accurately conclude the Brexit effect on house prices. Industry figures have pointed to ""uncertainty"" among buyers and sellers that could potentially change the housing market.So far, the most significant research has come from the respected Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which has published the conclusions of a survey of its members. This primarily records sentiment among surveyors.It found that house prices are expected to fall across the UK in the three months after the referendum vote. However, the dip in prices is only expected to persist over the 12 months from June in London and East Anglia, surveyors predict.House prices were already slowing in central London, owing to the fall-out from changes to stamp duty rules in April.Separate figures from property portal Rightmove suggested the average asking price of houses coming on to the market in England and Wales fell by 0.9%, or £2,647, in July compared with June. It said that agents had reported very few sales had fallen through as a result of the vote.Many potential first-time buyers would welcome a fall in house prices, with ownership among the young falling owing to affordability concerns. Investors in property, or those who have paid off a mortgage and hope to leave homes as inheritance would be unhappy with a long-term reduction in value.  Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law following the decision to leave the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" will not necessarily disappear overnight - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU means the UK will not be part of TTIP. It will have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Former Labour health secretary Lord Owen has said that because of TTIP (see answer above) the only way to protect the NHS from further privatisation was to get out of the EU."
2017-02-02,Who's Who: Theresa May's cabinet,https://web.archive.org//web/20170202115814/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36785814,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkTheresa May is forming her new government after becoming Conservative prime minister. She is continuing to announce her full cabinet - but here's what we know so far. The list will be updated as new appointments are made. Campaigned to Remain in the European Union The former home secretary, 59, becomes the UK's second female prime minister in the wake of David Cameron's resignation after the EU referendum. She had previously served in the Home Office for more than six years. Theresa May: Full profileHow does May's cabinet compare to Cameron's?Campaigned to Leave the EUBoris Johnson succeeds Philip Hammond at the Foreign Office. The former London mayor headed the campaign for the UK to leave the European Union. He did not previously have a ministerial appointment in Mr Cameron's government but accepted an invitation to attend political cabinet. He was not running any department. Mr Johnson, 52, may be one of the best known politicians in the country but the move to foreign secretary is a big step up from his previous role.Read how the world has reacted.Leave campaignerDavid Davis has been appointed to the new cabinet position of secretary of state for exiting the European Union - or ""Brexit secretary"". A veteran Eurosceptic, he has previously held the positions of Conservative party chairman and shadow deputy prime minister. Between 2003 and 2008, he was the shadow home secretary under both Michael Howard and David Cameron. Mr Davis, 67, lost to David Cameron in the 2005 Tory leadership contest. Details about the new Brexit department are still emerging, but it is likely to take the lead in negotiating Britain's departure from the EU and unpicking the thousands of pages of EU rules written into UK law.Theresa May is reported to have ordered civil servants to find a building for the new department.Leave campaignerLiam Fox, 54, has taken on another newly created position as secretary of state for international trade. He was made secretary of state for defence in 2010 but resigned in 2011 over allegations he had given a close friend, lobbyist Adam Werritty, access to the Ministry of Defence and allowed him to join official trips overseas.Like Mr Davis he is a Eurosceptic who voted to leave the EU and he also stood unsuccessfully for the Conservative Party leadership in 2005.He stood again in the latest race to be leader but was eliminated in the first ballot after winning the support of just 16 MPs.Remain campaignerThe appointment to chief whip is a big step up for Gavin Williamson, according to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg.David Cameron's former parliamentary private secretary, he also served as parliamentary private secretary to transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin.The 40-year-old from North Yorkshire was elected MP for South Staffordshire in 2010. As chief whip, he will attend Cabinet meetings.Remain campaignerKaren Bradley takes over from the deposed John Whittingdale as Culture, Media and Sport Secretary. She had been working with Theresa May as a Home Office minister since 2014.She was first elected MP for Staffordshire Moorlands in May 2010.Her appointment comes two months after Mr Whittingdale and the BBC agreed a major overhaul of the corporation.Read more about her appointment here.Leave campaignerAndrea Leadsom, the Conservative leadership candidate who dramatically pulled out of the race, is the new Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Secretary.The prominent Brexit backer is promoted from energy minister to a cabinet role which will see her take responsibility for a farming industry as it faces the end of European Union subsidies. She will also have to fashion a post-Brexit fisheries policy. Green campaigners will be watching carefully to see what happens to environment regulations in areas including wildlife habitats, air pollution and water quality, currently governed by rules from Europe. Mrs Leadsom's public reason for withdrawing from the leadership race was to allow a rapid transition at the top, and give the economy certainty in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. But our political editor Laura Kuenssberg says her friends were saying she was alarmed by the level of scrutiny given to her comments on motherhood reported in the Times.Read more on Mrs Leadsom's motivations for stepping aside here.Baroness Evans of Bowes Park becomes leader of the House of Lords at 40, in her first ministerial role since being ennobled by David Cameron in 2014.She attended London's Henrietta Barnett School and Cambridge University before becoming deputy director of the Conservative research department, deputy director of the Policy Exchange think-tank and chief operating officer of the New Schools Network - the organisation which ran Michael Gove's free schools programme.Remain campaignerDamian Green is appointed the new Work and Pensions Secretary, taking over from Stephen Crabb, who earlier resigned.Mr Green served as an Immigration Minister and Justice Secretary in the coalition government but has been on the backbenches since 2014.Leave campaignerPriti Patel is the new International Development Secretary, a promotion from her role as employment minister which she's held for just a year.Ms Patel became MP for Witham in 2010 and joined the front bench as a Treasury minister in 2014.She is no stranger to controversy, having previously advocated bringing back the death penalty and was accused of ""divide and rule politics"" during the referendum campaign for claiming that ""biased"" immigration policy prevents curry chefs from outside the EU from working in the UK.On her appointment, she immediately faced calls to guarantee the UK's legal commitment to spending 0.7% of GDP on overseas aid.Remain campaignerGreg Clark is secretary of state of a newly-created ministry of business, energy and industrial strategy.His appointment spells the end for a department which put climate change at the top of the agenda.Just eight years after it was created by then-prime minister Gordon Brown, the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) is being merged into Mr Clark's new department and losing the ""climate change"" part of its name.Environmentalists immediately expressed concern that the reshaping of departments showed the government was downgrading climate change as a priority.But Richard Black, director of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU), said Mr Clark's move was ""an excellent appointment"", saying he ""understands climate change, and has written influential papers on the benefits of Britain developing a low-carbon economy"".Remain campaignerJames Brokenshire, who has been working with Theresa May at the Home Office - where he was immigration minister - has been made Northern Ireland Secretary.He takes over from Theresa Villiers, who resigned from the cabinet having been offered another role but saying it was not one ""which I felt I could take on"". Before entering parliament Mr Brokenshire was a partner at a large international law firm.From 2011 to 2015, he served as security minister at the Home Office with responsibility for domestic national security and counter terrorism. This included supporting the home secretary with oversight of the work of MI5 and the national police counter-terrorism network.His responsibilities also included the government's counter-terrorism strategy and he was part of the prime minister's ""extremism taskforce"". He also led negotiations with the Jordanian government to secure the deportation of the radical cleric Abu Qatada.Read more on his appointment here.Remain campaignerDavid Lidington, former Europe Minister, is promoted to Leader of the House. He had been Europe Minister since 2010 but moves across to a post involving the smooth running of the Commons. The Cambridge history graduate and father-of-four has been MP for Aylesbury since 1992. He previously worked for BP and mining firm Rio Tinto.Campaigned to Remain in the EUPhilip Hammond has been named chancellor of the exchequer. He was foreign secretary under David Cameron from 2014 to 2016, having previously served as defence secretary and transport secretary. He replaces George Osborne.Mr Hammond, 60, is seen at Westminster as the ultimate safe pair of hands. Sometimes mocked as ""box office Phil"" for what some see as his dull delivery, he forged a reputation in the shadow Treasury team as the Tories' public spending ""axeman"".He was seen as a Eurosceptic who spoke of withdrawal if the EU were not reformed, but was a Remain campaigner in the referendum. He now has the job of steering Britain's economy through the choppy post-Brexit waters.Read what Mr Hammond has to say on his first day in the job.Remain campaignerAmber Rudd has been made home secretary, filling the vacancy left by Mrs May. Ms Rudd was formerly energy and climate change secretary, a position she held for just one year.During the campaign for Remain in the EU referendum, she warned in a TV debate that she would not trust the new Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson to drive her home at the end of a night out.The former investment banker, venture capitalist, and financial journalist, aged 52, decided to enter politics in her 40s in order to get ""a grip on her life"". She quickly joined the fast track to the top after being elected to Parliament as MP for Hastings and Rye. She was seen as a protege of then Chancellor George Osborne, serving as his parliamentary private secretary before being promoted to junior minister at the Energy and Climate Change department in 2014. Remain campaignerLiz Truss moves from her role as secretary for environment, food and rural affairs to replace Michael Gove as justice secretary.A qualified management accountant, she became MP for South West Norfolk in 2010 and was appointed education minister in 2012.She was brought up in Yorkshire and attended Roundhay, a comprehensive school in Leeds, and went on to read philosophy, politics and economics at Merton College, Oxford.Socially liberal, the 40-year-old was a founder member of the free enterprise group of Conservative MPs arguing for more deregulation of the economy.Remain campaignerJustine Greening has said she is ""absolutely delighted"" to be made the new education secretary, taking over from Nicky Morgan. She was also appointed minister for women and equalities. Her new department will also take on higher and further education, skills and apprenticeships.Ms Greening leaves her international development secretary post, which she was promoted to in October 2011.MP for Putney since 2005, she became economic secretary to the Treasury after the 2010 election, succeeding Philip Hammond as transport secretary after he was promoted to defence secretary.At London's Pride day on 25 June, two days after the Brexit vote, the 47-year-old announced in a tweet she was in a same-sex relationship, saying ""I campaigned for Stronger In but sometimes you're better off out!"".Read more about what's awaiting Ms Greening at the education department.Leave campaignerChris Grayling, Theresa May's leadership campaign chief, has been appointed transport secretary. He was formerly Leader of the House.The most pressing jobs in his in-tray include dealing with the travel chaos caused by Southern Rail's disrupted services, the expansion of airport capacity in south-east England and high speed rail link, HS2.He's got some experience in this department, having served as shadow transport secretary from December 2005 to 2007.The Brexiteer had a surprisingly low-key, restrained referendum, largely refraining from ""blue-on-blue"" attacks. He was also one of the few Vote Leave spokesmen to share a platform with former UKIP leader Nigel Farage. Remain campaignerPatrick McLoughlin leaves his role as transport secretary to become Conservative Party chairman and chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.An MP since 1986, the former miner also served as chief whip, after being appointed to the role in David Cameron's first cabinet.As transport secretary, he was in charge of several large-scale projects including Crossrail and HS2. The 58-year-old said he was ""very pleased indeed"" with his new role.Remain campaignerSajid Javid is moved sideways from business secretary to secretary of the department for communities and local government.Mr Javid, considered a protege of former chancellor George Osborne's, held the culture secretary position before being appointed to the business role last year and is a former managing director of Deutsche Bank. The 46-year-old University of Exeter graduate stood on a ""joint ticket"" with Stephen Crabb for the leadership election, hoping to be chancellor if Mr Crabb had become PM.Remain campaignerMichael Fallon has kept his job at the Ministry of Defence - a position the 64-year-old has held since 2014.He was Conservative MP for Darlington from 1983 to 1992 - initially during Margaret Thatcher's time in Downing Street - and after leaving Parliament, he was later re-elected as MP for Sevenoaks in 1997.A former Conservative Party deputy chairman, he has previously served as energy and business minister, and before that secretary of state for business and enterprise.Seen as a safe pair of hands in Westminster, he described himself as a ""pretty reluctant Remainer"" after the EU referendum.Remain campaignerDespite earlier speculation, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt remains in his post.The 49-year-old was appointed culture secretary in David Cameron's first coalition government, a role he held for two years - including while London played host to the 2012 Olympic Games.He took over the health portfolio following a cabinet reshuffle in 2012, and described the appointment as the ""biggest privilege of my life"". Most recently, Mr Hunt has been locked in a battle with the British Medical Association over a new contract for junior doctors, which has led to a series of strikes.Remain campaignerDavid Mundell will continue as Secretary of State for Scotland.Mr Mundell, the only Scottish Conservative MP, said his focus was now on ""ensuring Scotland gets the best possible deal out of the EU negotiations"".Former prime minister David Cameron first appointed Mr Mundell to the post when he held his Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale seat for the third consecutive election in 2015.Remain campaignerMay's cabinet: Who's in and who's out? Alun Cairns, MP for the Vale of Glamorgan, remains in his cabinet role as secretary of state for Wales.He was appointed to the post just four months ago so there was little surprise that he will retain his position. The 45-year-old, who was born in Swansea and is a graduate of the University of Wales, Newport, was elected as MP for the Vale of Glamorgan in 2010. He worked in banking for a decade before his election to the Welsh Assembly. Remain campaignerGeorge Osborne has been fired as chancellor.He had been in the Treasury since 2010 - throughout David Cameron's tenure in Downing Street. He had also been first secretary of state since May 2015. A key ally of Mr Cameron, Mr Osborne tweeted it had been a ""privilege"" to be chancellor, adding: ""Others will judge - I hope I've left the economy in a better state than I found it.""Leave campaignerMichael Gove has been fired as justice secretary. The former Times journalist also served under David Cameron as education secretary in the coalition government, and as chief whip.He successfully campaigned for Brexit alongside Boris Johnson - but later withdrew his support for his colleague to be Conservative leader and prime minister, instead standing himself. He was eliminated in the final round of voting by MPs in third place.His surprise move to stand for the leadership and therefore to become prime minister effectively dashed Mr Johnson's hopes of running.Remain campaignerNicky Morgan is to leave her post as education secretary. The 43-year-old, who qualified as a lawyer, became an MP in 2010 and rose to the cabinet position of minister for women and equalities in 2013.London-born Ms Morgan replaced Michael Gove as education secretary in 2014. She reportedly considered standing in the Conservative leadership contest, but ultimately threw her support behind leave campaigner Mr Gove, despite campaigning for a Remain vote herself.In a tweet, she said she was ""disappointed"" not to be continuing her work in the education department, before congratulating her successor Justine Greening, saying she was ""committed to excellence in education"".Remain campaignerWork and Pensions Secretary Stephen Crabb has resigned from government ""in the best interests of my family"". He was one of the four contenders who lost out to Theresa May for the Conservative leadership.BBC political correspondent Vicki Young says it's not yet known whether Mr Crabb was offered a post he did not want or had just decided to resign from the government, possibly following some newspaper stories about his private life at the weekend. Read more about Mr Crabb here.Leave campaignerJohn Whittingdale has left his post as culture secretary. The Leave campaigner was vice-chairman of the influential group of Tory MPs called the 1922 Committee until he took over the portfolio for culture, media and sport after the general election in 2015 from Sajid Javid.In a tweet, he said it had been ""a privilege"" to serve as culture secretary, and wished his successor ""every success"".  Leave campaignerTheresa Villiers steps down as Northern Ireland secretary, saying she declined an offer of another role from the new prime minister.Former barrister Ms Villiers, MP for Chipping Barnet, had held the Northern Ireland portfolio since 2012. Prior to that, she was a Member of the European Parliament for six years.In December 2005, Mr Cameron promoted her to shadow chief secretary to the Treasury. In 2007, she was made a shadow transport minister, a brief she continued to hold when the coalition came to power.She was among prominent figures who campaigned for Brexit.

2017-02-02,The Jeremy Corbyn Story,https://web.archive.org//web/20170202115814/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-34184265,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkJeremy Corbyn's election in September 2015 as Labour leader, at the age of 66, counted as one of the biggest upsets in British political history.His re-election to the post almost a year later was not such a surprise but could prove even more momentous in terms of Labour's direction in the coming years and the future course of British politics.Seeing off the challenge of Owen Smith, who had the backing of the majority of Labour MPs, has made Mr Corbyn, for the time being at least, seemingly unassailable and increased the likelihood that he will lead the opposition into the next general election - scheduled for 2020.If that is the case, Mr Corbyn will be a highly influential figure during one of the most important political periods of the past 50 years - as the clock ticks down to the UK's exit from the EU following the Brexit referendum vote. To his critics, he is almost a caricature of the archetypal ""bearded leftie"", an unelectable throwback to the dark days of the 1980s, when Labour valued ideological purity more than winning power.But to his army of supporters he is the only honest man left in politics, someone who can inspire a new generation of activists, and make them believe that there is an alternative to the neo-liberal Thatcherite consensus that has let them down so badly.A fixture on the British left for more than 40 years, he has been an almost ever-present figure at demos and marches, a joiner of committees, a champion of controversial causes, a tireless pamphleteer, handy with a megaphone.But not even his most ardent admirers would have had him down as a future leader of Her Majesty's opposition. And not just because he believes in the abolition of the Monarchy.Corbyn's brand of left-wing politics was meant to have been consigned to the dustbin of history by New Labour.He belongs to what had been a dwindling band of MPs, which also includes Diane Abbott and John McDonnell, who held fast to their socialist principles as their party marched moved right - and into power - under Tony Blair.At the start of the 2015 leadership contest, after scraping on to the ballot paper at the last minute, thanks to charity nominations from Labour MPs who wanted a token left-wing candidate to ""broaden the debate"", he explained to The Guardian why he had decided to run. ""Well, Diane and John have done it before, so it was my turn."" Asked if he had taken some persuading, he replied: ""Yeah. I have never held any appointed office, so in that sense it's unusual, but if I can promote some causes and debate by doing this, then good. That's why I'm doing it."" He added: ""At my age I'm not likely to be a long-term contender, am I?""That view was quickly revised as Corbynmania took hold. Something about the Islington North MP struck a chord with Labour leadership voters in a way that his three younger, more polished, more careerist, rivals patently did not.Despite, or perhaps because, of his unassuming, low-key style, he seemed able to inspire people who had lost faith in Labour during the Blair/Brown years and bring hope to young activists fired up by his anti-austerity message. His entry into the contest also prompted a surge in people - many from the left of the existing Labour membership - joining the party or paying £3 to become registered supporters. His perceived integrity and lifelong commitment to the socialist cause made him an attractive option to many left-wing voters jaded by the spin and soundbites of the Westminster political classes. Over the course of a year or so since becoming leader he has become something of a cult figure - ironic for someone who always insisted he didn't do personality politics and had never tried to cultivate a following among MPs.Instead of amusing anecdotes about youthful indiscretions, or tales of climbing Westminster's greasy pole, his political biography is dominated by the list of the causes he has championed and committees he has served on.He once confessed he had never smoked cannabis - practically unheard of in the left-wing circles he grew up in, but the mark of a man who is known for his austere, almost ascetic, approach to life.His frugality is legendary. He usually has the lowest expenses claims of any MP.""Well, I don't spend a lot of money, I lead a very normal life, I ride a bicycle and I don't have a car,"" he told The Guardian.Asked what his favourite biscuit was during a Mumsnet Q&A , he answered: ""I'm totally anti-sugar on health grounds, so eat very few biscuits, but if forced to accept one, it's always a pleasure to have a shortbread.""Jeremy Bernard Corbyn had an impeccable middle-class upbringing.He spent his early years in the picturesque Wiltshire village of Kington St Michael. When he was seven, the family moved to a seven-bedroomed manor house in the hamlet of Pave Lane, in Shropshire. The youngest of four boys, he enjoyed an idyllic childhood in what he himself has called a rural ""Tory shire"". Personal life: Lives with third wife. Has three sons from earlier marriage.Food and drink: A vegetarian who rarely drinks alcohol. According to The Guardian, his favourite restaurant is Gaby's diner in London's West End, where he likes to eat hummus after taking part in demonstrations in Trafalgar Square.Hobbies: Running, cycling, cricket and Arsenal football club. According to the Financial Times: ""He loves making jam with fruit grown on his allotment, belongs to the All Party Parliamentary Group for Cheese and is a borderline trainspotter."" He does not own a car. He is known for having an unusual hobby - an interest in the history and design of manhole covers.Culture: A lover of the works of Irish poet WB Yeats. His favourite novelist is said to be the late Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe, whose most famous work, Things Fall Apart, is about the tensions between colonialism and traditional societies. He is a fluent Spanish speaker and enjoys Latin American literature. His favourite films are said to be The Great Gatsby and Casablanca.His brother Piers, now a meteorologist known for denying climate change is a product of human activity, has described the Corbyn boys as ""country bumpkins"".Corbyn disagrees with his brother on climate change but they remain close. They both learned their politics at the family dinner table, where left-wing causes and social justice were a frequent topic of debate.Their maths teacher mother Naomi and electrical engineer father David were peace campaigners who met at a London rally for supporters of Spain's Republicans in the fight against Franco's fascists.Piers, who would go on to be a well-known squatters leader in 1960s London, was even further to the left than Jeremy. Both boys joined the local Wrekin Labour Party and the Young Socialists while still at school.Corbyn had begun his education at the fee-paying preparatory school, Castle House, in Newport, before moving into the state sector, after passing his 11-plus.He was one of only two Labour-supporting boys at Adams Grammar School, in Newport, when his class held a mock election in 1964.In an interview with The Sun, his friend Bob Mallett recalls Corbyn being jeered by his right-wing schoolmates: ""Jeremy was the Labour candidate and I his campaign manager because at a middle-class boarding grammar school in leafy Shropshire, there weren't many socialists. We were trounced.""Corbyn left Adams with two A levels, both at grade E, and an enduring hatred of selective education.""It was an illegal war and therefore [Tony Blair] has to explain to that. Is he going to be tried for it? I don't know. Could he be tried for it? Possibly,"" on the Iraq war.""Are super-rich people actually happy with being super-rich? I would want the super rich to pay properly their share of the needs of the rest of the community,"" on Channel 4 News.""He was a fascinating figure who observed a great deal and from whom we can learn a great deal,"" on Karl Marx to the BBC's Andrew Marr.""Without exception, the majority electricity, gas, water and railway infrastructures of Britain were built through public investment since the end of WW2 and were all privatised at knockdown prices for the benefit of greedy asset-strippers by the Thatcher and Major-led Tory governments,"" in his column for the Morning Star newspaper.""Some people say to me, are we still worried about Hiroshima. My reply is that the weapons were used specifically against civilians and while 'fireworks' compared to what is now available, killed and have killed for the past 59 years. Nuclear weapons have saved no lives, killed thousands and maimed many more and impoverished the poor nations who have them,"" on his website.""I started wearing a beard when I was 19 and living in Jamaica; they called me 'Mr Beardman,'"" on winning the Beard Liberation Front's Beard of the Year award in 2002.He reportedly split up with his second wife Claudia after she insisted on sending their son Ben - now a football coach with Premier League Watford - to Queen Elizabeth Grammar School, in Barnet, instead of an Islington comprehensive.After leaving school, Corbyn spent two years in Jamaica, with Voluntary Service Overseas, something he has described as an ""amazing"" experience. Back in the UK he threw himself into trade union activism, initially with now long defunct National Union of Tailors and Garment Makers.He started a course in Trade Union Studies at North London Polytechnic but left after a series of arguments with his tutors over the curriculum.""He probably knew more than them,"" Piers told The Sun.A successful career as a trade union organiser followed, with the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union (AEEU) and then the National Union of Public Employees (NUPE).But his real passion was for Labour Party politics - and in 1974 he was elected to Haringey District Council, in North London.In the same year he married fellow Labour councillor, Jane Chapman, a university lecturer.Chapman says she married Corbyn for his ""honesty"" and ""principles"" but she soon grew weary of his intense focus on politics. ""Politics became our life. He was out most evenings because when we weren't at meetings he would go to the Labour headquarters, and do photocopying - in those days you couldn't print because there were no computers,' she told The Mail on Sunday.""Jeremy is a saintly figure of enormous personal integrity. He is a man who lives his life according to his beliefs,"" former Labour MP Chris Mullin, speaking to Panorama.""If Jeremy Corbyn becomes leader it won't be a defeat like 1983 or 2015 at the next election. It will mean rout, possibly annihilation"", former Labour leader and prime minister Tony Blair.""The showbiz glitz of New Labour temporarily hid the hole where the heart of Labour was supposed to be. Now the 'Corbynites' (whoever expected to use that phrase?) are trying to hide that hole behind some old banners and a bloke with a beard,"" left-wing commentator Mick Hume.""There is something inherently virtuous about him, and that is a quality that can rally the support of a lot of people, and most importantly, a lot of young people,"" singer and activist Charlotte Church (pictured).""While most of his chums have all moderated their views, dumped their corduroy jackets and grey suits, shaved their beards and quietly cancelled their CND subscriptions, [he] has hardly changed a bit; he is the Fidel Castro of London N1,"" Telegraph journalist Robert Hardman.They shared a love of animals, they had a tabby cat called Harold Wilson, and enjoyed camping holidays together in Europe on Corbyn's motorbike.But fun was in short supply at home, recalls Chapman, who remains in touch with Corbyn and backed his leadership bid.During their five years together he never once took her dinner, she told The Mail, preferring instead to ""grab a can of beans and eat it straight from the can"" to save time.In 1987, Corbyn married Claudia Bracchita, a Chilean exile, with whom he had three sons. The youngest, Tommy, was born while Corbyn was lecturing NUPE members elsewhere in the same hospital. Twenty-five-year-old Seb has been helping out on his father's leadership campaign. The couple separated in 1999, but remained on good terms. Corbyn got married for a third time last year, to his long term partner Laura Alvarez, a 46-year-old Mexican fair trade coffee importer.In the bitter internal warfare that split Labour in the late 1970s and early eighties, Corbyn was firmly on the side of the quasi-Marxist hard left. A Labour man to his fingertips - he was no Militant ""entryist"" trying to infiltrate the party by stealth - he nevertheless found common cause with former Trotskyists such as Ted Knight, and joined them in their battle to push the party to the left.He became a disciple of Tony Benn, sharing his mentor's brand of democractic socialism, with its belief in worker controlled industries and state planning of the economy, as well as Benn's commitment to unilateral nuclear disarmament and a united Ireland.Here is just a small selection of the campaigns Jeremy Corbyn has been involved with over the past 50 years.Nuclear disarmament: Joined CND as a schoolboy in 1966Irish Republicanism: Organised Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams' visit to the Commons in 1983. Once employed Irish Republican dissident Ronan Bennett as a member of staff at WestminsterMiners' strike: Invited striking miners into Commons gallery in 1985 who were expelled for shouting ""Coal not Dole""Anti-Apartheid: serving on the National Executive of the Anti-Apartheid Movement, and was arrested in 1984 for protesting outside South Africa HousePalestinian solidarity: A member of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign and campaigns regularly against the conflict in GazaMiscarriages of justice: Worked on on behalf of the Guildford Four and Birmingham Six, who were eventually found to be have been wrongly convicted of IRA bombings in England in the mid-1970sAnimal rights: Joined the League Against Cruel Sports at school, became a vegetarian at 20, after working on a pig farmIraq war: Chaired the Stop the War coalitionGay rights: Spoke out in 1983 on a ""No socialism without gay liberation"" platform and continued to campaign for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender rightsCorbyn was never seen as a great orator like Benn, or a firebrand like miners' leader Arthur Scargill, but he worked tirelessly behind the scenes, his trousers stained with purple ink from the copying machines that produced the pamphlets and newspapers that were the lifeblood of the British Left in the pre-internet era.He ran the London Labour Briefing newspaper, which helped propel Ken Livingstone to power on the Greater London Council.He was elected to Parliament in 1983, to represent his home patch of Islington North, a seat he has held ever since and where he has increased his majority from 5,600 to 21,000, and as a back benchers was by most accounts a popular and hard-working MP.The Bennite faction that Corbyn belonged to was already in retreat, following their leader's failure to capture the deputy leadership of the party in 1981.After fighting and losing the 1983 election on arguably the most left-wing manifesto it had ever put before the British public, with its commitment to renationalising the utilities just privatised by the Thatcher government, pulling out of the EU, nuclear disarmament and the creation of a ""national investment bank"" to create jobs, Labour began the painful process of ""modernisation"" that led to the birth of New Labour.And Corbyn would spend the next 32 years on the backbenches fighting a rearguard action against his party's abandonment of the radical policies and values contained in the '83 manifesto in the name of electability, under Neil Kinnock, John Smith and, most notably, Tony Blair.Corbyn might have hailed from the same North London district as Blair and entered Parliament in the same year but that is where the similarity ended.He abhorred Blair's embrace of free market economics and did his best to be a thorn in the younger man's side throughout his time in Downing Street, although Blair's large majorities ensured the damage was barely noticeable.He would always vote with his conscience, rather than be dictated to by the party whips. It earned him the accolade of being Labour's most rebellious MP, defying the party managers more than 500 times.It also meant he and his allies became increasingly isolated, with their views and interventions ignored by the mainstream media and most of their colleagues on the Labour benches.Blair's dire warnings that Labour would face ""annihilation"" if it elected Corbyn during the leadership contest were met by Corbyn with a suggestion that his predecessor as Labour leader should probably face trial for war crimes over his role in the Iraq war.Corbyn and his comrades - unlike their modernising colleagues they would use the term without irony - routinely attached themselves to any cause that felt like it would strike a blow against British and American ""imperialism"" or the Israeli state.Internationalist in outlook, they would proclaim solidarity with socialist campaigns and governments in places like Cuba, Chile, Nicaragua, El Salvador and attack US policies that, in Corbyn's view, enslaved the Latin American world.He incurred the wrath of the Labour leadership early on his career when he invited two former IRA prisoners to speak at Westminster, two weeks after the Brighton bomb that had nearly killed Margaret Thatcher and her cabinet. Later on it would be his willingness to share platforms with representatives of Hamas and Hezbollah that would put him at the centre of controversy. When challenged, he insists he does not share their views but that peace will never be achieved without talking to all sides.He may have been largely sidelined in the House of Commons, respected but too much of a known quantity to have an impact, but Corbyn's stature and profile outside Parliament continued to grow.He chaired the Stop the War Coalition and became a leading figure in the anti-austerity movement, which began to attract large crowds of young activists eager for something to believe in and to take the fight to then Prime Minister David Cameron.Still, no one gave Corbyn a prayer when he entered the contest to succeed Ed Miliband as Labour leader, with bookmakers offering a price of 200-1.His elevation to rock star status, among the crowds who flocked to his leadership campaign meetings, must have been as much of a shock to Corbyn as it was to his opponents, but he never showed it.He carried on, just as he always had, railing against inequality, talking about hope, promising to renationalise industries, tax the rich and scrap Trident, and wearing the same white, open-necked shirt with pens sticking out of the top pocket.Only now people were listening. During that leadership campaign Jeremy Corbyn is understood to have rejected pleas from some supporters for him to stand aside, having made his point and injected new life into Labour's left, to leave the field clear for a younger candidate who might have more electoral appeal. He appeared determined to make a go of the leadership.Many ""moderate"" shadow cabinet members returned to the backbenches rather than serve under him but he was able to put together a top team that reflected a broad range of opinion within the party.He sought to bring a new approach to leadership, adopting a less confrontational and more conversational tone at Prime Minister's Questions and generally refraining from either sound bites or photo opportunities - to the exasperation of what his supporters call the ""mainstream media"" and the derision of some commentators. The coalition behind Mr Corbyn held together for nine months, despite growing discontent among Labour MPs who had never wanted him as leader and could not accept either his style of leadership or his policies.The EU referendum brought things to a head. Corbyn, who had been a Eurosceptic as a backbencher, was accused of mounting a half-hearted campaign to keep Britain in the EU and of not appearing to care too much that his side had lost.Labour MPs, some of whom had been plotting to topple Corbyn at some point, saw this as the chance to make their move to try and force him to stand down, amid fears they would be wiped out at a snap election they expected to follow the referendum with him as leader.He faced a mass walkout from the shadow cabinet and then a vote of no confidence, which he lost by 172 votes to 40, as Labour MPs - enemies and previously loyal shadow ministers alike - urged him to quit.He refused to budge, pointing to the huge mandate he had received from Labour members and arguing that he had done better than many had expected in the electoral tests he had faced since becoming leader.MPs selected Owen Smith, a former member of his shadow cabinet who claimed to share the same left wing values, to take him on in another leadership election.So Jeremy Corbyn, the reluctant leader who had to be persuaded to stand in 2015, now found himself fighting to hold on to a position he never expected to hold, this time as favourite rather than as outsider. And, back on the campaign trail among his own supporters, he seemed to rather enjoy himself. As was the case a year earlier, thousands of people flocked to hear Mr Corbyn speak at rallies across the country  - 10,000 turned up at a single event in Liverpool - as he sought to tap directly into grassroots support for his message as a counterweight to the perceived hostility of the ""mainstream media"". In an unconventional campaign which saw him endorsed by UB40 but vilified by JK Rowling, the only genuine moment of discomfort came during ""traingate"" - when his claims that a train was so ""ram-packed"" that he had to sit on the floor came into question after Virgin Trains released footage showing him passing empty seats.Mr Corbyn's re-election has strengthened his position, with signs some of his critics are willing to serve under him again despite their differences.But it remains to be seen whether his commitment to reach out to his opponents and focus squarely on winning the next election will act as springboard to a new phase of his leadership or prove only a temporary respite in what some have said is an existential battle for control of the party.

2017-02-02,And we're off,https://web.archive.org//web/20170202115814/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38830552,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkIt's begun. After decades of debate, years of acrimony over the issue in the Conservative Party, months of brutal brinksmanship in Westminster, and hours of debate this week, MPs have just approved the very first step in the process of Britain leaving the European Union. There are many hurdles ahead, probably thousands of hours of debate here, years of negotiations for Theresa May with our friends and rivals around the EU, as she seeks a deal - and possibly as long as a decade of administrative adjustments, as the country extricates itself from the EU. On a wet Wednesday, the debate didn't feel epoch-making, but think for a moment about what has just happened. MPs, most of whom wanted to stay in the EU, have just agreed that we are off.  This time last year few in Westminster really thought that this would happen. The then prime minister's concern was persuading the rest of the EU to give him a better deal for the UK. His close colleagues believed the chances of them losing, let alone the government dissolving over the referendum, were slim, if not quite zero.Then tonight, his former colleagues are rubber stamping the decision of a narrow majority of the public, that changed everything in politics here for good. This isn't even the  last vote on this bill. There are several more stages, the Lords are likely to kick up rough at the start. But after tonight, for better or worse, few will believe that our journey to the exit door can be halted.As government ministers have said in recent days, the moment for turning back is past. "
2017-02-02,Brexit debate notes,https://web.archive.org//web/20170202115814/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-parliaments-38833310,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkI've got five take-outs from the Article 50 bill so far.There may be 101 pages of amendments down so far, but the government is in no mood to take any of them on board; on the contrary, their aim is to repel boarders, to the point where they would even resist the one amendment being mooted by the Brexiteer camp, which would aim to forbid ministers from accepting any extra time to extend the two year negotiating window specified by the EU's Lisbon Treaty. Ministers do believe that the EU's Michel Barnier's strategy is to enmesh the UK in a long-term negotiating limbo, perhaps including a post-Brexit transitional deal, but they don't want their hands tied.Many of the amendments, thus far, look like the product of an amendment generating bot, standard stuff about laying reports and regular debates. But ministers are wary of some of the substantive ones setting conditions - and in particular of the emotive issue of EU nationals resident in Britain, a matter now featuring regularly in most MPs' constituency surgeries. There is strong pressure for some kind of unilateral move for the UK to guarantee their right to remain - but, the government retorts, if that was passed, its backers would be to blame if one or two European states didn't reciprocate and allow UK nationals to stay within their borders.In the debate, Labour's frontbench Brexit spokesman, Sir Keir Starmer, looked and sounded like a lawyer delivering a plea in mitigation on behalf of a convicted prisoner. Early in his speech, he appealed to the Commons for a courteous hearing - something his opposite number, David Davis, would never have got away with. It just about worked, because the House genuinely wanted to hear what he had to say, but he does suffer from the lawyer-turned politician's tendency to address MPs as if they were the Court of Appeal. But leaving aside the style points, forging a line on Brexit which can stitch together the strongly pro-Brexit and strongly pro-Remain elements of Labour's heartland, let alone unify the deeply divided Parliamentary Labour Party, may prove an impossible challenge.Whether it's in the leadership ratings in Conservative Home, where he has now edged ahead of the prime minister herself, or in the growls of approval from his colleagues in the regular statements in the chamber, the Brexit Secretary, David Davis, increasingly commands the status of second minister in this government. This is not a wholly comfortable place to be - flying perilously near to the Sun - but as someone reconciled, not that long ago, to seeing out their parliamentary career on the backbenches, I suspect Mr Davis can bear it. The Lib Dems have sought to position themselves as the last champions of the Remain cause (although two of their MPs, Norman Lamb and Greg Mulholland have promised to abstain on the Article 50 Bill). But they can't claim to be the arch-opponents of Brexit and fail to maintain a presence for the big debates on it - and their leader, Tim Farron, had a chastening time at PMQs when this was pointed out. In truth, their much-reduced parliamentary party has been pretty bad at showing the flag, since the last election. It's rare to see all nine Lib Dem MPs on the green benches. This is one area where they are not very good at remaining. "

The House of Commons says: ""All petitions are checked for fraudulent activity, using both automated and manual checks. The checks prevent fraudulent signatures being added to petitions by individuals trying to repeatedly sign, or automated attacks (bots).""It adds that there is a balance to be made between making it easy for people to sign while making it harder to do so repeatedly.The procedures have been tightened up since last June, when at least 77,000 fraudulent signatures were removed from a petition calling for a second EU referendum.An investigation was launched after posts were found on websites from people claiming to have written programs that would automatically sign the petition thousands of times.The House of Commons will not give details of either the original or new security procedures it has put in place.It is not immediately obvious how the system works to prevent people voting more than once, but fraudulent signatures have been disqualified in the past. It should be said that both petitions have received considerably more than the 100,000 signatures, above which petitions ""almost always"" trigger a debate in Parliament.Read more from Reality Check"
2017-02-02,State visit politics,https://web.archive.org//web/20170202115814/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-38808647,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkA state visit is the ultimate weapon of British diplomacy, the bunker buster of soft power that can break down the hardest of tyrannical hearts. Few world leaders can resist the siren lure of all that royal bling: horse-drawn coaches, state banquets, processions down the Mall, the sheer scale of all that gold leaf and pomp and flummery that allows them a brief window into a royal fantasy that many countries envy but can rarely match. This weapon is deployed sparingly, normally no more than twice a year. But it does get used. If Donald Trump does touch down for a little red carpet treatment later this year, it will be the 110th time the Queen has welcomed another head of state to these shores in her reign. And for now, despite the protests and growing online petition, Downing Street is continuing to stand firm, insisting that the invitation to the president stands.So state visits are not merely ceremonial affairs, they are political and purposeful. They are used by the British government of the day to further what they see as Britain's national interests. In 1973, the Queen welcomed President Mobutu of what was then called Zaire in Africa, now the Democratic Republic of Congo. He was a brutal, corrupt dictator but he was also seen as a vital anti-communist ally in the Cold War against the Soviet Union. So he got an invite to the Palace. President Suharto of Indonesia, another repressive leader who happened to be anti-communist, was also granted a state visit in 1979 for the same reasons.In 1971, Emperor Hirohito of Japan was welcomed by the Queen for a state visit as a deliberate attempt to help usher the country back into the family of nations after its post-war isolation. Not surprisingly, the invitation of the man who had led Japan during World War Two was hugely controversial, and many former army veterans and prisoners of war turned their backs on the royal procession in silent protest. Some wore red gloves to symbolise the blood they saw as being on his hands while others whistled ribald old army tunes. A tree the Emperor had planted was uprooted.In 1978, Nicolae Ceausescu, the notorious Romanian communist leader, and his wife Elena were given a state visit in the vain hope that they might be encouraged to introduce some pro-Western reforms. The Queen was so repulsed by them that, according to the royal author Robert Hardman, while out walking her dogs, she hid behind a bush in the Palace gardens to avoid bumping into the couple who were also out strolling. More than a decade later both Ceausescu and his wife were executed by a revolutionary firing squad.And even the most uncontroversial of state visits, that of President Mandela in 1996, was not without political purpose. There was a feeling in the Foreign Office that South Africa was beginning to slip away from the West towards the unaligned nations, and they wanted to hug Madiba close and remind his country of Britain's anti-apartheid credentials.More recently, in 2014, the state visit of the Irish president to Britain was used as another step of reconciliation. Martin McGuiness, the former Northern Ireland deputy first minister and former IRA leader, not only put on white tie and tails for a state banquet at Windsor Castle, but he also stood for a toast to the Queen. And the state visit of President Xi in 2015 was a deliberate attempt by George Osborne, the then Chancellor, to curry favour with the Chinese and boost British trade links.As for American presidents, only two have been granted full state visits during the current Queen's reign: President Bush in 2003 and President Obama in 2011.What is unusual is the speed with which Mr Trump has been issued with an invitation for a state visit, just days into his presidency. Both Messrs Bush and Obama had to wait until well into their terms of office before they got the call. The haste reflects the importance the prime minister places on securing a good relationship with the new president and winning a post-Brexit trade deal, even if there is some political cost. Mr Bush's visit was by no means uncontroversial, coming so soon after the beginning of the Iraq war. There were demonstrations throughout the trip, including one involving tens of thousands in central London when an effigy of the president was toppled over in a parody of events in Baghdad. So the Queen may be above politics but state visits are not. They are used for diplomacy and are often controversial. And whatever protests may surround any Trump state visit, the Queen will have seen it all before. Rarely has she shown herself unable to cope with whomsoever the government brings round for tea. As one royal insider told me dryly: ""She does have some experience in these matters.""Or as former foreign secretary William Hague wrote more bluntly in the Telegraph this morning, ""A Queen who has been asked over the decades to host tyrants such as Presidents Mobutu of Zaire and Ceausescu of Romania is going to take a brash billionaire from New York effortlessly in her stride.""

2017-02-02,By-election battle,https://web.archive.org//web/20170202115814/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38808154,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkCould voters who chose to leave the EU at the referendum propel UKIP to victory in Stoke-on-Trent Central?A whopping 69% of the electorate across Stoke chose Leave at the EU referendum. A paltry 50% bothered to vote in the constituency at the general election.If UKIP can get out the leavers they can win, or so goes the theory. As it happens both the Labour and Conservative candidates voted Remain at the referendum.Labour's man Gareth Snell even published a rude poem on Twitter about Brexit's flaws. To add to the fun, he has been just as rude about Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell on Twitter.When I ask him if Labour's leader would make a good prime minister he gives an unusually nuanced answer for a candidate: ""Jeremy is the leader of our party. I will campaign for whoever the leader of our party is to be prime minister. ""If that's Jeremy I'll do all I can to make sure he steps through the door of 10 Downing Street.""A UKIP victory here would make good the long-held theory of party leader and candidate Paul Nuttall that his party can defeat Labour in parliamentary elections.Winning a seat at Westminster for himself would also see him triumph where his predecessor Nigel Farage failed. No wonder there's a glint in his eye.The idea of a UKIP win fits the key themes of the moment: Labour struggling, opposition to mainstream parties thriving. But that's why we should be cautious.Let's start with a confession: by-election speculation is grounded on even fewer facts than chatter about national politics. Rather than having those national polls about which we're so sceptical, we have no worthwhile polling at all.Candidates reporting the universally warm reception they have received on the doorstep are taking part in a grand tradition, but offering no evidence.UKIP's performance in by-elections since 2015 has been underwhelming; their best result in a parliamentary contest was a 3% improvement in their vote in Oldham West.In council by elections since September they've held one seat and made one gain from Labour, lost two to the Conservatives and one to the Lib Dems. It's not much of a surge.While the Conservatives are thought to have a much better chance in the by-election in Copeland, they ran UKIP close in Stoke in 2015.Their candidate Jack Brereton sticks with unerring consistency to a handful of talking points, brooking little deviation and plenty of repetition.Why did he vote to remain at the referendum? ""I voted Remain and I've been open and honest about that because - um - but we need to get beyond that, it's about now delivering Brexit,"" he answers.If it's a maddening (for an interviewer) habit to acquire aged 25 it's also the habit of someone who has already become a Tory council cabinet member in a Labour area.Labour's Snell meanwhile is a borough councillor, and argues that while local voters are concerned about Brexit they want to know what plan the prime minister has for jobs and investment in Stoke. On this topic he sounds more sure-footed.UKIP's Nuttall is frank about his tactics. He says: ""If we turn this into a referendum on Brexit we win this seat. It really is as simple as that. The Liberal Democrats did it in Richmond which is a big Remain seat. If we do the same we're in with a really good chance.""Those Liberal Democrats are making their play for the 30% of the vote that rejected Brexit and could woo Labour voters unconvinced by Corbyn, although their candidate Dr Zulfiqar Ali saw his vote plunge 17.5% at the last general election.Bizarrely, in the right places UKIP and the Lib Dems share a strategy - trying to fight out the referendum again on opposing sides and playing to the passions of the politics it left in its wake. UKIP have money - privately they expect to hit the spending limit - and seem to be better organised in Stoke than in other recent contests. The idea that they can use this moment to prise Labour's traditional support away certainly rattles many in Corbyn's party.Shadow cabinet members talk grimly about the idea many voters now identify more with people who vote as they did at the referendum than with those who voted like them at the general election.A compelling fight in Stoke-on-Trent then, but one in its earliest stages. Anyone forecasting the outcome with certainty is placing great store by precedent, doorstep sentiment or hunch.The nomination deadline is 16:00 BST on 31 January.Here is a list of the candidates declared so far:"
2017-02-02,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20170202115814/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38797243,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe claim: The six strongest pro-Leave constituencies and the six strongest pro-Remain constituencies all have Labour MPs.Reality Check verdict: The best estimates available suggest that two of the six most pro-Remain constituencies have SNP MPs, while three of the six most pro-Leave constituencies have Conservative MPs.Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said on Friday that any leader would be challenged by the situation in which the six most passionate pro-Leave and pro-Remain constituencies all had MPs from their party.The EU referendum vote nationwide was close, with 48.1% voting Remain and 51.9% Leave.But Remain voters tended to be clustered in big cities and in Scotland and Northern Ireland, while the Leave vote was more evenly spread.This means that while a small majority of the country voted Leave, a large majority of the country's 650 parliamentary constituencies did so.The votes in June were counted by council, of which there are far fewer - about 400. This is because cities tend to have one council but several Westminster constituencies.This means in most cases we cannot say exactly how each parliamentary constituency voted.  However, Chris Hanretty, an academic at the University of East Anglia, has used the results for local authorities to make detailed estimates for each constituency.These are based on other things we know about the area, such as age, education, ethnicity and income, and how strongly those factors correlate with a vote for Brexit in the places where we know the vote at constituency level for sure.Mr Hanretty estimates that most constituencies where Remain support was the highest did indeed vote Labour in 2015, although Glasgow North and Edinburgh North, both represented by the SNP, are exceptions.But that's not the picture in the areas that most passionately backed Leave.The Brexit vote was strongest in parts of eastern England, especially Lincolnshire, which backed the Conservatives in 2015.Mr Hanretty estimates that Conservative-held Boston and Skegness was the constituency with the highest Leave vote.It covers the Boston council area, which recorded the strongest vote to leave the EU of any local authority, and part of East Lindsey, another overwhelmingly pro-Brexit area.It's true that some places where Leave support was strongest voted Labour in 2015, such as Doncaster North, Ed Miliband's constituency. But the Leave vote was highest in Conservative parts of eastern England.Read more from Reality Check"

2017-02-02,Meet the EU's chief Brexit negotiator,https://web.archive.org//web/20170202115814/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37542204,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe British papers love a French villain at the heart of the EU.Is Michel Barnier about to succeed Jacques Delors as the object of their affection? The veteran Gaullist already has form.When he was Commissioner for the Internal Market and Financial Services, Mr Barnier was dubbed ""the most dangerous man in Europe"" after taking on the banking sector and championing a cap on bankers' bonuses. But while he alarmed some in the City, and will probably do so again, he also won grudging respect as a tough but even-handed negotiator.He will need all those skills and more in his new role - chief Brexit negotiator at the European Commission. And having moved seamlessly between big jobs in Paris and Brussels - French foreign minister, Commissioner, MEP - he looks well prepared. ""Don't ask me to tell you what will be at the end of the road, we haven't begun to walk yet,"" he told a conference in Brussels last month. Mr Barnier will stick closely to the official EU position of ""no negotiation without notification"" - waiting for the UK to trigger Article 50 to start the formal process of withdrawal. But he's clearly eager to get going.""I am waiting to begin,"" he said. ""I will be ready tomorrow to negotiate, frankly speaking.""And he will bring with him an instinctive pro-European agenda, and a deep knowledge of the workings of the single market.His deputy as chief Brexit negotiator is a German trade expert, Sabine Weyand, adding to the impression that Mr Barnier will lead a team that means business.One of the biggest challenges he (and his boss Jean-Claude Juncker) faces, is to ensure that representatives of the big member states don't sideline him in the Brexit divorce negotiations.But Mr Barnier's long career in French politics means he could well have the ear of the Elysee Palace, especially if - as looks likely - a centre-right candidate wins the French presidency next year. The stakes are so high that there are bound to be some clashes.Mr Barnier has sparred with the UK's Minister for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, before, when the men both served as Europe ministers in the 1990s. It is another reminder that Michel Barnier is a politician first and foremost, rather than a bureaucrat. There have certainly been criticisms - a dash of vanity, a lack of attention to detail. His career has had plenty of downs as well as ups.But he will defend his European vision to the end, and the British government would do well not to underestimate him.At the height of the eurozone crisis, Mr Barnier always refused (politely) to do broadcast interviews in English.""One wrong word,"" he told me once with a smile, ""and we could move markets.""The next few years will be equally challenging."

Scotland voted 62% in favour of Remain.The conversation online was being driven overwhelmingly by pro-independence campaigners. But people who had supported ""Better Together"" during the Scottish referendum vote also spoke about the possibility of a break-away from the UK as a result of the vote over EU membership.  Perhaps the most significant was Scottish author JK Rowling who tweeted: ""Scotland will seek independence now. Cameron's legacy will be breaking up two unions. Neither needed to happen.""Many took to Twitter to express new or strengthened pro-independence feelings in the wake of the latest vote (Just as a reminder: a ""Yes"" vote in Scotland's 2014 referendum was for independence, while the winning ""No"" campaign backed staying in the UK).One old tweet from 2014's independence referendum gained new life on Friday.

She will argue that she wants a ""new, positive and constructive"" relationship with the EU after Brexit - and will use one-to-one talks with German chancellor Angela Merkel and Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy to promise the UK will remain a ""reliable partner"".She is also expected to stress that a strong EU is in the interests of the UK.Mrs May's visit comes two days after MPs voted to allow her to get Brexit negotiations under way.She is expected to have an informal ""brush by"" with Malta's prime minister, Joseph Muscat, who told the BBC's World Service that while he wants a ""fair deal"" for the UK after Brexit, it must be ""inferior"" to full EU membership.""No one wants the UK economy to suffer, I think this is a lose-lose situation,"" said Mr Muscat, whose country holds the rotating European Council presidency.While he says he expects a transitional deal for Britain will be agreed quite easily, he stressed: ""Now, in my book if you're not part of the single market, that is an inferior deal. But maybe for the British government if you're not part of the single market but get to control your borders that's a superior deal.""By John Pienaar, BBC deputy political editorBritain's strategic ambition to act as a bridge between Europe and the United States long predates Brexit, but it has now become a central component of the government's hopes of keeping and building influence in the world. Theresa May will tell EU leaders of her particular achievement - as Downing Street sees it - in drawing a promise of a 100% commitment to Nato from Donald Trump, following earlier indications that his commitment to the Western alliance was wavering. But pressing for higher defence spending looks like a tough ask. And her hopes of becoming a bridge - or honest broker - between the EU and the US won't be easily fulfilled either. Mr Trump is no supporter of the EU - he favours nation-to-nation relationships.He's also mentioned the German leader Angela Merkel in the same breath as Vladimir Putin in discussing future relations, and the French President Francois Hollande has urged EU leaders to stand up to him. Like much of the prime minister's post-Brexit mission, this strategic ambition is more easily conceived than carried out.Mrs May was the first foreign leader to visit the Trump White House and she will use the European Council summit to tell Nato members they need to increase their spending on defence.Mr Trump had previously called the transatlantic alliance ""obsolete"", but Mrs May will tell EU leaders that at talks in the US last week, he confirmed he was ""100% behind Nato"".But while close trade and strategic ties with the Trump administration are central to Downing Street's plans for Britain after Brexit, relations between the White House and European leaders are already strained, after the US ban on refugees and visa holders from a number of mainly Muslim countries.Speaking at a joint press conference in Washington with President Trump last Friday, Mrs May said the burden of spending within Nato should be more ""fairly shared"". Nato estimates for 2016 show that only five alliance members - the US, UK, Greece, Poland and Estonia - will spend a minimum of 2% of national output (GDP) on defence, which is the target.However, Swedish foreign minister Margot Wallström told the BBC her country, which is an EU member but not a full Nato member, will not commit to the 2% target.""No... We'll put together a parliamentary commission that will look into this and decide what priorities there should be on defence spending in the future,"" she told Radio 4's Today.She also dismissed the suggestion President Trump could be brought on board by European countries if they committed to that 2% target, adding: ""That means you will have to reduce other types of spending, so you'll always have to make a political choice.""I really think we should invest in building peace and making sure that we have a political situation in Europe and the world that reduces the tensions and creates better chances for peace.""Mr Trump has said that Nato allies are over-reliant on the US and has questioned whether the US should defend any alliance partner, under Article 5, if so many of the 28 Nato members are not paying their way.But Ms Wallström said: ""Sometimes it's an advantage of not being a member of Nato - we decide for ourselves. We decide also our own spending and budget.""Mrs May is expected to depart from Valletta after morning discussions, leaving the remaining EU leaders to discuss plans for a summit in Rome in March and the future of the EU.

The committee said ministers should consider using incentives such as reductions in National Insurance contributions to encourage employers to employ people with disabilities.Committee chairman Frank Field said: ""We expect the government to respond to this report before the proposed new lower rate of ESA is due in April.""If they intend to proceed with these cuts, we expect an explanation of how this will not be detrimental to its target of halving the disability employment gap, by making finding and keeping a job even more difficult for disabled people than it already is.""A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said: ""The number of disabled people in work has increased by almost 600,000 in the last three years, but we're determined to go even further.""Our Work and Health Green Paper marks the next stage of our action to confront the attitudes, prejudices and misunderstandings that have become ingrained within the minds of employers and across wider society.""Our welfare reforms are increasing the support and incentives for people to move into work, while keeping an important safety net in place for those who need it.""In addition to ESA, we also offer support through Personal Independence Payments, to help with the extra costs associated with being disabled."""

Parliament is in the process of considering legislation which would give Theresa May the authority to notify the EU of the UK's intention to leave by the end of March.MPs overwhelmingly backed the bill on second reading on Wednesday. The latest legal challenge was brought by supporters of a so-called ""soft Brexit"" - which would see the UK remain a member of the EU's internal market.They include Peter Wilding, chairman of the pro-Europe pressure group British Influence, and lobbyist Adrian Yalland.The government claimed the case, which was heard by Lord Justice Lloyd Jones and Mr Justice Lewis, was unarguable since the existing EEA agreement would automatically cease to exist once the UK left the EU. Under the terms of the EEA, which first came into legal force in 1994, the EU's 28 members and three other signatories are bound to accept the free movement of people, services, goods and capital across their borders.A government spokesman welcomed Friday's decision.""As the prime minister has said, we will not be a member of the single market and we will be seeking a broad new partnership with the EU including a bold and ambitious free trade agreement,"" a spokesman said.Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage said the ruling was ""good news"".

""And I should say overall that... there's a lot we have yet to see about the detailed plans, including those for fiscal policy, for government spending and taxes and so forth, so we'll have to wait and see.""But so far, at the margin, yes, it's been positive for global sentiment, and for that reason, and to that extent, for us as well."""

Probably not, but I'm not sure anyone could,"" he said.""But we are getting better, and the government is taking strides to get its own house in order.""The weakest link in any cybersecurity clampdown remained people, Prof Woodward said.""There are still people who copy things they shouldn't on to laptops or people who decide to connect a nuclear power station to the internet,"" he said."

""Cutting spending on CPD, even in a time of tight budgets, would be one of the most counterproductive, short-sighted and evidence-averse things a school could do.""The deputy head of Quintin Kynaston school in north London, Ross McGill, said it was wrong for schools to be ""squeezed into a corner, forced to make a decision to cut, or have no continuous professional development budget available to their staff"". He said that the staff development budget was ""always the first thing to be cut when unplanned financial circumstances arise throughout the academic year"".""With rapid reforms in curriculum, examinations and assessment, every school will need to invest a huge amount of time for all staff to be one step ahead of their students in class,"" he said.A Department for Education spokesman said: ""Continued professional development is vital for all teachers to help improve their knowledge and skills. ""Thanks to our investment in school funding, which at more than £40bn in 2016-17 is at its highest level on record, we are giving all schools access to the resources they need. ""We trust heads to make the right decisions for their staff and use those resources to invest in high quality training and development."""

2017-02-03,Major upgrade for UK growth outlook,https://web.archive.org//web/20170203123330/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-38841747,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe Bank of England has made another dramatic rise in its growth forecast for this year.It expects the economy to grow 2% in 2017, up from a November forecast of 1.4%, which was itself an upgrade from the 0.8% forecast made in August.The Bank also made a striking forecast about the savings rate, which it expects to fall to 4%, the lowest rate since the early 1960s.As expected the Bank kept interest rates on hold at 0.25%.The raised growth forecast follows much criticism levelled at the Bank for being too gloomy when it drastically cut its growth forecast after June's vote in favour of Brexit. Kamal Ahmed: Has the ""Brexit effect"" disappeared?""Domestic demand has been stronger than expected in the past few months, and there have been relatively few signs of the slowdown in consumer spending that the committee had anticipated following the referendum,"" the Bank said in its latest Quarterly Inflation Report.The Bank said the latest, improved forecast was partly the result of higher spending and investment contained in Chancellor Philip Hammond's Autumn Statement. It also credited stronger growth in the US and Europe, rising stock markets and the greater availability of credit for households, for its more optimistic outlook for the UK economy.However, the Bank still sees the economy slowing in 2018, when it expects growth of 1.6%.It blames that deceleration on an expected slowdown in spending by households as they adjust to higher inflation. The Bank thinks that income growth, when adjusted for inflation, will stall in 2017.It predicts ""a significant fall in the saving ratio over the next three years as consumers take time to adjust spending growth to weaker income flows"". The savings rate is expected to fall to 4%, the lowest rate since records began in the early 1960s.The erosion in consumer spending power is partly down to higher consumer price inflation, which the Bank forecasts running at 2% this year, slightly higher than its previous forecast of 1.8% made in November.Much of that inflation is the result of the weaker pound, which is making imported goods more expensive. The pound is still about 16% below the level seen before the referendum. In recent months it has fallen below $1.21 against the dollar, but has bounced off those lows. The Bank expects the weakness in the pound to propel inflation higher and it expects inflation of 2.7% next year, which is well above its target rate of 2%.Bank of England governor Mark Carney has said the Bank is prepared to tolerate inflation running above its target, but in the minutes from their latest meeting, members of the Monetary Policy Committee said they had moved ""a little closer"" to the limit of that toleration.Sterling fell sharply after the release of the Bank's inflation report. The pound dropped nearly a cent against the US dollar to below $1.26 as the markets interpreted the report as indicating that the Bank was in no rush to raise interest rates.  The Bank has also been surprised by the modest rises in wage growth. ""Pay growth, although edging up, has remained persistently subdued by historical standards - strikingly so in light of the decline in the rate of unemployment to below 5%,"" the Bank said in its report.Economic theory says that wages should be driven up when unemployment is low, but the Bank now thinks there is more slack in the economy than it previously thought and estimates the economy can run with unemployment at 4.5%, without sparking wage inflation.The Bank says it will be closely watching spending growth, if it slows more abruptly than expected ""there is scope for monetary policy to be loosened"". However, it warns that if pay growth picks up more than anticipated interest rates may have to be raised more sharply ""than the gently rising path"" implied by the financial markets.The financial markets are forecasting a 50% chance of a rise in interest rates this year and see a rise as almost certain before the end of 2018.During a press conference after publication of the report, Mr Carney said that Brexit issues would continue to hang over the economy.""The Brexit journey is really just beginning. While the direction of travel is clear, there will be twists and turns along the way,"" he said.""Consumers have not been affected by the uncertainty around Brexit.""However, he added that although the Bank had raised its growth forecast, this ""doesn't mean the referendum is without consequence"".""Uncertainty over future arrangements is weighing on business investment, which has been flat since the end of 2015,"" he told reporters.Mr Carney did, however, acknowledge that the Bank misjudged consumer confidence immediately after June's referendum.""The thing that we missed is the strength of consumer spending and consumer confidence associated with that,"" he said. ""After an initial wobble in terms of consumer surveys... it bounced back pretty quickly."""

Last October, after years of delay, the government said that building a third runway at Heathrow was its preferred option for expanding airport capacity.Mr Grayling told the Commons that a third runway would generate tens of thousands of jobs, and be a major boost to the economy as Britain prepares to leave the European Union.  ""By backing the north-west runway at Heathrow airport and publishing our proposals, we are sending a clear signal that when we leave the EU, we are open for business,"" Mr Grayling said.With the government about to set out its strategy for withdrawal from the EU in a White Paper, Mr Grayling said that a third runway at Heathrow would enhance the UK's global links.""Leaving the EU is a new chapter for Britain and provides us with a great opportunity to forge a new role in the world. We are determined to seize that opportunity and having the right infrastructure in place will allow us to build a more global Britain,"" he told MPs.Alongside his announcement of a ""draft policy statement"" on Heathrow expansion, Mr Grayling also issued a consultation document on improving Britain's air space infrastructure and investing in new technology.He said it made sense to carry out the two consultations together, which will run until 25 May, with the final decisions going before Parliament late this year or early 2018.The consultations on Heathrow and air traffic facilities will involve events across the country ""because the whole country will benefit,"" Mr Grayling said. He is due in Glasgow later to expand on how travellers and freight users outside the south east England will benefit.The cost of a third runway is estimated to be £22bn, and is forecast to generate about 70,000 jobs. An additional 260,000 take-offs or landings would be permitted each year from the expanded airport, on top of the current cap of 480,000.The consultation will consider such things as pollution, additional rail and road infrastructure such a roads, and the impact on surrounding towns and villages. But there is expected to be continued significant opposition to the third runway proposal.Earlier, Liberal Democrat MP for Richmond Park and North Kingston, Sarah Olney, accused the government of being ""so desperate"" to reassure businesses about its Brexit plans that it is ""willing to steamroller over those communities opposed to Heathrow expansion"".And John Stewart, chairman of anti-Heathrow expansion group Hacan, said it was important that the government assessed the consultation ""in an even-handed way"" and rejected the plan if the expected impact on issues such as noise was found to be ""too great"".The biggest long-term environmental challenge for aviation is climate change.The government says a rise in aviation carbon emissions alone is no reason to reject expansion - unless that increase is so great it risks breaching the government's overall carbon targets.But the government's official advisers, the Committee on Climate Change, previously warned that's exactly what's likely to happen.They say growth in aviation emissions will mean ministers have to squeeze even deeper emissions cuts from other sectors of the economy.They are already struggling to meet carbon targets in heating and transport and the committee says it has ""very limited confidence"" that sectors like steel-making and heavy industry can cut emissions even more to accommodate people flying.Follow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin"

2017-02-03,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20170203123330/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThis article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide to the UK's vote to leave the European Union. It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 52% to 48%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%, as did Wales, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who resigned on the day after losing the referendum. Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she says she will respect the will of the people. She has said ""Brexit means Brexit"" but there is still a lot of debate about what that will mean in practice especially on the two key issues of how British firms do business in the European Union and what curbs are brought in on the rights of European Union nationals to live and work in the UK. She set out more details of her negotiating hopes in her key speech on Brexit.The UK economy appears to have weathered the initial shock of the Brexit vote, although the value of the pound remains near a 30-year low, but opinion is sharply divided over the long-term effects of leaving the EU. Some major firms such as Easyjet and John Lewis have pointed out that the slump in sterling has increased their costs. Britain also lost its top AAA credit rating, meaning the cost of government borrowing will be higher. But share prices have recovered from a dramatic slump in value, with both the FTSE 100 and the broader FTSE 250 index, which includes more British-based businesses, trading higher than before the referendum. The Bank of England cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - a record low and the first cut since 2009 - after the vote and there has not been the economic slump or recession that some had predicted. Here is a regularly updated detailed rundown of how Britain's economy is doingThe European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it has to invoke an agreement called Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May has said she intends to trigger this process by the end of March 2017, meaning the UK will be expected to have left by the summer of 2019, depending on the precise timetable agreed during the negotiations. The government will also enact a Great Repeal Bill which will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. It is expected to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove.After a court battle, the UK's Supreme Court has ruled that Parliament must be consulted before Article 50 is invoked. This is why a two line Brexit bill is currently making its way through Parliament. MPs and Lords have to vote on it.The court verdict was not what the government argued for, but ministers have insisted it will not delay their planned timetable.Most MPs are expected to vote in favour of Article 50 being triggered, although there could be attempts to amend the draft legislation.Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These men - dubbed the Three Brexiteers - will play a central role in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although it will be Mrs May, as prime minister, who will have the final say. The government did not do any emergency planning for Brexit ahead of the referendum and Mrs May has rejected calls to say what her negotiating goals are.Once Article 50 has been triggered, the UK will have two years to negotiate its withdrawal. But no one really knows how the Brexit process will work - Article 50 was only created in late 2009 and it has never been used. Former Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, now Chancellor, wanted Britain to remain in the EU, and he has suggested it could take up to six years for the UK to complete exit negotiations. The terms of Britain's exit will have to be agreed by 27 national parliaments, a process which could take some years, he has argued. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. The UK will continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making.Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Following Theresa May's Brexit recent speech we now know that the UK is not intending to stay in the EU's single market. Although there has been speculation for months about the issue, it would have meant the UK staying under the auspices of the European Court of Justice and having to allow unlimited EU immigration, under freedom of movement rules.Both sides want trade to continue after Brexit with the UK seeking a positive outcome for those who wish to trade goods and services"" - such as those in the City of London and wanting a ""comprehensive free trade deal"" giving the UK ""the greatest possible access"" to the single market. Mrs May says she wants the UK to reach a new customs union deal with the EU. A customs union is where countries agree not to impose tariffs on each others' goods and have a common tariff on goods coming in from elsewhere. The UK is currently part of the EU customs union but that stops the UK being able to do its own trade deals with other countries. Reality Check: How could customs union work?These terms have increasingly been used as debate focused on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people in order to maintain access to the EU single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result.The government has declined to give a firm guarantee about the status of EU nationals currently living in the UK, saying this is not possible without a reciprocal pledge from other EU members about the millions of British nationals living on the continent. EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, will be be able to stay, the chief civil servant at the Home Office has said. The rights of other EU nationals would be subject to negotiations on Brexit and the ""will of Parliament"", he added.A lot depends on the kind of deal the UK agrees with the EU. If it remains within the single market, it would almost certainly retain free movement rights, allowing UK citizens to work in the EU and vice versa. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.Again, it depends on whether the UK government decides to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages. Citizens' Advice has reminded people their rights have not changed yet and asked anyone to contact them if they think they have been discriminated against following the Leave vote.Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested EU migrants who come to the UK as Brexit nears may not be given the right to stay. He has said there might have to be a cut-off point if there was a ""surge"" in new arrivals.People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote.The day-to-day spending impact is likely to be more significant. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it to remain at least 10% below where it was on 23 June, in the long term. This means imported goods will consequently get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have already been seen and the issue was most notably illustrated by the dispute between Tesco and Marmite's makers about whether prices would be put up or not in the stores.The latest UK inflation figures, for December, showed the CPI inflation rate jumping to 1.6%, its highest level for two years with signs of more cost pressures set to feed through in the months to come.Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration.She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations. As mentioned above, the key issue is whether other EU nations will grant the UK access to the single market, if that is what it wants, while at the same time being allowed to restrict the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK.Mrs May has said she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. It is currently running at 330,000 a year, of which 184,000 are EU citizens, and 188,000 are from outside the EU - the figures include a 39,000 outflow of UK citizens.It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Liberal Democrats - who have just a handful of MPs - have vowed to halt Brexit and keep Britain in the EU if they were to win the next general election.Some commentators, including former House of Commons clerk Lord Lisvane, have argued that a further referendum would be needed to ratify whatever deal the UK hammers out with the EU, but there are few signs political leaders view this as a viable option.Yes. Theresa May has appeared keen to avoid a vote on her negotiating stance, to avoid having to give away her priorities, but Theresa May has said there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. It is worth mentioning that any deal also has to be agreed by the European Parliament - with British MEPs getting a chance to vote on it there.  While there could be limitations on British nationals' ability to live and work in EU countries, it seems unlikely they would want to deter tourists. There are many countries outside the European Economic Area, which includes the 28 EU nations plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway, that British citizens can visit for up to 90 days without needing a visa and it is possible that such arrangements could be negotiated with European countries.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. In theory, the government could, if it wanted, decide to change the colour, which is currently standardised for EU countries, says the BBC's Europe correspondent, Chris Morris.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketNo nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it is ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faces being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. A second independence referendum for the country is now ""highly likely"", she has said, although not in 2017. She has said she wants Scotland to stay in the single market and said Mrs May's decision to rule out the UK staying in the single market ""undoubtedly"" brings the referendum closer.Before his resignation Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said the impact in Northern Ireland would be ""very profound"" and that the whole island of Ireland should now be able to vote on reunification. But, speaking while she was still Northern Ireland Secretary, Theresa Villiers ruled out the call from Sinn Féin for a border poll, saying the circumstances in which one would be called did not exist. The land border is likely to be a key part of the Brexit talks. Theresa May said a priority for her would be negotiating a deal with the EU which allowed a common travel area between the UK and the Republic of Ireland.During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest. But his successor Theresa May has said she will keep it in place, at least for the current Parliament, which is due to last until 2020.So far there has been a cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. There are yet to be signs that rising inflation have worried the Bank of England  enough to consider raising interest rates.  But if that happened it would make mortgages and loans more expensive to repay - but would be good news for savers.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.Eurotunnel boss Jacques Gounon said last November the reintroduction of duty-free would be ""an incredible boost for my business"" but he later said  that remark had been ""light-hearted"". Erik Juul-Mortensen, president of the Tax Free World Association (TFWA) said after the referendum vote ""it is not possible to predict how Brexit will affect the duty free and travel retail industry, and it is wiser not to make assumptions about exactly what the impact will be.""  They are at the moment but no-one knows the longer term prospects for definite. The EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - is not an EU initiative. It was negotiated between countries within a group known as the European Economic Area, often simply referred to as the single market (plus Switzerland, which confusingly is not a member of the EEA, but has agreed access to the single market). Therefore, the future of Britons' EHIC cover could depend on whether the UK decided to sever ties with the EEA.Probably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report. In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two-thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.However, the UK government is committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, the UK government is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR. However, the EU has its own European Court of Justice, whose decisions are binding on EU institutions and member states.Its rulings have sometimes caused controversy in Britain and supporters of a Brexit have called for immediate legislation to curb its powers. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also cited sovereignty and democracy, and they wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Four of the biggest US banks have committed to helping maintain the City's position. But HSBC will move up to 1,000 jobs to Paris, the BBC understands. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Pest control firm Rentokil Initial says it could make £15m extra this year thanks to a weaker currency.Others are less optimistic. Hilary Jones, a director at UK cosmetics firm Lush said the company was ""terrified"" about the economic impact. She added that while the firm's Dorset factory would continue to produce goods for the UK market, products for the European market may be made at its new plant in Germany.Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After the Leave vote, the government will probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""As with most elements of the UK economy, not enough solid data has been published yet to accurately conclude the Brexit effect on house prices. Industry figures have pointed to ""uncertainty"" among buyers and sellers that could potentially change the housing market.So far, the most significant research has come from the respected Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which has published the conclusions of a survey of its members. This primarily records sentiment among surveyors.It found that house prices are expected to fall across the UK in the three months after the referendum vote. However, the dip in prices is only expected to persist over the 12 months from June in London and East Anglia, surveyors predict.House prices were already slowing in central London, owing to the fall-out from changes to stamp duty rules in April.Separate figures from property portal Rightmove suggested the average asking price of houses coming on to the market in England and Wales fell by 0.9%, or £2,647, in July compared with June. It said that agents had reported very few sales had fallen through as a result of the vote.Many potential first-time buyers would welcome a fall in house prices, with ownership among the young falling owing to affordability concerns. Investors in property, or those who have paid off a mortgage and hope to leave homes as inheritance would be unhappy with a long-term reduction in value.  Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law following the decision to leave the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" will not necessarily disappear overnight - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU means the UK will not be part of TTIP. It will have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Former Labour health secretary Lord Owen has said that because of TTIP (see answer above) the only way to protect the NHS from further privatisation was to get out of the EU."

After decades of debate, years of acrimony over the issue in the Conservative Party, months of brutal brinksmanship in Westminster, and hours of debate this week, MPs have just approved the very first step in the process of Britain leaving the European Union. There are many hurdles ahead, probably thousands of hours of debate here, years of negotiations for Theresa May with our friends and rivals around the EU, as she seeks a deal - and possibly as long as a decade of administrative adjustments, as the country extricates itself from the EU. On a wet Wednesday, the debate didn't feel epoch-making, but think for a moment about what has just happened. MPs, most of whom wanted to stay in the EU, have just agreed that we are off.  This time last year few in Westminster really thought that this would happen. The then prime minister's concern was persuading the rest of the EU to give him a better deal for the UK. His close colleagues believed the chances of them losing, let alone the government dissolving over the referendum, were slim, if not quite zero.Then tonight, his former colleagues are rubber stamping the decision of a narrow majority of the public, that changed everything in politics here for good. This isn't even the  last vote on this bill. There are several more stages, the Lords are likely to kick up rough at the start. But after tonight, for better or worse, few will believe that our journey to the exit door can be halted.As government ministers have said in recent days, the moment for turning back is past. "
2017-02-03,Brexit debate notes,https://web.archive.org//web/20170203123330/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-parliaments-38833310,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkI've got five take-outs from the Article 50 bill so far.There may be 101 pages of amendments down so far, but the government is in no mood to take any of them on board; on the contrary, their aim is to repel boarders, to the point where they would even resist the one amendment being mooted by the Brexiteer camp, which would aim to forbid ministers from accepting any extra time to extend the two year negotiating window specified by the EU's Lisbon Treaty. Ministers do believe that the EU's Michel Barnier's strategy is to enmesh the UK in a long-term negotiating limbo, perhaps including a post-Brexit transitional deal, but they don't want their hands tied.Many of the amendments, thus far, look like the product of an amendment generating bot, standard stuff about laying reports and regular debates. But ministers are wary of some of the substantive ones setting conditions - and in particular of the emotive issue of EU nationals resident in Britain, a matter now featuring regularly in most MPs' constituency surgeries. There is strong pressure for some kind of unilateral move for the UK to guarantee their right to remain - but, the government retorts, if that was passed, its backers would be to blame if one or two European states didn't reciprocate and allow UK nationals to stay within their borders.In the debate, Labour's frontbench Brexit spokesman, Sir Keir Starmer, looked and sounded like a lawyer delivering a plea in mitigation on behalf of a convicted prisoner. Early in his speech, he appealed to the Commons for a courteous hearing - something his opposite number, David Davis, would never have got away with. It just about worked, because the House genuinely wanted to hear what he had to say, but he does suffer from the lawyer-turned politician's tendency to address MPs as if they were the Court of Appeal. But leaving aside the style points, forging a line on Brexit which can stitch together the strongly pro-Brexit and strongly pro-Remain elements of Labour's heartland, let alone unify the deeply divided Parliamentary Labour Party, may prove an impossible challenge.Whether it's in the leadership ratings in Conservative Home, where he has now edged ahead of the prime minister herself, or in the growls of approval from his colleagues in the regular statements in the chamber, the Brexit Secretary, David Davis, increasingly commands the status of second minister in this government. This is not a wholly comfortable place to be - flying perilously near to the Sun - but as someone reconciled, not that long ago, to seeing out their parliamentary career on the backbenches, I suspect Mr Davis can bear it. The Lib Dems have sought to position themselves as the last champions of the Remain cause (although two of their MPs, Norman Lamb and Greg Mulholland have promised to abstain on the Article 50 Bill). But they can't claim to be the arch-opponents of Brexit and fail to maintain a presence for the big debates on it - and their leader, Tim Farron, had a chastening time at PMQs when this was pointed out. In truth, their much-reduced parliamentary party has been pretty bad at showing the flag, since the last election. It's rare to see all nine Lib Dem MPs on the green benches. This is one area where they are not very good at remaining. "

Few world leaders can resist the siren lure of all that royal bling: horse-drawn coaches, state banquets, processions down the Mall, the sheer scale of all that gold leaf and pomp and flummery that allows them a brief window into a royal fantasy that many countries envy but can rarely match. This weapon is deployed sparingly, normally no more than twice a year. But it does get used. If Donald Trump does touch down for a little red carpet treatment later this year, it will be the 110th time the Queen has welcomed another head of state to these shores in her reign. And for now, despite the protests and growing online petition, Downing Street is continuing to stand firm, insisting that the invitation to the president stands.So state visits are not merely ceremonial affairs, they are political and purposeful. They are used by the British government of the day to further what they see as Britain's national interests. In 1973, the Queen welcomed President Mobutu of what was then called Zaire in Africa, now the Democratic Republic of Congo. He was a brutal, corrupt dictator but he was also seen as a vital anti-communist ally in the Cold War against the Soviet Union. So he got an invite to the Palace. President Suharto of Indonesia, another repressive leader who happened to be anti-communist, was also granted a state visit in 1979 for the same reasons.In 1971, Emperor Hirohito of Japan was welcomed by the Queen for a state visit as a deliberate attempt to help usher the country back into the family of nations after its post-war isolation. Not surprisingly, the invitation of the man who had led Japan during World War Two was hugely controversial, and many former army veterans and prisoners of war turned their backs on the royal procession in silent protest. Some wore red gloves to symbolise the blood they saw as being on his hands while others whistled ribald old army tunes. A tree the Emperor had planted was uprooted.In 1978, Nicolae Ceausescu, the notorious Romanian communist leader, and his wife Elena were given a state visit in the vain hope that they might be encouraged to introduce some pro-Western reforms. The Queen was so repulsed by them that, according to the royal author Robert Hardman, while out walking her dogs, she hid behind a bush in the Palace gardens to avoid bumping into the couple who were also out strolling. More than a decade later both Ceausescu and his wife were executed by a revolutionary firing squad.And even the most uncontroversial of state visits, that of President Mandela in 1996, was not without political purpose. There was a feeling in the Foreign Office that South Africa was beginning to slip away from the West towards the unaligned nations, and they wanted to hug Madiba close and remind his country of Britain's anti-apartheid credentials.More recently, in 2014, the state visit of the Irish president to Britain was used as another step of reconciliation. Martin McGuiness, the former Northern Ireland deputy first minister and former IRA leader, not only put on white tie and tails for a state banquet at Windsor Castle, but he also stood for a toast to the Queen. And the state visit of President Xi in 2015 was a deliberate attempt by George Osborne, the then Chancellor, to curry favour with the Chinese and boost British trade links.As for American presidents, only two have been granted full state visits during the current Queen's reign: President Bush in 2003 and President Obama in 2011.What is unusual is the speed with which Mr Trump has been issued with an invitation for a state visit, just days into his presidency. Both Messrs Bush and Obama had to wait until well into their terms of office before they got the call. The haste reflects the importance the prime minister places on securing a good relationship with the new president and winning a post-Brexit trade deal, even if there is some political cost. Mr Bush's visit was by no means uncontroversial, coming so soon after the beginning of the Iraq war. There were demonstrations throughout the trip, including one involving tens of thousands in central London when an effigy of the president was toppled over in a parody of events in Baghdad. So the Queen may be above politics but state visits are not. They are used for diplomacy and are often controversial. And whatever protests may surround any Trump state visit, the Queen will have seen it all before. Rarely has she shown herself unable to cope with whomsoever the government brings round for tea. As one royal insider told me dryly: ""She does have some experience in these matters.""Or as former foreign secretary William Hague wrote more bluntly in the Telegraph this morning, ""A Queen who has been asked over the decades to host tyrants such as Presidents Mobutu of Zaire and Ceausescu of Romania is going to take a brash billionaire from New York effortlessly in her stride.""

2017-02-03,By-election battle,https://web.archive.org//web/20170203123330/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38808154,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkCould voters who chose to leave the EU at the referendum propel UKIP to victory in Stoke-on-Trent Central?A whopping 69% of the electorate across Stoke chose Leave at the EU referendum. A paltry 50% bothered to vote in the constituency at the general election.If UKIP can get out the leavers they can win, or so goes the theory. As it happens both the Labour and Conservative candidates voted Remain at the referendum.Labour's man Gareth Snell even published a rude poem on Twitter about Brexit's flaws. To add to the fun, he has been just as rude about Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell on Twitter.When I ask him if Labour's leader would make a good prime minister he gives an unusually nuanced answer for a candidate: ""Jeremy is the leader of our party. I will campaign for whoever the leader of our party is to be prime minister. ""If that's Jeremy I'll do all I can to make sure he steps through the door of 10 Downing Street.""A UKIP victory here would make good the long-held theory of party leader and candidate Paul Nuttall that his party can defeat Labour in parliamentary elections.Winning a seat at Westminster for himself would also see him triumph where his predecessor Nigel Farage failed. No wonder there's a glint in his eye.The idea of a UKIP win fits the key themes of the moment: Labour struggling, opposition to mainstream parties thriving. But that's why we should be cautious.Let's start with a confession: by-election speculation is grounded on even fewer facts than chatter about national politics. Rather than having those national polls about which we're so sceptical, we have no worthwhile polling at all.Candidates reporting the universally warm reception they have received on the doorstep are taking part in a grand tradition, but offering no evidence.UKIP's performance in by-elections since 2015 has been underwhelming; their best result in a parliamentary contest was a 3% improvement in their vote in Oldham West.In council by elections since September they've held one seat and made one gain from Labour, lost two to the Conservatives and one to the Lib Dems. It's not much of a surge.While the Conservatives are thought to have a much better chance in the by-election in Copeland, they ran UKIP close in Stoke in 2015.Their candidate Jack Brereton sticks with unerring consistency to a handful of talking points, brooking little deviation and plenty of repetition.Why did he vote to remain at the referendum? ""I voted Remain and I've been open and honest about that because - um - but we need to get beyond that, it's about now delivering Brexit,"" he answers.If it's a maddening (for an interviewer) habit to acquire aged 25 it's also the habit of someone who has already become a Tory council cabinet member in a Labour area.Labour's Snell meanwhile is a borough councillor, and argues that while local voters are concerned about Brexit they want to know what plan the prime minister has for jobs and investment in Stoke. On this topic he sounds more sure-footed.UKIP's Nuttall is frank about his tactics. He says: ""If we turn this into a referendum on Brexit we win this seat. It really is as simple as that. The Liberal Democrats did it in Richmond which is a big Remain seat. If we do the same we're in with a really good chance.""Those Liberal Democrats are making their play for the 30% of the vote that rejected Brexit and could woo Labour voters unconvinced by Corbyn, although their candidate Dr Zulfiqar Ali saw his vote plunge 17.5% at the last general election.Bizarrely, in the right places UKIP and the Lib Dems share a strategy - trying to fight out the referendum again on opposing sides and playing to the passions of the politics it left in its wake. UKIP have money - privately they expect to hit the spending limit - and seem to be better organised in Stoke than in other recent contests. The idea that they can use this moment to prise Labour's traditional support away certainly rattles many in Corbyn's party.Shadow cabinet members talk grimly about the idea many voters now identify more with people who vote as they did at the referendum than with those who voted like them at the general election.A compelling fight in Stoke-on-Trent then, but one in its earliest stages. Anyone forecasting the outcome with certainty is placing great store by precedent, doorstep sentiment or hunch.The nomination deadline is 16:00 BST on 31 January.Here is a list of the candidates declared so far:"
2017-02-03,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20170203123330/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38797243,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe claim: The six strongest pro-Leave constituencies and the six strongest pro-Remain constituencies all have Labour MPs.Reality Check verdict: The best estimates available suggest that two of the six most pro-Remain constituencies have SNP MPs, while three of the six most pro-Leave constituencies have Conservative MPs.Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said on Friday that any leader would be challenged by the situation in which the six most passionate pro-Leave and pro-Remain constituencies all had MPs from their party.The EU referendum vote nationwide was close, with 48.1% voting Remain and 51.9% Leave.But Remain voters tended to be clustered in big cities and in Scotland and Northern Ireland, while the Leave vote was more evenly spread.This means that while a small majority of the country voted Leave, a large majority of the country's 650 parliamentary constituencies did so.The votes in June were counted by council, of which there are far fewer - about 400. This is because cities tend to have one council but several Westminster constituencies.This means in most cases we cannot say exactly how each parliamentary constituency voted.  However, Chris Hanretty, an academic at the University of East Anglia, has used the results for local authorities to make detailed estimates for each constituency.These are based on other things we know about the area, such as age, education, ethnicity and income, and how strongly those factors correlate with a vote for Brexit in the places where we know the vote at constituency level for sure.Mr Hanretty estimates that most constituencies where Remain support was the highest did indeed vote Labour in 2015, although Glasgow North and Edinburgh North, both represented by the SNP, are exceptions.But that's not the picture in the areas that most passionately backed Leave.The Brexit vote was strongest in parts of eastern England, especially Lincolnshire, which backed the Conservatives in 2015.Mr Hanretty estimates that Conservative-held Boston and Skegness was the constituency with the highest Leave vote.It covers the Boston council area, which recorded the strongest vote to leave the EU of any local authority, and part of East Lindsey, another overwhelmingly pro-Brexit area.It's true that some places where Leave support was strongest voted Labour in 2015, such as Doncaster North, Ed Miliband's constituency. But the Leave vote was highest in Conservative parts of eastern England.Read more from Reality Check"

The veteran Gaullist already has form.When he was Commissioner for the Internal Market and Financial Services, Mr Barnier was dubbed ""the most dangerous man in Europe"" after taking on the banking sector and championing a cap on bankers' bonuses. But while he alarmed some in the City, and will probably do so again, he also won grudging respect as a tough but even-handed negotiator.He will need all those skills and more in his new role - chief Brexit negotiator at the European Commission. And having moved seamlessly between big jobs in Paris and Brussels - French foreign minister, Commissioner, MEP - he looks well prepared. ""Don't ask me to tell you what will be at the end of the road, we haven't begun to walk yet,"" he told a conference in Brussels last month. Mr Barnier will stick closely to the official EU position of ""no negotiation without notification"" - waiting for the UK to trigger Article 50 to start the formal process of withdrawal. But he's clearly eager to get going.""I am waiting to begin,"" he said. ""I will be ready tomorrow to negotiate, frankly speaking.""And he will bring with him an instinctive pro-European agenda, and a deep knowledge of the workings of the single market.His deputy as chief Brexit negotiator is a German trade expert, Sabine Weyand, adding to the impression that Mr Barnier will lead a team that means business.One of the biggest challenges he (and his boss Jean-Claude Juncker) faces, is to ensure that representatives of the big member states don't sideline him in the Brexit divorce negotiations.But Mr Barnier's long career in French politics means he could well have the ear of the Elysee Palace, especially if - as looks likely - a centre-right candidate wins the French presidency next year. The stakes are so high that there are bound to be some clashes.Mr Barnier has sparred with the UK's Minister for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, before, when the men both served as Europe ministers in the 1990s. It is another reminder that Michel Barnier is a politician first and foremost, rather than a bureaucrat. There have certainly been criticisms - a dash of vanity, a lack of attention to detail. His career has had plenty of downs as well as ups.But he will defend his European vision to the end, and the British government would do well not to underestimate him.At the height of the eurozone crisis, Mr Barnier always refused (politely) to do broadcast interviews in English.""One wrong word,"" he told me once with a smile, ""and we could move markets.""The next few years will be equally challenging."

Scotland voted 62% in favour of Remain.The conversation online was being driven overwhelmingly by pro-independence campaigners. But people who had supported ""Better Together"" during the Scottish referendum vote also spoke about the possibility of a break-away from the UK as a result of the vote over EU membership.  Perhaps the most significant was Scottish author JK Rowling who tweeted: ""Scotland will seek independence now. Cameron's legacy will be breaking up two unions. Neither needed to happen.""Many took to Twitter to express new or strengthened pro-independence feelings in the wake of the latest vote (Just as a reminder: a ""Yes"" vote in Scotland's 2014 referendum was for independence, while the winning ""No"" campaign backed staying in the UK).One old tweet from 2014's independence referendum gained new life on Friday.

2017-02-04,Labour promises cap on energy price rises,https://web.archive.org//web/20170205051606/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38858225,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkLabour has promised to place a cap on the prices charged by energy companies if it wins power.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell made the commitment to the BBC a day after Npower said it was raising electricity prices by 15% from March.Meanwhile, Mr McDonnell used a speech earlier to vow to ""close the gap"" between spending in the north and south of England.But the Conservatives said Labour's plans would ""crash the economy"".  Npower said on Friday that its price rises would take effect on 16 March, with gas increasing by 4.8%. The company said the changes would only affect about half of its customers, but energy regulator Ofgem said it must ""justify"" why it was introducing one of the largest price rises in years. Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Mr McDonnell said people would be paying for the increase having had their wages ""frozen"" since the recession.Asked what Labour would do, he said it would introduce legislation that would limit the amount prices could increase by. ""This is huge. We can't allow this to keep going on,"" he said. Speaking later at Labour's economic conference in Liverpool, Mr McDonnell said the North had consistently lost out in terms of spending - and promised a future Labour government would try to rectify that. He cited figures from the National Infrastructure Commission suggesting projected capital spending per head of population in the north of England would increase by just £1,491 by 2020-2021, compared with by £3,114 per head in London. ""We have to put an end to the Whitehall view that what's good for the City of London is good for the country as a whole,"" he said.""It is time for the rest of the country to get a look-in.""Pledging to create a ""Crossrail for the North"", Mr McDonnell said the high-speed line would reduce journey times between Manchester, Liverpool and Leeds and create 850,000 additional jobs by 2050. The proposed HS3 line was approved in the government's March 2016 Budget but Labour says the government has still not brought forward a definite plan for the scheme. Mr McDonnell also said a Labour government would pass laws requiring ministers to audit capital spending in the English regions against their relative economic need and to report any disparities to Parliament.The government has earmarked £13bn on transport in the North and £19bn in total capital spending for the region. It has created Transport for the North - a new body to co-ordinate transport investment in the region, modelled on Transport for London - and has accepted all its recommendations to improve connectivity.Its plans include an accelerated upgrade of the M62, major improvements to junctions on the M1 and M56, investments in leading stations and £1.2bn to increase capacity on the Northern and TransPennine rail routes.A Conservative spokesman said Labour's borrowing plans ""would crash our economy and threaten jobs and infrastructure""."
2017-02-04,Merkel hails May's hopes for a strong EU,https://web.archive.org//web/20170205051606/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38849868,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkGerman chancellor Angela Merkel has welcomed Theresa May's remarks that Britain wants to see a strong Europe - even as it prepares to quit the EU.The prime minister told EU leaders she wanted to build a ""strong partnership"" with the EU and pledged the UK would be a ""good friend and ally"" post-Brexit.But Mrs May was forced to defend her decision to seek a close relationship with US President Donald Trump.EU leaders have voiced concern over his perceived hostility towards the union.Mrs May used a summit of EU Nato leaders in the Maltese capital of Valletta to build alliances ahead of Brexit and to brief her counterparts about her recent visit to the White House to meet Mr Trump.She pledged a further £30m to help with the EU migrant crisis, with the UK providing medical care, temporary shelter and legal support to 60,000 refugees in Greece, Egypt and across the Balkans, while helping to reunite up to 22,000 people with their families.As well as assisting those who want to return home, the UK is offering to work with countries in Asia and Latin America that are willing to welcome refugees but do not have adequate infrastructure in place at present. While Mrs May did not have a formal bilateral meeting with Mrs Merkel, the two leaders did have a ""lengthy discussion"" during a walk through Valletta ahead of a working lunch.The German chancellor told reporters afterwards: ""I am pleased that Theresa May says that she wants a strong Europe.""It's up to us, as the 27, to determine how strong and how good and how rigorous Europe is and how we solve our problems - and Germany wants to do its part on that.""During talks with Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy and Austria's Christian Kern, Mrs May promised that the UK would remain a ""reliable partner"" after Brexit.Mr Rajoy said Mrs May's speech setting out the UK's Brexit plans, including quitting the single market, had ""clarified many things"" and given a greater degree of certainty.""They agreed that it was important to think about the future relationship as well as the detailed exit arrangement, so that we can give greater certainty for people and businesses who want to live and work in each other's countries,"" a Downing Street source said.They also agreed an early deal on the rights of EU citizens in the UK and Britons in the rest of Europe was desirable.Mrs May's visit comes two days after MPs voted to allow her to get Brexit negotiations under way.Malta's prime minister Joseph Muscat said while he wants a ""fair deal"" for the UK after Brexit, it must be ""inferior"" to full EU membership.Mrs May also used the summit to add her weight to President Trump's call for European Nato members to meet the target of spending a minimun of 2% of GDP on defence - a mark the UK is one of the few alliance members to meet.Nato estimates for 2016 show the US, Greece, Poland and Estonia are the only other countries who will fulfil the requirements.The BBC's deputy political editor John Pienaar says it was a tough ask for many European countries, because it would mean doubling their defence expenditure.And European leaders have expressed concern about Mr Trump's comments about the EU and the US ban on refugees and visa holders from a number of mainly Muslim countries. They are also anxious about the man tipped to be Mr Trump's EU ambassador, Ted Malloch, who has suggested the union needed to be ""tamed"".As part of efforts to build a bridge between Washington and Europe, Mrs May said the president's commitment to her about being ""100% behind Nato"" underlines the importance of defence and security co-operation. But Mr Muscat, whose country holds the rotating European Council presidency, said while there were concerns about some of the decisions that are being taken by the new US administration ""there was no sense of anti-Americanism"" among the 28 EU members.""There was a sense that we need to engage with the United States just the same, but that we need to show that we cannot stay silent where there are principles involved,"" he said.""As in any good relationship, we will speak very clearly where we think that those principles are being trampled on.""European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker said while he did not feel threatened by Mr Trump ""there is room for explanations because of the impression the new administration does not know the EU in detail - but in Europe details matter"".Mr Kern said: ""Today we have pretty mixed feelings, to be honest, because the tangible aspects of Mr Trump's policies are raising some concerns.""It's not a threat, it could be a catalyst for a strong, more united Europe. It is an alarm call to see if we are on the right track."" "
2017-02-04,Judges block fresh Brexit challenge,https://web.archive.org//web/20170205051606/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38854095,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkA fresh legal challenge to Brexit has been blocked by the High Court.A group of campaigners who want Britain to stay in the EU single market argued that Parliament must approve the UK's exit from the European Economic Area.But the judges refused to give the green light for the challenge, saying the judicial review was ""premature"".The Supreme Court ruled last month that Parliament must have its say before the government can trigger Article 50 and begin official talks on leaving the EU. Parliament is in the process of considering legislation which would give Theresa May the authority to notify the EU of the UK's intention to leave by the end of March.MPs overwhelmingly backed the bill on second reading on Wednesday. The latest legal challenge was brought by supporters of a so-called ""soft Brexit"" - which would see the UK remain a member of the EU's internal market.They include Peter Wilding, chairman of the pro-Europe pressure group British Influence, and lobbyist Adrian Yalland.The government claimed the case was unarguable since the existing EEA agreement would automatically cease to exist once the UK left the EU. Under the terms of the EEA, which first came into legal force in 1994, the EU's 28 members and three other signatories are bound to accept the free movement of people, services, goods and capital across their borders.Dismissing the case, Lord Justice Lloyd Jones and Mr Justice Lewis said the government had not made a decision ""as to the mechanism by which the EEA agreement would cease to apply within the UK"".As a result, they said it was not clear at this stage what issues, if any, would fall within the jurisdiction of the courts. In a joint statement, Mr Wilding and Mr Yalland suggested the government had ""used procedure"" to thwart them. They said they would not rule out bringing further proceedings to give all those who would be directly affected by Brexit some form of legal certainty about their rights.

2017-02-04,Northern schools 'need urgent attention',https://web.archive.org//web/20170205051606/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-38854271,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this link""Urgent attention"" must be given to improving education in the North of England, says George Osborne's Northern Powerhouse Partnership think tank. In its first report since being set up last year, the think tank identifies what needs to be done to ""build a Northern Powerhouse"". ""Many issues have been raised with us,"" said the authors, ""but one challenge stood out: education.""Labour said George Osborne's policies as chancellor had harmed the North. Mr Osborne said the region was ""at a turning point"". He set up the think tank last September to champion the ideas he had pursued as chancellor. Launching the report, Mr Osborne said: ""We can either make use of the momentum behind the Northern Powerhouse to really close the North-South gap, or we can let the moment pass and leave our country divided and the North left behind,"" he added. The report recommends urgent attention be given to improving the performance and aspiration of the North's schools and the quality of adult skills, along with better transport and broadband provision and more ambitious local decision making. The aim is to transform the economy of the North of England, said Mr Osborne. The initiative has already ""shifted the North into a new gear"", he said.""We can either make use of the momentum behind the Northern Powerhouse to really close the North-South gap - or we can let the moment pass and leave our country divided and the North left behind. ""Get it right and the northern economy will be £100bn bigger, with more jobs and higher living standards for all.""Ofsted's annual report , published in December, also identified poorly performing schools in the North and East Midlands as fuelling the sense of a divided nation. The outgoing chief inspector of schools, Sir Michael Wilshaw warned then that the economic future of the North relied on addressing poor performance in some schools. Mr Osborne said there was ""overwhelming evidence that attainment at 16 is too low in the North, leaving us lagging behind the UK and international competitors"".The region loses 30,000 graduates a year, according to the report, as students from northern universities move away after graduating. Mr Osborne said he would ask a group of leading employers and education leaders to work with the partnership ""to put this right"". In order to boost education and skills, the report recommends that the North works to: Northern Powerhouse Partnership board member Lord O'Neill agreed that improvements to infrastructure alone were not enough.  ""Something that also shines through in this report is that the education system in the North is not currently performing to its potential; in fact it is currently falling behind the South.""We need an education system that promotes and retains talent and we need to gain graduates, not lose them.""In response the government said it had launched the Northern Powerhouse Schools Strategy review and earmarked £70m to support educational improvement in the North. ""We have also named Scarborough, Oldham, Blackpool, Bradford and Doncaster as Opportunity Areas to benefit from additional funding and resources to promote social mobility,"" said a Department for Education spokesman. But shadow education secretary Angela Rayner said the think-tank report was ""all very well - but let's not forget that he was chancellor in a Tory government that presided over falling school budgets, a chronic teacher shortage and not enough good school places. ""The Tories' huge cuts to schools funding will hit schools in the North hard, making the problems highlighted in this report even worse. ""The Northern Powerhouse means nothing unless the government is prepared to invest in education, skills and infrastructure."" And Anne Longfield, children's commissioner for England, urged the think tank to consider ""why some parts of northern England have the best primary schools in the country, but lower attainment at secondary school and the lowest adult employment rates"". She promised that her own Growing Up North project, would suggest practical ways for the Northern Powerhouse to improve the lives of the region's children and young people. "
2017-02-04,Call for disability benefit cuts delay,https://web.archive.org//web/20170205051606/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-38846115,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkCuts in disability benefits should be delayed until the government clarifies how it will support those in need of extra money, a group of MPs has said.The Work and Pensions Select Committee found there was little evidence that lower payments would motivate disabled people to find work.The allowance is set to be reduced from £102 to £73 per week from April.Ministers have argued that savings would be invested in a new support package for the most vulnerable.The committee said evidence supporting the idea that introducing a lower rate of Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) would enhance incentives to work was ""ambiguous at best"".It welcomed a decision to make some severely disabled claimants exempt from repeated reassessment for ESA but said it had deep concerns about assessments proposed in the recent work and health green paper. The committee said ministers should consider using incentives such as reductions in National Insurance contributions to encourage employers to employ people with disabilities.Committee chairman Frank Field said: ""We expect the government to respond to this report before the proposed new lower rate of ESA is due in April.""If they intend to proceed with these cuts, we expect an explanation of how this will not be detrimental to its target of halving the disability employment gap, by making finding and keeping a job even more difficult for disabled people than it already is.""A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said: ""The number of disabled people in work has increased by almost 600,000 in the last three years, but we're determined to go even further.""Our Work and Health Green Paper marks the next stage of our action to confront the attitudes, prejudices and misunderstandings that have become ingrained within the minds of employers and across wider society.""Our welfare reforms are increasing the support and incentives for people to move into work, while keeping an important safety net in place for those who need it.""In addition to ESA, we also offer support through Personal Independence Payments, to help with the extra costs associated with being disabled."""

It is seeking to expand its sphere of influence, destabilise countries and weaken the alliance.""It is undermining national security for many allies and the international rules-based system.""Therefore it is in our interest and Europe's to keep Nato strong and to deter and dissuade Russia from this course.""Sir Michael backed US president Donald Trump's call for all Nato member states to honour the commitment to spend a minimum of 2% of GDP on defence.A Kremlin spokeman said: ""We're very disappointed that minister Fallon is so aggressively disposed, we are sure that such an accusation against our country is unfounded.""We don't see how a minister that has such a senior post can carry out such unfounded accusations that are based on nothing at all.""We hope that in time, Great Britain will in some way take a constructive approach that will lead to a normalisation in relations between our two countries."""

The latest estimated savings figures, released on Friday, which relate to 2015-16, are not official but are based on departmental reports and other supporting evidence.The savings drive has been underpinned by a shrinkage in the size of the government's property estate, with outdated buildings sold off and smaller departments sharing premises with larger ones. The 2012 sale of the famous Admiralty Arch building in central London, which is being turned into a hotel, yielded capital receipts of £66m this year. ""We have made significant steps forward in tackling fraud, selling off redundant government property such as the former Civil Service College in Sunningdale and making better use of modern digital technology to drive savings,"" said Cabinet Office Minister Ben Gummer.Mr Gummer acknowledged that meeting larger, long-term efficiency targets would depend on the ""total transformation"" of how government worked - requiring more public services to be delivered digitally.Tackling waste and fraud in the payment of benefits, tax credits and government grants has been a priority, as has the quicker recovery of debts. Figures released in December showed the amount of benefits not paid to those entitled to them owing to fraud and error rose had risen to a record £1.7bn. "

""And I should say overall that... there's a lot we have yet to see about the detailed plans, including those for fiscal policy, for government spending and taxes and so forth, so we'll have to wait and see.""But so far, at the margin, yes, it's been positive for global sentiment, and for that reason, and to that extent, for us as well."""

""Cutting spending on CPD, even in a time of tight budgets, would be one of the most counterproductive, short-sighted and evidence-averse things a school could do.""The deputy head of Quintin Kynaston school in north London, Ross McGill, said it was wrong for schools to be ""squeezed into a corner, forced to make a decision to cut, or have no continuous professional development budget available to their staff"". He said that the staff development budget was ""always the first thing to be cut when unplanned financial circumstances arise throughout the academic year"".""With rapid reforms in curriculum, examinations and assessment, every school will need to invest a huge amount of time for all staff to be one step ahead of their students in class,"" he said.A Department for Education spokesman said: ""Continued professional development is vital for all teachers to help improve their knowledge and skills. ""Thanks to our investment in school funding, which at more than £40bn in 2016-17 is at its highest level on record, we are giving all schools access to the resources they need.

It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 52% to 48%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%, as did Wales, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who resigned on the day after losing the referendum. Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she says she will respect the will of the people. She has said ""Brexit means Brexit"" but there is still a lot of debate about what that will mean in practice especially on the two key issues of how British firms do business in the European Union and what curbs are brought in on the rights of European Union nationals to live and work in the UK. She set out more details of her negotiating hopes in her key speech on Brexit.The UK economy appears to have weathered the initial shock of the Brexit vote, although the value of the pound remains near a 30-year low, but opinion is sharply divided over the long-term effects of leaving the EU. Some major firms such as Easyjet and John Lewis have pointed out that the slump in sterling has increased their costs. Britain also lost its top AAA credit rating, meaning the cost of government borrowing will be higher. But share prices have recovered from a dramatic slump in value, with both the FTSE 100 and the broader FTSE 250 index, which includes more British-based businesses, trading higher than before the referendum. The Bank of England cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - a record low and the first cut since 2009 - after the vote and there has not been the economic slump or recession that some had predicted. Here is a regularly updated detailed rundown of how Britain's economy is doingThe European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it has to invoke an agreement called Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May has said she intends to trigger this process by the end of March 2017, meaning the UK will be expected to have left by the summer of 2019, depending on the precise timetable agreed during the negotiations. The government will also enact a Great Repeal Bill which will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. It is expected to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove.After a court battle, the UK's Supreme Court has ruled that Parliament must be consulted before Article 50 is invoked. This is why a two line Brexit bill is currently making its way through Parliament. MPs and Lords have to vote on it.The court verdict was not what the government argued for, but ministers have insisted it will not delay their planned timetable.Most MPs are expected to vote in favour of Article 50 being triggered, although there could be attempts to amend the draft legislation.Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These men - dubbed the Three Brexiteers - will play a central role in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although it will be Mrs May, as prime minister, who will have the final say. The government did not do any emergency planning for Brexit ahead of the referendum and Mrs May has rejected calls to say what her negotiating goals are.Once Article 50 has been triggered, the UK will have two years to negotiate its withdrawal. But no one really knows how the Brexit process will work - Article 50 was only created in late 2009 and it has never been used. Former Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, now Chancellor, wanted Britain to remain in the EU, and he has suggested it could take up to six years for the UK to complete exit negotiations. The terms of Britain's exit will have to be agreed by 27 national parliaments, a process which could take some years, he has argued. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. The UK will continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making.Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Following Theresa May's Brexit recent speech we now know that the UK is not intending to stay in the EU's single market. Although there has been speculation for months about the issue, it would have meant the UK staying under the auspices of the European Court of Justice and having to allow unlimited EU immigration, under freedom of movement rules.Both sides want trade to continue after Brexit with the UK seeking a positive outcome for those who wish to trade goods and services"" - such as those in the City of London and wanting a ""comprehensive free trade deal"" giving the UK ""the greatest possible access"" to the single market. Mrs May says she wants the UK to reach a new customs union deal with the EU. A customs union is where countries agree not to impose tariffs on each others' goods and have a common tariff on goods coming in from elsewhere. The UK is currently part of the EU customs union but that stops the UK being able to do its own trade deals with other countries. Reality Check: How could customs union work?These terms have increasingly been used as debate focused on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people in order to maintain access to the EU single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result.The government has declined to give a firm guarantee about the status of EU nationals currently living in the UK, saying this is not possible without a reciprocal pledge from other EU members about the millions of British nationals living on the continent. EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, will be be able to stay, the chief civil servant at the Home Office has said. The rights of other EU nationals would be subject to negotiations on Brexit and the ""will of Parliament"", he added.A lot depends on the kind of deal the UK agrees with the EU. If it remains within the single market, it would almost certainly retain free movement rights, allowing UK citizens to work in the EU and vice versa. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.Again, it depends on whether the UK government decides to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages. Citizens' Advice has reminded people their rights have not changed yet and asked anyone to contact them if they think they have been discriminated against following the Leave vote.Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested EU migrants who come to the UK as Brexit nears may not be given the right to stay. He has said there might have to be a cut-off point if there was a ""surge"" in new arrivals.People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote.The day-to-day spending impact is likely to be more significant. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it to remain at least 10% below where it was on 23 June, in the long term. This means imported goods will consequently get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have already been seen and the issue was most notably illustrated by the dispute between Tesco and Marmite's makers about whether prices would be put up or not in the stores.The latest UK inflation figures, for December, showed the CPI inflation rate jumping to 1.6%, its highest level for two years with signs of more cost pressures set to feed through in the months to come.Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration.She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations. As mentioned above, the key issue is whether other EU nations will grant the UK access to the single market, if that is what it wants, while at the same time being allowed to restrict the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK.Mrs May has said she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. It is currently running at 330,000 a year, of which 184,000 are EU citizens, and 188,000 are from outside the EU - the figures include a 39,000 outflow of UK citizens.It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Liberal Democrats - who have just a handful of MPs - have vowed to halt Brexit and keep Britain in the EU if they were to win the next general election.Some commentators, including former House of Commons clerk Lord Lisvane, have argued that a further referendum would be needed to ratify whatever deal the UK hammers out with the EU, but there are few signs political leaders view this as a viable option.Yes. Theresa May has appeared keen to avoid a vote on her negotiating stance, to avoid having to give away her priorities, but Theresa May has said there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. It is worth mentioning that any deal also has to be agreed by the European Parliament - with British MEPs getting a chance to vote on it there.  While there could be limitations on British nationals' ability to live and work in EU countries, it seems unlikely they would want to deter tourists. There are many countries outside the European Economic Area, which includes the 28 EU nations plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway, that British citizens can visit for up to 90 days without needing a visa and it is possible that such arrangements could be negotiated with European countries.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. In theory, the government could, if it wanted, decide to change the colour, which is currently standardised for EU countries, says the BBC's Europe correspondent, Chris Morris.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketNo nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it is ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faces being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. A second independence referendum for the country is now ""highly likely"", she has said, although not in 2017. She has said she wants Scotland to stay in the single market and said Mrs May's decision to rule out the UK staying in the single market ""undoubtedly"" brings the referendum closer.Before his resignation Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said the impact in Northern Ireland would be ""very profound"" and that the whole island of Ireland should now be able to vote on reunification. But, speaking while she was still Northern Ireland Secretary, Theresa Villiers ruled out the call from Sinn Féin for a border poll, saying the circumstances in which one would be called did not exist. The land border is likely to be a key part of the Brexit talks. Theresa May said a priority for her would be negotiating a deal with the EU which allowed a common travel area between the UK and the Republic of Ireland.During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest. But his successor Theresa May has said she will keep it in place, at least for the current Parliament, which is due to last until 2020.So far there has been a cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. There are yet to be signs that rising inflation have worried the Bank of England  enough to consider raising interest rates.  But if that happened it would make mortgages and loans more expensive to repay - but would be good news for savers.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.Eurotunnel boss Jacques Gounon said last November the reintroduction of duty-free would be ""an incredible boost for my business"" but he later said  that remark had been ""light-hearted"". Erik Juul-Mortensen, president of the Tax Free World Association (TFWA) said after the referendum vote ""it is not possible to predict how Brexit will affect the duty free and travel retail industry, and it is wiser not to make assumptions about exactly what the impact will be.""  They are at the moment but no-one knows the longer term prospects for definite. The EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - is not an EU initiative. It was negotiated between countries within a group known as the European Economic Area, often simply referred to as the single market (plus Switzerland, which confusingly is not a member of the EEA, but has agreed access to the single market). Therefore, the future of Britons' EHIC cover could depend on whether the UK decided to sever ties with the EEA.Probably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report. In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two-thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.However, the UK government is committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, the UK government is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR. However, the EU has its own European Court of Justice, whose decisions are binding on EU institutions and member states.Its rulings have sometimes caused controversy in Britain and supporters of a Brexit have called for immediate legislation to curb its powers. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also cited sovereignty and democracy, and they wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Four of the biggest US banks have committed to helping maintain the City's position. But HSBC will move up to 1,000 jobs to Paris, the BBC understands. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Pest control firm Rentokil Initial says it could make £15m extra this year thanks to a weaker currency.Others are less optimistic. Hilary Jones, a director at UK cosmetics firm Lush said the company was ""terrified"" about the economic impact. She added that while the firm's Dorset factory would continue to produce goods for the UK market, products for the European market may be made at its new plant in Germany.Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After the Leave vote, the government will probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""As with most elements of the UK economy, not enough solid data has been published yet to accurately conclude the Brexit effect on house prices. Industry figures have pointed to ""uncertainty"" among buyers and sellers that could potentially change the housing market.So far, the most significant research has come from the respected Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which has published the conclusions of a survey of its members. This primarily records sentiment among surveyors.It found that house prices are expected to fall across the UK in the three months after the referendum vote. However, the dip in prices is only expected to persist over the 12 months from June in London and East Anglia, surveyors predict.House prices were already slowing in central London, owing to the fall-out from changes to stamp duty rules in April.Separate figures from property portal Rightmove suggested the average asking price of houses coming on to the market in England and Wales fell by 0.9%, or £2,647, in July compared with June. It said that agents had reported very few sales had fallen through as a result of the vote.Many potential first-time buyers would welcome a fall in house prices, with ownership among the young falling owing to affordability concerns. Investors in property, or those who have paid off a mortgage and hope to leave homes as inheritance would be unhappy with a long-term reduction in value.  Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law following the decision to leave the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" will not necessarily disappear overnight - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU means the UK will not be part of TTIP. It will have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Former Labour health secretary Lord Owen has said that because of TTIP (see answer above) the only way to protect the NHS from further privatisation was to get out of the EU."

After decades of debate, years of acrimony over the issue in the Conservative Party, months of brutal brinksmanship in Westminster, and hours of debate this week, MPs have just approved the very first step in the process of Britain leaving the European Union. There are many hurdles ahead, probably thousands of hours of debate here, years of negotiations for Theresa May with our friends and rivals around the EU, as she seeks a deal - and possibly as long as a decade of administrative adjustments, as the country extricates itself from the EU. On a wet Wednesday, the debate didn't feel epoch-making, but think for a moment about what has just happened. MPs, most of whom wanted to stay in the EU, have just agreed that we are off.  This time last year few in Westminster really thought that this would happen. The then prime minister's concern was persuading the rest of the EU to give him a better deal for the UK. His close colleagues believed the chances of them losing, let alone the government dissolving over the referendum, were slim, if not quite zero.Then tonight, his former colleagues are rubber stamping the decision of a narrow majority of the public, that changed everything in politics here for good. This isn't even the  last vote on this bill. There are several more stages, the Lords are likely to kick up rough at the start. But after tonight, for better or worse, few will believe that our journey to the exit door can be halted.As government ministers have said in recent days, the moment for turning back is past. "
2017-02-04,Brexit debate notes,https://web.archive.org//web/20170205051606/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-parliaments-38833310,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkI've got five take-outs from the Article 50 bill so far.There may be 101 pages of amendments down so far, but the government is in no mood to take any of them on board; on the contrary, their aim is to repel boarders, to the point where they would even resist the one amendment being mooted by the Brexiteer camp, which would aim to forbid ministers from accepting any extra time to extend the two year negotiating window specified by the EU's Lisbon Treaty. Ministers do believe that the EU's Michel Barnier's strategy is to enmesh the UK in a long-term negotiating limbo, perhaps including a post-Brexit transitional deal, but they don't want their hands tied.Many of the amendments, thus far, look like the product of an amendment generating bot, standard stuff about laying reports and regular debates. But ministers are wary of some of the substantive ones setting conditions - and in particular of the emotive issue of EU nationals resident in Britain, a matter now featuring regularly in most MPs' constituency surgeries. There is strong pressure for some kind of unilateral move for the UK to guarantee their right to remain - but, the government retorts, if that was passed, its backers would be to blame if one or two European states didn't reciprocate and allow UK nationals to stay within their borders.In the debate, Labour's frontbench Brexit spokesman, Sir Keir Starmer, looked and sounded like a lawyer delivering a plea in mitigation on behalf of a convicted prisoner. Early in his speech, he appealed to the Commons for a courteous hearing - something his opposite number, David Davis, would never have got away with. It just about worked, because the House genuinely wanted to hear what he had to say, but he does suffer from the lawyer-turned politician's tendency to address MPs as if they were the Court of Appeal. But leaving aside the style points, forging a line on Brexit which can stitch together the strongly pro-Brexit and strongly pro-Remain elements of Labour's heartland, let alone unify the deeply divided Parliamentary Labour Party, may prove an impossible challenge.Whether it's in the leadership ratings in Conservative Home, where he has now edged ahead of the prime minister herself, or in the growls of approval from his colleagues in the regular statements in the chamber, the Brexit Secretary, David Davis, increasingly commands the status of second minister in this government. This is not a wholly comfortable place to be - flying perilously near to the Sun - but as someone reconciled, not that long ago, to seeing out their parliamentary career on the backbenches, I suspect Mr Davis can bear it. The Lib Dems have sought to position themselves as the last champions of the Remain cause (although two of their MPs, Norman Lamb and Greg Mulholland have promised to abstain on the Article 50 Bill). But they can't claim to be the arch-opponents of Brexit and fail to maintain a presence for the big debates on it - and their leader, Tim Farron, had a chastening time at PMQs when this was pointed out. In truth, their much-reduced parliamentary party has been pretty bad at showing the flag, since the last election. It's rare to see all nine Lib Dem MPs on the green benches. This is one area where they are not very good at remaining. "

The House of Commons says: ""All petitions are checked for fraudulent activity, using both automated and manual checks. The checks prevent fraudulent signatures being added to petitions by individuals trying to repeatedly sign, or automated attacks (bots).""It adds that there is a balance to be made between making it easy for people to sign while making it harder to do so repeatedly.The procedures have been tightened up since last June, when at least 77,000 fraudulent signatures were removed from a petition calling for a second EU referendum.An investigation was launched after posts were found on websites from people claiming to have written programs that would automatically sign the petition thousands of times.The House of Commons will not give details of either the original or new security procedures it has put in place.It is not immediately obvious how the system works to prevent people voting more than once, but fraudulent signatures have been disqualified in the past. It should be said that both petitions have received considerably more than the 100,000 signatures, above which petitions ""almost always"" trigger a debate in Parliament.Read more from Reality Check"
2017-02-04,State visit politics,https://web.archive.org//web/20170205051606/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-38808647,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkA state visit is the ultimate weapon of British diplomacy, the bunker buster of soft power that can break down the hardest of tyrannical hearts. Few world leaders can resist the siren lure of all that royal bling: horse-drawn coaches, state banquets, processions down the Mall, the sheer scale of all that gold leaf and pomp and flummery that allows them a brief window into a royal fantasy that many countries envy but can rarely match. This weapon is deployed sparingly, normally no more than twice a year. But it does get used. If Donald Trump does touch down for a little red carpet treatment later this year, it will be the 110th time the Queen has welcomed another head of state to these shores in her reign. And for now, despite the protests and growing online petition, Downing Street is continuing to stand firm, insisting that the invitation to the president stands.So state visits are not merely ceremonial affairs, they are political and purposeful. They are used by the British government of the day to further what they see as Britain's national interests. In 1973, the Queen welcomed President Mobutu of what was then called Zaire in Africa, now the Democratic Republic of Congo. He was a brutal, corrupt dictator but he was also seen as a vital anti-communist ally in the Cold War against the Soviet Union. So he got an invite to the Palace. President Suharto of Indonesia, another repressive leader who happened to be anti-communist, was also granted a state visit in 1979 for the same reasons.In 1971, Emperor Hirohito of Japan was welcomed by the Queen for a state visit as a deliberate attempt to help usher the country back into the family of nations after its post-war isolation. Not surprisingly, the invitation of the man who had led Japan during World War Two was hugely controversial, and many former army veterans and prisoners of war turned their backs on the royal procession in silent protest. Some wore red gloves to symbolise the blood they saw as being on his hands while others whistled ribald old army tunes. A tree the Emperor had planted was uprooted.In 1978, Nicolae Ceausescu, the notorious Romanian communist leader, and his wife Elena were given a state visit in the vain hope that they might be encouraged to introduce some pro-Western reforms. The Queen was so repulsed by them that, according to the royal author Robert Hardman, while out walking her dogs, she hid behind a bush in the Palace gardens to avoid bumping into the couple who were also out strolling. More than a decade later both Ceausescu and his wife were executed by a revolutionary firing squad.And even the most uncontroversial of state visits, that of President Mandela in 1996, was not without political purpose. There was a feeling in the Foreign Office that South Africa was beginning to slip away from the West towards the unaligned nations, and they wanted to hug Madiba close and remind his country of Britain's anti-apartheid credentials.More recently, in 2014, the state visit of the Irish president to Britain was used as another step of reconciliation. Martin McGuiness, the former Northern Ireland deputy first minister and former IRA leader, not only put on white tie and tails for a state banquet at Windsor Castle, but he also stood for a toast to the Queen. And the state visit of President Xi in 2015 was a deliberate attempt by George Osborne, the then Chancellor, to curry favour with the Chinese and boost British trade links.As for American presidents, only two have been granted full state visits during the current Queen's reign: President Bush in 2003 and President Obama in 2011.What is unusual is the speed with which Mr Trump has been issued with an invitation for a state visit, just days into his presidency. Both Messrs Bush and Obama had to wait until well into their terms of office before they got the call. The haste reflects the importance the prime minister places on securing a good relationship with the new president and winning a post-Brexit trade deal, even if there is some political cost. Mr Bush's visit was by no means uncontroversial, coming so soon after the beginning of the Iraq war. There were demonstrations throughout the trip, including one involving tens of thousands in central London when an effigy of the president was toppled over in a parody of events in Baghdad. So the Queen may be above politics but state visits are not. They are used for diplomacy and are often controversial. And whatever protests may surround any Trump state visit, the Queen will have seen it all before. Rarely has she shown herself unable to cope with whomsoever the government brings round for tea. As one royal insider told me dryly: ""She does have some experience in these matters.""Or as former foreign secretary William Hague wrote more bluntly in the Telegraph this morning, ""A Queen who has been asked over the decades to host tyrants such as Presidents Mobutu of Zaire and Ceausescu of Romania is going to take a brash billionaire from New York effortlessly in her stride.""

2017-02-04,By-election battle,https://web.archive.org//web/20170205051606/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38808154,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkCould voters who chose to leave the EU at the referendum propel UKIP to victory in Stoke-on-Trent Central?A whopping 69% of the electorate across Stoke chose Leave at the EU referendum. A paltry 50% bothered to vote in the constituency at the general election.If UKIP can get out the leavers they can win, or so goes the theory. As it happens both the Labour and Conservative candidates voted Remain at the referendum.Labour's man Gareth Snell even published a rude poem on Twitter about Brexit's flaws. To add to the fun, he has been just as rude about Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell on Twitter.When I ask him if Labour's leader would make a good prime minister he gives an unusually nuanced answer for a candidate: ""Jeremy is the leader of our party. I will campaign for whoever the leader of our party is to be prime minister. ""If that's Jeremy I'll do all I can to make sure he steps through the door of 10 Downing Street.""A UKIP victory here would make good the long-held theory of party leader and candidate Paul Nuttall that his party can defeat Labour in parliamentary elections.Winning a seat at Westminster for himself would also see him triumph where his predecessor Nigel Farage failed. No wonder there's a glint in his eye.The idea of a UKIP win fits the key themes of the moment: Labour struggling, opposition to mainstream parties thriving. But that's why we should be cautious.Let's start with a confession: by-election speculation is grounded on even fewer facts than chatter about national politics. Rather than having those national polls about which we're so sceptical, we have no worthwhile polling at all.Candidates reporting the universally warm reception they have received on the doorstep are taking part in a grand tradition, but offering no evidence.UKIP's performance in by-elections since 2015 has been underwhelming; their best result in a parliamentary contest was a 3% improvement in their vote in Oldham West.In council by elections since September they've held one seat and made one gain from Labour, lost two to the Conservatives and one to the Lib Dems. It's not much of a surge.While the Conservatives are thought to have a much better chance in the by-election in Copeland, they ran UKIP close in Stoke in 2015.Their candidate Jack Brereton sticks with unerring consistency to a handful of talking points, brooking little deviation and plenty of repetition.Why did he vote to remain at the referendum? ""I voted Remain and I've been open and honest about that because - um - but we need to get beyond that, it's about now delivering Brexit,"" he answers.If it's a maddening (for an interviewer) habit to acquire aged 25 it's also the habit of someone who has already become a Tory council cabinet member in a Labour area.Labour's Snell meanwhile is a borough councillor, and argues that while local voters are concerned about Brexit they want to know what plan the prime minister has for jobs and investment in Stoke. On this topic he sounds more sure-footed.UKIP's Nuttall is frank about his tactics. He says: ""If we turn this into a referendum on Brexit we win this seat. It really is as simple as that. The Liberal Democrats did it in Richmond which is a big Remain seat. If we do the same we're in with a really good chance.""Those Liberal Democrats are making their play for the 30% of the vote that rejected Brexit and could woo Labour voters unconvinced by Corbyn, although their candidate Dr Zulfiqar Ali saw his vote plunge 17.5% at the last general election.Bizarrely, in the right places UKIP and the Lib Dems share a strategy - trying to fight out the referendum again on opposing sides and playing to the passions of the politics it left in its wake. UKIP have money - privately they expect to hit the spending limit - and seem to be better organised in Stoke than in other recent contests. The idea that they can use this moment to prise Labour's traditional support away certainly rattles many in Corbyn's party.Shadow cabinet members talk grimly about the idea many voters now identify more with people who vote as they did at the referendum than with those who voted like them at the general election.A compelling fight in Stoke-on-Trent then, but one in its earliest stages. Anyone forecasting the outcome with certainty is placing great store by precedent, doorstep sentiment or hunch.The nomination deadline is 16:00 BST on 31 January.Here is a list of the candidates declared so far:"
2017-02-04,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20170205051606/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38797243,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe claim: The six strongest pro-Leave constituencies and the six strongest pro-Remain constituencies all have Labour MPs.Reality Check verdict: The best estimates available suggest that two of the six most pro-Remain constituencies have SNP MPs, while three of the six most pro-Leave constituencies have Conservative MPs.Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said on Friday that any leader would be challenged by the situation in which the six most passionate pro-Leave and pro-Remain constituencies all had MPs from their party.The EU referendum vote nationwide was close, with 48.1% voting Remain and 51.9% Leave.But Remain voters tended to be clustered in big cities and in Scotland and Northern Ireland, while the Leave vote was more evenly spread.This means that while a small majority of the country voted Leave, a large majority of the country's 650 parliamentary constituencies did so.The votes in June were counted by council, of which there are far fewer - about 400. This is because cities tend to have one council but several Westminster constituencies.This means in most cases we cannot say exactly how each parliamentary constituency voted.  However, Chris Hanretty, an academic at the University of East Anglia, has used the results for local authorities to make detailed estimates for each constituency.These are based on other things we know about the area, such as age, education, ethnicity and income, and how strongly those factors correlate with a vote for Brexit in the places where we know the vote at constituency level for sure.Mr Hanretty estimates that most constituencies where Remain support was the highest did indeed vote Labour in 2015, although Glasgow North and Edinburgh North, both represented by the SNP, are exceptions.But that's not the picture in the areas that most passionately backed Leave.The Brexit vote was strongest in parts of eastern England, especially Lincolnshire, which backed the Conservatives in 2015.Mr Hanretty estimates that Conservative-held Boston and Skegness was the constituency with the highest Leave vote.It covers the Boston council area, which recorded the strongest vote to leave the EU of any local authority, and part of East Lindsey, another overwhelmingly pro-Brexit area.It's true that some places where Leave support was strongest voted Labour in 2015, such as Doncaster North, Ed Miliband's constituency. But the Leave vote was highest in Conservative parts of eastern England.Read more from Reality Check"

The veteran Gaullist already has form.When he was Commissioner for the Internal Market and Financial Services, Mr Barnier was dubbed ""the most dangerous man in Europe"" after taking on the banking sector and championing a cap on bankers' bonuses. But while he alarmed some in the City, and will probably do so again, he also won grudging respect as a tough but even-handed negotiator.He will need all those skills and more in his new role - chief Brexit negotiator at the European Commission. And having moved seamlessly between big jobs in Paris and Brussels - French foreign minister, Commissioner, MEP - he looks well prepared. ""Don't ask me to tell you what will be at the end of the road, we haven't begun to walk yet,"" he told a conference in Brussels last month. Mr Barnier will stick closely to the official EU position of ""no negotiation without notification"" - waiting for the UK to trigger Article 50 to start the formal process of withdrawal. But he's clearly eager to get going.""I am waiting to begin,"" he said. ""I will be ready tomorrow to negotiate, frankly speaking.""And he will bring with him an instinctive pro-European agenda, and a deep knowledge of the workings of the single market.His deputy as chief Brexit negotiator is a German trade expert, Sabine Weyand, adding to the impression that Mr Barnier will lead a team that means business.One of the biggest challenges he (and his boss Jean-Claude Juncker) faces, is to ensure that representatives of the big member states don't sideline him in the Brexit divorce negotiations.But Mr Barnier's long career in French politics means he could well have the ear of the Elysee Palace, especially if - as looks likely - a centre-right candidate wins the French presidency next year. The stakes are so high that there are bound to be some clashes.Mr Barnier has sparred with the UK's Minister for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, before, when the men both served as Europe ministers in the 1990s. It is another reminder that Michel Barnier is a politician first and foremost, rather than a bureaucrat. There have certainly been criticisms - a dash of vanity, a lack of attention to detail. His career has had plenty of downs as well as ups.But he will defend his European vision to the end, and the British government would do well not to underestimate him.At the height of the eurozone crisis, Mr Barnier always refused (politely) to do broadcast interviews in English.""One wrong word,"" he told me once with a smile, ""and we could move markets.""The next few years will be equally challenging."

But people who had supported ""Better Together"" during the Scottish referendum vote also spoke about the possibility of a break-away from the UK as a result of the vote over EU membership.  Perhaps the most significant was Scottish author JK Rowling who tweeted: ""Scotland will seek independence now. Cameron's legacy will be breaking up two unions. Neither needed to happen.""Many took to Twitter to express new or strengthened pro-independence feelings in the wake of the latest vote (Just as a reminder: a ""Yes"" vote in Scotland's 2014 referendum was for independence, while the winning ""No"" campaign backed staying in the UK).One old tweet from 2014's independence referendum gained new life on Friday.

""And if the department can't do that, perhaps somebody else should be looking at it to enforce the promises that the train companies make when they take over running the service,"" she said. The MPs suggested that a complete restructuring of the system would be ""prohibitively impractical"", but it recommended that as contracts expired the DfT might consider whether they be modified to ""align better with the specific market they serve"".Labour, which wants to bring the railways back under public ownership, said the network was ""fragmented and inefficient"".Shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald said: ""A railway works best as an integrated network but privatisation and franchising have meant breaking it up.""Speaking on BBC's The Andrew Marr Show, Mr Grayling said the government was already taking steps to ensure Network Rail worked more closely with rail operators, as recommended by the committee.The DfT said £40bn was being invested to upgrade the railways and that the franchising system had helped to create one of the safest and fastest growing networks in Europe.A spokesman said: ""We can make improvements and the transport secretary has been clear that it will take new ways of working, more investment and better collaboration across the industry to tackle the challenges ahead."""

""But I dread it because I think it would be a divisive and seriously unpleasant event which would set Scot against Scot and I don't think people want to see that.""Mr Mundell said: ""What people want to see is the two governments working together to get the best deal for Scotland and the rest of the UK as we leave the European Union.""The Scottish secretary also said it was not impossible for Scotland to remain part of the European Single Market via the European Free Trade Agreement while remaining in the UK, which is the first minister's wish.Mr Mundell said he did not see the need for a ""differentiated"" agreement for Scotland but his mind was ""open"".The Scottish government's minister for UK Negotiations on Scotland's Place in Europe, Michael Russell, said: ""David Mundell's forced admission that it is possible for Scotland to remain in the United Kingdom and the European single market is a significant concession from the Tories.""The people of Scotland did not vote for Brexit and David Mundell is alone as the only one of the nation's 59 MPs who backed the UK government by voting to trigger Article 50 - despite the grave consequences.""Members of the Scottish Parliament will have a vote on the UK Government's Bill to fire the starting gun on Article 50 this Tuesday. It is essential that the Scottish Parliament's views are heard prior to the end of the Committee Stage of the Article 50 Bill in the House of Commons.""Mr Russell added: ""The Scottish government remains intent on pursuing all possible options to maintain Scotland's place in the European single market and - given that a material constitutional change has occurred since 2014 - the option of independence must remain on the table.""David Mundell twisted and turned when repeatedly asked if he would block an independence referendum but the Tory leadership must realise that it is the people of Scotland, not them, who have the right to choose.""Without that option, Scotland would have to accept whatever decisions the UK government makes - no matter how reckless and damaging they are to Scotland's interests."""
2017-02-05,Labour promises cap on energy price rises,https://web.archive.org//web/20170205143219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38858225,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkLabour has promised to place a cap on the prices charged by energy companies if it wins power.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell made the commitment to the BBC a day after Npower said it was raising electricity prices by 15% from March.Meanwhile, Mr McDonnell used a speech earlier to vow to ""close the gap"" between spending in the north and south of England.But the Conservatives said Labour's plans would ""crash the economy"".  Npower said on Friday that its price rises would take effect on 16 March, with gas increasing by 4.8%. The company said the changes would only affect about half of its customers, but energy regulator Ofgem said it must ""justify"" why it was introducing one of the largest price rises in years. Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Mr McDonnell said people would be paying for the increase having had their wages ""frozen"" since the recession.Asked what Labour would do, he said it would introduce legislation that would limit the amount prices could increase by. ""This is huge. We can't allow this to keep going on,"" he said. Speaking later at Labour's economic conference in Liverpool, Mr McDonnell said the North had consistently lost out in terms of spending - and promised a future Labour government would try to rectify that. He cited figures from the National Infrastructure Commission suggesting projected capital spending per head of population in the north of England would increase by just £1,491 by 2020-2021, compared with by £3,114 per head in London. ""We have to put an end to the Whitehall view that what's good for the City of London is good for the country as a whole,"" he said.""It is time for the rest of the country to get a look-in.""Pledging to create a ""Crossrail for the North"", Mr McDonnell said the high-speed line would reduce journey times between Manchester, Liverpool and Leeds and create 850,000 additional jobs by 2050. The proposed HS3 line was approved in the government's March 2016 Budget but Labour says the government has still not brought forward a definite plan for the scheme. Mr McDonnell also said a Labour government would pass laws requiring ministers to audit capital spending in the English regions against their relative economic need and to report any disparities to Parliament.The government has earmarked £13bn on transport in the North and £19bn in total capital spending for the region. It has created Transport for the North - a new body to co-ordinate transport investment in the region, modelled on Transport for London - and has accepted all its recommendations to improve connectivity.Its plans include an accelerated upgrade of the M62, major improvements to junctions on the M1 and M56, investments in leading stations and £1.2bn to increase capacity on the Northern and TransPennine rail routes.A Conservative spokesman said Labour's borrowing plans ""would crash our economy and threaten jobs and infrastructure""."
2017-02-05,Merkel hails May's hopes for a strong EU,https://web.archive.org//web/20170205143219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38849868,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkGerman chancellor Angela Merkel has welcomed Theresa May's remarks that Britain wants to see a strong Europe - even as it prepares to quit the EU.The prime minister told EU leaders she wanted to build a ""strong partnership"" with the EU and pledged the UK would be a ""good friend and ally"" post-Brexit.But Mrs May was forced to defend her decision to seek a close relationship with US President Donald Trump.EU leaders have voiced concern over his perceived hostility towards the union.Mrs May used a summit of EU Nato leaders in the Maltese capital of Valletta to build alliances ahead of Brexit and to brief her counterparts about her recent visit to the White House to meet Mr Trump.She pledged a further £30m to help with the EU migrant crisis, with the UK providing medical care, temporary shelter and legal support to 60,000 refugees in Greece, Egypt and across the Balkans, while helping to reunite up to 22,000 people with their families.As well as assisting those who want to return home, the UK is offering to work with countries in Asia and Latin America that are willing to welcome refugees but do not have adequate infrastructure in place at present. While Mrs May did not have a formal bilateral meeting with Mrs Merkel, the two leaders did have a ""lengthy discussion"" during a walk through Valletta ahead of a working lunch.The German chancellor told reporters afterwards: ""I am pleased that Theresa May says that she wants a strong Europe.""It's up to us, as the 27, to determine how strong and how good and how rigorous Europe is and how we solve our problems - and Germany wants to do its part on that.""During talks with Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy and Austria's Christian Kern, Mrs May promised that the UK would remain a ""reliable partner"" after Brexit.Mr Rajoy said Mrs May's speech setting out the UK's Brexit plans, including quitting the single market, had ""clarified many things"" and given a greater degree of certainty.""They agreed that it was important to think about the future relationship as well as the detailed exit arrangement, so that we can give greater certainty for people and businesses who want to live and work in each other's countries,"" a Downing Street source said.They also agreed an early deal on the rights of EU citizens in the UK and Britons in the rest of Europe was desirable.Mrs May's visit comes two days after MPs voted to allow her to get Brexit negotiations under way.Malta's prime minister Joseph Muscat said while he wants a ""fair deal"" for the UK after Brexit, it must be ""inferior"" to full EU membership.Mrs May also used the summit to add her weight to President Trump's call for European Nato members to meet the target of spending a minimun of 2% of GDP on defence - a mark the UK is one of the few alliance members to meet.Nato estimates for 2016 show the US, Greece, Poland and Estonia are the only other countries who will fulfil the requirements.The BBC's deputy political editor John Pienaar says it was a tough ask for many European countries, because it would mean doubling their defence expenditure.And European leaders have expressed concern about Mr Trump's comments about the EU and the US ban on refugees and visa holders from a number of mainly Muslim countries. They are also anxious about the man tipped to be Mr Trump's EU ambassador, Ted Malloch, who has suggested the union needed to be ""tamed"".As part of efforts to build a bridge between Washington and Europe, Mrs May said the president's commitment to her about being ""100% behind Nato"" underlines the importance of defence and security co-operation. But Mr Muscat, whose country holds the rotating European Council presidency, said while there were concerns about some of the decisions that are being taken by the new US administration ""there was no sense of anti-Americanism"" among the 28 EU members.""There was a sense that we need to engage with the United States just the same, but that we need to show that we cannot stay silent where there are principles involved,"" he said.""As in any good relationship, we will speak very clearly where we think that those principles are being trampled on.""European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker said while he did not feel threatened by Mr Trump ""there is room for explanations because of the impression the new administration does not know the EU in detail - but in Europe details matter"".Mr Kern said: ""Today we have pretty mixed feelings, to be honest, because the tangible aspects of Mr Trump's policies are raising some concerns.""It's not a threat, it could be a catalyst for a strong, more united Europe. It is an alarm call to see if we are on the right track."" "
2017-02-05,Judges block fresh Brexit challenge,https://web.archive.org//web/20170205143219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38854095,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkA fresh legal challenge to Brexit has been blocked by the High Court.A group of campaigners who want Britain to stay in the EU single market argued that Parliament must approve the UK's exit from the European Economic Area.But the judges refused to give the green light for the challenge, saying the judicial review was ""premature"".The Supreme Court ruled last month that Parliament must have its say before the government can trigger Article 50 and begin official talks on leaving the EU. Parliament is in the process of considering legislation which would give Theresa May the authority to notify the EU of the UK's intention to leave by the end of March.MPs overwhelmingly backed the bill on second reading on Wednesday. The latest legal challenge was brought by supporters of a so-called ""soft Brexit"" - which would see the UK remain a member of the EU's internal market.They include Peter Wilding, chairman of the pro-Europe pressure group British Influence, and lobbyist Adrian Yalland.The government claimed the case was unarguable since the existing EEA agreement would automatically cease to exist once the UK left the EU. Under the terms of the EEA, which first came into legal force in 1994, the EU's 28 members and three other signatories are bound to accept the free movement of people, services, goods and capital across their borders.Dismissing the case, Lord Justice Lloyd Jones and Mr Justice Lewis said the government had not made a decision ""as to the mechanism by which the EEA agreement would cease to apply within the UK"".As a result, they said it was not clear at this stage what issues, if any, would fall within the jurisdiction of the courts. In a joint statement, Mr Wilding and Mr Yalland suggested the government had ""used procedure"" to thwart them. They said they would not rule out bringing further proceedings to give all those who would be directly affected by Brexit some form of legal certainty about their rights. ""It is intolerable that those who depend upon their EEA rights to trade with the EEA, or those who are married to EEA citizens, or are EEA citizens resident in the UK, are being used as a negotiating pawn by a government who can choose to act unilaterally to clarify our legal position, but will not,"" they said.""The government must stop playing poker with our rights and stop taking liberties with our freedoms.""But a government spokesman welcomed Friday's decision.""As the prime minister has said, we will not be a member of the single market and we will be seeking a broad new partnership with the EU including a bold and ambitious free trade agreement,"" he said.Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage said the ruling was ""good news"".

2017-02-05,Northern schools 'need urgent attention',https://web.archive.org//web/20170205143219/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-38854271,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this link""Urgent attention"" must be given to improving education in the North of England, says George Osborne's Northern Powerhouse Partnership think tank. In its first report since being set up last year, the think tank identifies what needs to be done to ""build a Northern Powerhouse"". ""Many issues have been raised with us,"" said the authors, ""but one challenge stood out: education.""Labour said George Osborne's policies as chancellor had harmed the North. Mr Osborne said the region was ""at a turning point"". He set up the think tank last September to champion the ideas he had pursued as chancellor. Launching the report, Mr Osborne said: ""We can either make use of the momentum behind the Northern Powerhouse to really close the North-South gap, or we can let the moment pass and leave our country divided and the North left behind,"" he added. The report recommends urgent attention be given to improving the performance and aspiration of the North's schools and the quality of adult skills, along with better transport and broadband provision and more ambitious local decision making. The aim is to transform the economy of the North of England, said Mr Osborne. The initiative has already ""shifted the North into a new gear"", he said.""We can either make use of the momentum behind the Northern Powerhouse to really close the North-South gap - or we can let the moment pass and leave our country divided and the North left behind. ""Get it right and the northern economy will be £100bn bigger, with more jobs and higher living standards for all.""Ofsted's annual report , published in December, also identified poorly performing schools in the North and East Midlands as fuelling the sense of a divided nation. The outgoing chief inspector of schools, Sir Michael Wilshaw warned then that the economic future of the North relied on addressing poor performance in some schools. Mr Osborne said there was ""overwhelming evidence that attainment at 16 is too low in the North, leaving us lagging behind the UK and international competitors"".The region loses 30,000 graduates a year, according to the report, as students from northern universities move away after graduating. Mr Osborne said he would ask a group of leading employers and education leaders to work with the partnership ""to put this right"". In order to boost education and skills, the report recommends that the North works to: Northern Powerhouse Partnership board member Lord O'Neill agreed that improvements to infrastructure alone were not enough.  ""Something that also shines through in this report is that the education system in the North is not currently performing to its potential; in fact it is currently falling behind the South.""We need an education system that promotes and retains talent and we need to gain graduates, not lose them.""In response the government said it had launched the Northern Powerhouse Schools Strategy review and earmarked £70m to support educational improvement in the North. ""We have also named Scarborough, Oldham, Blackpool, Bradford and Doncaster as Opportunity Areas to benefit from additional funding and resources to promote social mobility,"" said a Department for Education spokesman. But shadow education secretary Angela Rayner said the think-tank report was ""all very well - but let's not forget that he was chancellor in a Tory government that presided over falling school budgets, a chronic teacher shortage and not enough good school places. ""The Tories' huge cuts to schools funding will hit schools in the North hard, making the problems highlighted in this report even worse. ""The Northern Powerhouse means nothing unless the government is prepared to invest in education, skills and infrastructure."" And Anne Longfield, children's commissioner for England, urged the think tank to consider ""why some parts of northern England have the best primary schools in the country, but lower attainment at secondary school and the lowest adult employment rates"". She promised that her own Growing Up North project, would suggest practical ways for the Northern Powerhouse to improve the lives of the region's children and young people. "

The committee said ministers should consider using incentives such as reductions in National Insurance contributions to encourage employers to employ people with disabilities.Committee chairman Frank Field said: ""We expect the government to respond to this report before the proposed new lower rate of ESA is due in April.""If they intend to proceed with these cuts, we expect an explanation of how this will not be detrimental to its target of halving the disability employment gap, by making finding and keeping a job even more difficult for disabled people than it already is.""A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said: ""The number of disabled people in work has increased by almost 600,000 in the last three years, but we're determined to go even further.""Our Work and Health Green Paper marks the next stage of our action to confront the attitudes, prejudices and misunderstandings that have become ingrained within the minds of employers and across wider society.""Our welfare reforms are increasing the support and incentives for people to move into work, while keeping an important safety net in place for those who need it.""In addition to ESA, we also offer support through Personal Independence Payments, to help with the extra costs associated with being disabled."""

It is seeking to expand its sphere of influence, destabilise countries and weaken the alliance.""It is undermining national security for many allies and the international rules-based system.""Therefore it is in our interest and Europe's to keep Nato strong and to deter and dissuade Russia from this course.""Sir Michael backed US president Donald Trump's call for all Nato member states to honour the commitment to spend a minimum of 2% of GDP on defence.A Kremlin spokeman said: ""We're very disappointed that minister Fallon is so aggressively disposed, we are sure that such an accusation against our country is unfounded.""We don't see how a minister that has such a senior post can carry out such unfounded accusations that are based on nothing at all.""We hope that in time, Great Britain will in some way take a constructive approach that will lead to a normalisation in relations between our two countries."""

The latest estimated savings figures, released on Friday, which relate to 2015-16, are not official but are based on departmental reports and other supporting evidence.The savings drive has been underpinned by a shrinkage in the size of the government's property estate, with outdated buildings sold off and smaller departments sharing premises with larger ones. The 2012 sale of the famous Admiralty Arch building in central London, which is being turned into a hotel, yielded capital receipts of £66m this year. ""We have made significant steps forward in tackling fraud, selling off redundant government property such as the former Civil Service College in Sunningdale and making better use of modern digital technology to drive savings,"" said Cabinet Office Minister Ben Gummer.Mr Gummer acknowledged that meeting larger, long-term efficiency targets would depend on the ""total transformation"" of how government worked - requiring more public services to be delivered digitally.Tackling waste and fraud in the payment of benefits, tax credits and government grants has been a priority, as has the quicker recovery of debts. Figures released in December showed the amount of benefits not paid to those entitled to them owing to fraud and error rose had risen to a record £1.7bn. "

""And I should say overall that... there's a lot we have yet to see about the detailed plans, including those for fiscal policy, for government spending and taxes and so forth, so we'll have to wait and see.""But so far, at the margin, yes, it's been positive for global sentiment, and for that reason, and to that extent, for us as well."""

It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 52% to 48%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%, as did Wales, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who resigned on the day after losing the referendum. Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she says she will respect the will of the people. She has said ""Brexit means Brexit"" but there is still a lot of debate about what that will mean in practice especially on the two key issues of how British firms do business in the European Union and what curbs are brought in on the rights of European Union nationals to live and work in the UK. She set out more details of her negotiating hopes in her key speech on Brexit.The UK economy appears to have weathered the initial shock of the Brexit vote, although the value of the pound remains near a 30-year low, but opinion is sharply divided over the long-term effects of leaving the EU. Some major firms such as Easyjet and John Lewis have pointed out that the slump in sterling has increased their costs. Britain also lost its top AAA credit rating, meaning the cost of government borrowing will be higher. But share prices have recovered from a dramatic slump in value, with both the FTSE 100 and the broader FTSE 250 index, which includes more British-based businesses, trading higher than before the referendum. The Bank of England cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - a record low and the first cut since 2009 - after the vote and there has not been the economic slump or recession that some had predicted. Here is a regularly updated detailed rundown of how Britain's economy is doingThe European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it has to invoke an agreement called Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May has said she intends to trigger this process by the end of March 2017, meaning the UK will be expected to have left by the summer of 2019, depending on the precise timetable agreed during the negotiations. The government will also enact a Great Repeal Bill which will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. It is expected to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove.After a court battle, the UK's Supreme Court has ruled that Parliament must be consulted before Article 50 is invoked. This is why a two line Brexit bill is currently making its way through Parliament. MPs and Lords have to vote on it.The court verdict was not what the government argued for, but ministers have insisted it will not delay their planned timetable.Most MPs are expected to vote in favour of Article 50 being triggered, although there could be attempts to amend the draft legislation.Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These men - dubbed the Three Brexiteers - will play a central role in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although it will be Mrs May, as prime minister, who will have the final say. The government did not do any emergency planning for Brexit ahead of the referendum and Mrs May has rejected calls to say what her negotiating goals are.Once Article 50 has been triggered, the UK will have two years to negotiate its withdrawal. But no one really knows how the Brexit process will work - Article 50 was only created in late 2009 and it has never been used. Former Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, now Chancellor, wanted Britain to remain in the EU, and he has suggested it could take up to six years for the UK to complete exit negotiations. The terms of Britain's exit will have to be agreed by 27 national parliaments, a process which could take some years, he has argued. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. The UK will continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making.Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Following Theresa May's Brexit recent speech we now know that the UK is not intending to stay in the EU's single market. Although there has been speculation for months about the issue, it would have meant the UK staying under the auspices of the European Court of Justice and having to allow unlimited EU immigration, under freedom of movement rules.Both sides want trade to continue after Brexit with the UK seeking a positive outcome for those who wish to trade goods and services"" - such as those in the City of London and wanting a ""comprehensive free trade deal"" giving the UK ""the greatest possible access"" to the single market. Mrs May says she wants the UK to reach a new customs union deal with the EU. A customs union is where countries agree not to impose tariffs on each others' goods and have a common tariff on goods coming in from elsewhere. The UK is currently part of the EU customs union but that stops the UK being able to do its own trade deals with other countries. Reality Check: How could customs union work?These terms have increasingly been used as debate focused on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people in order to maintain access to the EU single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result.The government has declined to give a firm guarantee about the status of EU nationals currently living in the UK, saying this is not possible without a reciprocal pledge from other EU members about the millions of British nationals living on the continent. EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, will be be able to stay, the chief civil servant at the Home Office has said. The rights of other EU nationals would be subject to negotiations on Brexit and the ""will of Parliament"", he added.A lot depends on the kind of deal the UK agrees with the EU. If it remains within the single market, it would almost certainly retain free movement rights, allowing UK citizens to work in the EU and vice versa. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.Again, it depends on whether the UK government decides to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages. Citizens' Advice has reminded people their rights have not changed yet and asked anyone to contact them if they think they have been discriminated against following the Leave vote.Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested EU migrants who come to the UK as Brexit nears may not be given the right to stay. He has said there might have to be a cut-off point if there was a ""surge"" in new arrivals.People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote.The day-to-day spending impact is likely to be more significant. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it to remain at least 10% below where it was on 23 June, in the long term. This means imported goods will consequently get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have already been seen and the issue was most notably illustrated by the dispute between Tesco and Marmite's makers about whether prices would be put up or not in the stores.The latest UK inflation figures, for December, showed the CPI inflation rate jumping to 1.6%, its highest level for two years with signs of more cost pressures set to feed through in the months to come.Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration.She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations. As mentioned above, the key issue is whether other EU nations will grant the UK access to the single market, if that is what it wants, while at the same time being allowed to restrict the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK.Mrs May has said she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. It is currently running at 330,000 a year, of which 184,000 are EU citizens, and 188,000 are from outside the EU - the figures include a 39,000 outflow of UK citizens.It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Liberal Democrats - who have just a handful of MPs - have vowed to halt Brexit and keep Britain in the EU if they were to win the next general election.Some commentators, including former House of Commons clerk Lord Lisvane, have argued that a further referendum would be needed to ratify whatever deal the UK hammers out with the EU, but there are few signs political leaders view this as a viable option.Yes. Theresa May has appeared keen to avoid a vote on her negotiating stance, to avoid having to give away her priorities, but Theresa May has said there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. It is worth mentioning that any deal also has to be agreed by the European Parliament - with British MEPs getting a chance to vote on it there.  While there could be limitations on British nationals' ability to live and work in EU countries, it seems unlikely they would want to deter tourists. There are many countries outside the European Economic Area, which includes the 28 EU nations plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway, that British citizens can visit for up to 90 days without needing a visa and it is possible that such arrangements could be negotiated with European countries.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. In theory, the government could, if it wanted, decide to change the colour, which is currently standardised for EU countries, says the BBC's Europe correspondent, Chris Morris.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketNo nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it is ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faces being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. A second independence referendum for the country is now ""highly likely"", she has said, although not in 2017. She has said she wants Scotland to stay in the single market and said Mrs May's decision to rule out the UK staying in the single market ""undoubtedly"" brings the referendum closer.Before his resignation Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said the impact in Northern Ireland would be ""very profound"" and that the whole island of Ireland should now be able to vote on reunification. But, speaking while she was still Northern Ireland Secretary, Theresa Villiers ruled out the call from Sinn Féin for a border poll, saying the circumstances in which one would be called did not exist. The land border is likely to be a key part of the Brexit talks. Theresa May said a priority for her would be negotiating a deal with the EU which allowed a common travel area between the UK and the Republic of Ireland.During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest. But his successor Theresa May has said she will keep it in place, at least for the current Parliament, which is due to last until 2020.So far there has been a cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. There are yet to be signs that rising inflation have worried the Bank of England  enough to consider raising interest rates.  But if that happened it would make mortgages and loans more expensive to repay - but would be good news for savers.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.Eurotunnel boss Jacques Gounon said last November the reintroduction of duty-free would be ""an incredible boost for my business"" but he later said  that remark had been ""light-hearted"". Erik Juul-Mortensen, president of the Tax Free World Association (TFWA) said after the referendum vote ""it is not possible to predict how Brexit will affect the duty free and travel retail industry, and it is wiser not to make assumptions about exactly what the impact will be.""  They are at the moment but no-one knows the longer term prospects for definite. The EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - is not an EU initiative. It was negotiated between countries within a group known as the European Economic Area, often simply referred to as the single market (plus Switzerland, which confusingly is not a member of the EEA, but has agreed access to the single market). Therefore, the future of Britons' EHIC cover could depend on whether the UK decided to sever ties with the EEA.Probably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report. In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two-thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.However, the UK government is committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, the UK government is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR. However, the EU has its own European Court of Justice, whose decisions are binding on EU institutions and member states.Its rulings have sometimes caused controversy in Britain and supporters of a Brexit have called for immediate legislation to curb its powers. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also cited sovereignty and democracy, and they wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Four of the biggest US banks have committed to helping maintain the City's position. But HSBC will move up to 1,000 jobs to Paris, the BBC understands. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Pest control firm Rentokil Initial says it could make £15m extra this year thanks to a weaker currency.Others are less optimistic. Hilary Jones, a director at UK cosmetics firm Lush said the company was ""terrified"" about the economic impact. She added that while the firm's Dorset factory would continue to produce goods for the UK market, products for the European market may be made at its new plant in Germany.Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After the Leave vote, the government will probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""As with most elements of the UK economy, not enough solid data has been published yet to accurately conclude the Brexit effect on house prices. Industry figures have pointed to ""uncertainty"" among buyers and sellers that could potentially change the housing market.So far, the most significant research has come from the respected Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which has published the conclusions of a survey of its members. This primarily records sentiment among surveyors.It found that house prices are expected to fall across the UK in the three months after the referendum vote. However, the dip in prices is only expected to persist over the 12 months from June in London and East Anglia, surveyors predict.House prices were already slowing in central London, owing to the fall-out from changes to stamp duty rules in April.Separate figures from property portal Rightmove suggested the average asking price of houses coming on to the market in England and Wales fell by 0.9%, or £2,647, in July compared with June. It said that agents had reported very few sales had fallen through as a result of the vote.Many potential first-time buyers would welcome a fall in house prices, with ownership among the young falling owing to affordability concerns. Investors in property, or those who have paid off a mortgage and hope to leave homes as inheritance would be unhappy with a long-term reduction in value.  Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law following the decision to leave the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" will not necessarily disappear overnight - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU means the UK will not be part of TTIP. It will have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Former Labour health secretary Lord Owen has said that because of TTIP (see answer above) the only way to protect the NHS from further privatisation was to get out of the EU."

After decades of debate, years of acrimony over the issue in the Conservative Party, months of brutal brinksmanship in Westminster, and hours of debate this week, MPs have just approved the very first step in the process of Britain leaving the European Union. There are many hurdles ahead, probably thousands of hours of debate here, years of negotiations for Theresa May with our friends and rivals around the EU, as she seeks a deal - and possibly as long as a decade of administrative adjustments, as the country extricates itself from the EU. On a wet Wednesday, the debate didn't feel epoch-making, but think for a moment about what has just happened. MPs, most of whom wanted to stay in the EU, have just agreed that we are off.  This time last year few in Westminster really thought that this would happen. The then prime minister's concern was persuading the rest of the EU to give him a better deal for the UK. His close colleagues believed the chances of them losing, let alone the government dissolving over the referendum, were slim, if not quite zero.Then tonight, his former colleagues are rubber stamping the decision of a narrow majority of the public, that changed everything in politics here for good. This isn't even the  last vote on this bill. There are several more stages, the Lords are likely to kick up rough at the start. But after tonight, for better or worse, few will believe that our journey to the exit door can be halted.As government ministers have said in recent days, the moment for turning back is past. "
2017-02-05,Brexit debate notes,https://web.archive.org//web/20170205143219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-parliaments-38833310,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkI've got five take-outs from the Article 50 bill so far.There may be 101 pages of amendments down so far, but the government is in no mood to take any of them on board; on the contrary, their aim is to repel boarders, to the point where they would even resist the one amendment being mooted by the Brexiteer camp, which would aim to forbid ministers from accepting any extra time to extend the two year negotiating window specified by the EU's Lisbon Treaty. Ministers do believe that the EU's Michel Barnier's strategy is to enmesh the UK in a long-term negotiating limbo, perhaps including a post-Brexit transitional deal, but they don't want their hands tied.Many of the amendments, thus far, look like the product of an amendment generating bot, standard stuff about laying reports and regular debates. But ministers are wary of some of the substantive ones setting conditions - and in particular of the emotive issue of EU nationals resident in Britain, a matter now featuring regularly in most MPs' constituency surgeries. There is strong pressure for some kind of unilateral move for the UK to guarantee their right to remain - but, the government retorts, if that was passed, its backers would be to blame if one or two European states didn't reciprocate and allow UK nationals to stay within their borders.In the debate, Labour's frontbench Brexit spokesman, Sir Keir Starmer, looked and sounded like a lawyer delivering a plea in mitigation on behalf of a convicted prisoner. Early in his speech, he appealed to the Commons for a courteous hearing - something his opposite number, David Davis, would never have got away with. It just about worked, because the House genuinely wanted to hear what he had to say, but he does suffer from the lawyer-turned politician's tendency to address MPs as if they were the Court of Appeal. But leaving aside the style points, forging a line on Brexit which can stitch together the strongly pro-Brexit and strongly pro-Remain elements of Labour's heartland, let alone unify the deeply divided Parliamentary Labour Party, may prove an impossible challenge.Whether it's in the leadership ratings in Conservative Home, where he has now edged ahead of the prime minister herself, or in the growls of approval from his colleagues in the regular statements in the chamber, the Brexit Secretary, David Davis, increasingly commands the status of second minister in this government. This is not a wholly comfortable place to be - flying perilously near to the Sun - but as someone reconciled, not that long ago, to seeing out their parliamentary career on the backbenches, I suspect Mr Davis can bear it. The Lib Dems have sought to position themselves as the last champions of the Remain cause (although two of their MPs, Norman Lamb and Greg Mulholland have promised to abstain on the Article 50 Bill). But they can't claim to be the arch-opponents of Brexit and fail to maintain a presence for the big debates on it - and their leader, Tim Farron, had a chastening time at PMQs when this was pointed out. In truth, their much-reduced parliamentary party has been pretty bad at showing the flag, since the last election. It's rare to see all nine Lib Dem MPs on the green benches. This is one area where they are not very good at remaining. "

The House of Commons says: ""All petitions are checked for fraudulent activity, using both automated and manual checks. The checks prevent fraudulent signatures being added to petitions by individuals trying to repeatedly sign, or automated attacks (bots).""It adds that there is a balance to be made between making it easy for people to sign while making it harder to do so repeatedly.The procedures have been tightened up since last June, when at least 77,000 fraudulent signatures were removed from a petition calling for a second EU referendum.An investigation was launched after posts were found on websites from people claiming to have written programs that would automatically sign the petition thousands of times.The House of Commons will not give details of either the original or new security procedures it has put in place.It is not immediately obvious how the system works to prevent people voting more than once, but fraudulent signatures have been disqualified in the past. It should be said that both petitions have received considerably more than the 100,000 signatures, above which petitions ""almost always"" trigger a debate in Parliament.Read more from Reality Check"
2017-02-05,State visit politics,https://web.archive.org//web/20170205143219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-38808647,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkA state visit is the ultimate weapon of British diplomacy, the bunker buster of soft power that can break down the hardest of tyrannical hearts. Few world leaders can resist the siren lure of all that royal bling: horse-drawn coaches, state banquets, processions down the Mall, the sheer scale of all that gold leaf and pomp and flummery that allows them a brief window into a royal fantasy that many countries envy but can rarely match. This weapon is deployed sparingly, normally no more than twice a year. But it does get used. If Donald Trump does touch down for a little red carpet treatment later this year, it will be the 110th time the Queen has welcomed another head of state to these shores in her reign. And for now, despite the protests and growing online petition, Downing Street is continuing to stand firm, insisting that the invitation to the president stands.So state visits are not merely ceremonial affairs, they are political and purposeful. They are used by the British government of the day to further what they see as Britain's national interests. In 1973, the Queen welcomed President Mobutu of what was then called Zaire in Africa, now the Democratic Republic of Congo. He was a brutal, corrupt dictator but he was also seen as a vital anti-communist ally in the Cold War against the Soviet Union. So he got an invite to the Palace. President Suharto of Indonesia, another repressive leader who happened to be anti-communist, was also granted a state visit in 1979 for the same reasons.In 1971, Emperor Hirohito of Japan was welcomed by the Queen for a state visit as a deliberate attempt to help usher the country back into the family of nations after its post-war isolation. Not surprisingly, the invitation of the man who had led Japan during World War Two was hugely controversial, and many former army veterans and prisoners of war turned their backs on the royal procession in silent protest. Some wore red gloves to symbolise the blood they saw as being on his hands while others whistled ribald old army tunes. A tree the Emperor had planted was uprooted.In 1978, Nicolae Ceausescu, the notorious Romanian communist leader, and his wife Elena were given a state visit in the vain hope that they might be encouraged to introduce some pro-Western reforms. The Queen was so repulsed by them that, according to the royal author Robert Hardman, while out walking her dogs, she hid behind a bush in the Palace gardens to avoid bumping into the couple who were also out strolling. More than a decade later both Ceausescu and his wife were executed by a revolutionary firing squad.And even the most uncontroversial of state visits, that of President Mandela in 1996, was not without political purpose. There was a feeling in the Foreign Office that South Africa was beginning to slip away from the West towards the unaligned nations, and they wanted to hug Madiba close and remind his country of Britain's anti-apartheid credentials.More recently, in 2014, the state visit of the Irish president to Britain was used as another step of reconciliation. Martin McGuiness, the former Northern Ireland deputy first minister and former IRA leader, not only put on white tie and tails for a state banquet at Windsor Castle, but he also stood for a toast to the Queen. And the state visit of President Xi in 2015 was a deliberate attempt by George Osborne, the then Chancellor, to curry favour with the Chinese and boost British trade links.As for American presidents, only two have been granted full state visits during the current Queen's reign: President Bush in 2003 and President Obama in 2011.What is unusual is the speed with which Mr Trump has been issued with an invitation for a state visit, just days into his presidency. Both Messrs Bush and Obama had to wait until well into their terms of office before they got the call. The haste reflects the importance the prime minister places on securing a good relationship with the new president and winning a post-Brexit trade deal, even if there is some political cost. Mr Bush's visit was by no means uncontroversial, coming so soon after the beginning of the Iraq war. There were demonstrations throughout the trip, including one involving tens of thousands in central London when an effigy of the president was toppled over in a parody of events in Baghdad. So the Queen may be above politics but state visits are not. They are used for diplomacy and are often controversial. And whatever protests may surround any Trump state visit, the Queen will have seen it all before. Rarely has she shown herself unable to cope with whomsoever the government brings round for tea. As one royal insider told me dryly: ""She does have some experience in these matters.""Or as former foreign secretary William Hague wrote more bluntly in the Telegraph this morning, ""A Queen who has been asked over the decades to host tyrants such as Presidents Mobutu of Zaire and Ceausescu of Romania is going to take a brash billionaire from New York effortlessly in her stride.""

2017-02-05,By-election battle,https://web.archive.org//web/20170205143219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38808154,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkCould voters who chose to leave the EU at the referendum propel UKIP to victory in Stoke-on-Trent Central?A whopping 69% of the electorate across Stoke chose Leave at the EU referendum. A paltry 50% bothered to vote in the constituency at the general election.If UKIP can get out the leavers they can win, or so goes the theory. As it happens both the Labour and Conservative candidates voted Remain at the referendum.Labour's man Gareth Snell even published a rude poem on Twitter about Brexit's flaws. To add to the fun, he has been just as rude about Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell on Twitter.When I ask him if Labour's leader would make a good prime minister he gives an unusually nuanced answer for a candidate: ""Jeremy is the leader of our party. I will campaign for whoever the leader of our party is to be prime minister. ""If that's Jeremy I'll do all I can to make sure he steps through the door of 10 Downing Street.""A UKIP victory here would make good the long-held theory of party leader and candidate Paul Nuttall that his party can defeat Labour in parliamentary elections.Winning a seat at Westminster for himself would also see him triumph where his predecessor Nigel Farage failed. No wonder there's a glint in his eye.The idea of a UKIP win fits the key themes of the moment: Labour struggling, opposition to mainstream parties thriving. But that's why we should be cautious.Let's start with a confession: by-election speculation is grounded on even fewer facts than chatter about national politics. Rather than having those national polls about which we're so sceptical, we have no worthwhile polling at all.Candidates reporting the universally warm reception they have received on the doorstep are taking part in a grand tradition, but offering no evidence.UKIP's performance in by-elections since 2015 has been underwhelming; their best result in a parliamentary contest was a 3% improvement in their vote in Oldham West.In council by elections since September they've held one seat and made one gain from Labour, lost two to the Conservatives and one to the Lib Dems. It's not much of a surge.While the Conservatives are thought to have a much better chance in the by-election in Copeland, they ran UKIP close in Stoke in 2015.Their candidate Jack Brereton sticks with unerring consistency to a handful of talking points, brooking little deviation and plenty of repetition.Why did he vote to remain at the referendum? ""I voted Remain and I've been open and honest about that because - um - but we need to get beyond that, it's about now delivering Brexit,"" he answers.If it's a maddening (for an interviewer) habit to acquire aged 25 it's also the habit of someone who has already become a Tory council cabinet member in a Labour area.Labour's Snell meanwhile is a borough councillor, and argues that while local voters are concerned about Brexit they want to know what plan the prime minister has for jobs and investment in Stoke. On this topic he sounds more sure-footed.UKIP's Nuttall is frank about his tactics. He says: ""If we turn this into a referendum on Brexit we win this seat. It really is as simple as that. The Liberal Democrats did it in Richmond which is a big Remain seat. If we do the same we're in with a really good chance.""Those Liberal Democrats are making their play for the 30% of the vote that rejected Brexit and could woo Labour voters unconvinced by Corbyn, although their candidate Dr Zulfiqar Ali saw his vote plunge 17.5% at the last general election.Bizarrely, in the right places UKIP and the Lib Dems share a strategy - trying to fight out the referendum again on opposing sides and playing to the passions of the politics it left in its wake. UKIP have money - privately they expect to hit the spending limit - and seem to be better organised in Stoke than in other recent contests. The idea that they can use this moment to prise Labour's traditional support away certainly rattles many in Corbyn's party.Shadow cabinet members talk grimly about the idea many voters now identify more with people who vote as they did at the referendum than with those who voted like them at the general election.A compelling fight in Stoke-on-Trent then, but one in its earliest stages. Anyone forecasting the outcome with certainty is placing great store by precedent, doorstep sentiment or hunch.The nomination deadline is 16:00 BST on 31 January.Here is a list of the candidates declared so far:"
2017-02-05,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20170205143219/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38797243,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe claim: The six strongest pro-Leave constituencies and the six strongest pro-Remain constituencies all have Labour MPs.Reality Check verdict: The best estimates available suggest that two of the six most pro-Remain constituencies have SNP MPs, while three of the six most pro-Leave constituencies have Conservative MPs.Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said on Friday that any leader would be challenged by the situation in which the six most passionate pro-Leave and pro-Remain constituencies all had MPs from their party.The EU referendum vote nationwide was close, with 48.1% voting Remain and 51.9% Leave.But Remain voters tended to be clustered in big cities and in Scotland and Northern Ireland, while the Leave vote was more evenly spread.This means that while a small majority of the country voted Leave, a large majority of the country's 650 parliamentary constituencies did so.The votes in June were counted by council, of which there are far fewer - about 400. This is because cities tend to have one council but several Westminster constituencies.This means in most cases we cannot say exactly how each parliamentary constituency voted.  However, Chris Hanretty, an academic at the University of East Anglia, has used the results for local authorities to make detailed estimates for each constituency.These are based on other things we know about the area, such as age, education, ethnicity and income, and how strongly those factors correlate with a vote for Brexit in the places where we know the vote at constituency level for sure.Mr Hanretty estimates that most constituencies where Remain support was the highest did indeed vote Labour in 2015, although Glasgow North and Edinburgh North, both represented by the SNP, are exceptions.But that's not the picture in the areas that most passionately backed Leave.The Brexit vote was strongest in parts of eastern England, especially Lincolnshire, which backed the Conservatives in 2015.Mr Hanretty estimates that Conservative-held Boston and Skegness was the constituency with the highest Leave vote.It covers the Boston council area, which recorded the strongest vote to leave the EU of any local authority, and part of East Lindsey, another overwhelmingly pro-Brexit area.It's true that some places where Leave support was strongest voted Labour in 2015, such as Doncaster North, Ed Miliband's constituency. But the Leave vote was highest in Conservative parts of eastern England.Read more from Reality Check"

The veteran Gaullist already has form.When he was Commissioner for the Internal Market and Financial Services, Mr Barnier was dubbed ""the most dangerous man in Europe"" after taking on the banking sector and championing a cap on bankers' bonuses. But while he alarmed some in the City, and will probably do so again, he also won grudging respect as a tough but even-handed negotiator.He will need all those skills and more in his new role - chief Brexit negotiator at the European Commission. And having moved seamlessly between big jobs in Paris and Brussels - French foreign minister, Commissioner, MEP - he looks well prepared. ""Don't ask me to tell you what will be at the end of the road, we haven't begun to walk yet,"" he told a conference in Brussels last month. Mr Barnier will stick closely to the official EU position of ""no negotiation without notification"" - waiting for the UK to trigger Article 50 to start the formal process of withdrawal. But he's clearly eager to get going.""I am waiting to begin,"" he said. ""I will be ready tomorrow to negotiate, frankly speaking.""And he will bring with him an instinctive pro-European agenda, and a deep knowledge of the workings of the single market.His deputy as chief Brexit negotiator is a German trade expert, Sabine Weyand, adding to the impression that Mr Barnier will lead a team that means business.One of the biggest challenges he (and his boss Jean-Claude Juncker) faces, is to ensure that representatives of the big member states don't sideline him in the Brexit divorce negotiations.But Mr Barnier's long career in French politics means he could well have the ear of the Elysee Palace, especially if - as looks likely - a centre-right candidate wins the French presidency next year. The stakes are so high that there are bound to be some clashes.Mr Barnier has sparred with the UK's Minister for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, before, when the men both served as Europe ministers in the 1990s. It is another reminder that Michel Barnier is a politician first and foremost, rather than a bureaucrat. There have certainly been criticisms - a dash of vanity, a lack of attention to detail. His career has had plenty of downs as well as ups.But he will defend his European vision to the end, and the British government would do well not to underestimate him.At the height of the eurozone crisis, Mr Barnier always refused (politely) to do broadcast interviews in English.""One wrong word,"" he told me once with a smile, ""and we could move markets.""The next few years will be equally challenging."

Perhaps the most significant was Scottish author JK Rowling who tweeted: ""Scotland will seek independence now. Cameron's legacy will be breaking up two unions. Neither needed to happen.""Many took to Twitter to express new or strengthened pro-independence feelings in the wake of the latest vote (Just as a reminder: a ""Yes"" vote in Scotland's 2014 referendum was for independence, while the winning ""No"" campaign backed staying in the UK).One old tweet from 2014's independence referendum gained new life on Friday.

2017-02-06,May: Don't obstruct voters over Brexit,https://web.archive.org//web/20170207024214/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38879249,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkTheresa May has warned MPs not to ""obstruct"" the will of UK voters by changing the parliamentary bill aimed at getting Brexit talks under way.The Commons is beginning detailed scrutiny of the European Union Bill, with Labour, SNP and Lib Dem MPs seeking concessions.These include a guarantee that EU citizens resident in the UK at the time of last year's referendum can remain. But Mrs May said she and EU leaders wanted to ""get on"" with Brexit talks.MPs have already backed the principle of the bill, which would give Mrs May the power to trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, starting formal negotiations on Brexit.Labour has suggested it will not ""frustrate Brexit"" even if it fails to amend the bill in its committee stage this week, during which it will undergo more detailed scrutiny.The government wants to notify the EU of its intention to leave, giving effect to last June's referendum vote and starting two years of talks, by the end of March.For this to happen, MPs and peers must pass a bill giving their approval - a process expected to take about a month. In a statement on the weekend's EU summit in Malta, Mrs May told MPs: ""Our European partners now want to get on with the negotiations. So do I, and so does this House, which last week voted by a majority of 384 in support of the government triggering Article 50.""There are of course further stages for the Bill in committee and in the Lords and it is right that this process should be completed properly.""She added: ""But the message is clear to all - this House has spoken and now is not the time to obstruct the democratically expressed wishes of the British people.""It is time to get on with leaving the European Union and building an independent, self-governing, global Britain.""The legislation comes back to the Commons on Monday for three days of debate culminating in a vote on its third reading.Among the amendments that could be be debated on Monday is one tabled by former Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman calling for a guarantee that all nationals of other EU countries lawfully resident in the UK at the time of last year's referendum should have the right to remain after Brexit.Mrs May has said she wants an early agreement on their status but is resisting calls from many MPs to offer a unilateral guarantee - saying she wants reciprocal guarantees from other EU countries about UK citizens living on the continent.Ms Harman's amendment has the backing of the Lib Dems, SNP and the one Green MP - although it would need the support of a number of Conservatives for it to pass.Labour is also seeking a ""meaningful vote"" in Parliament on the final deal struck between the UK and the EU before it is voted on by the European Parliament. The BBC understands some Conservative MPs have held discussions with Labour MPs about forcing the PM to concede a vote if there is no agreement on the UK's future trade relations with the EU.Downing Street has insisted that it is ""not contemplating"" a scenario in which there is no deal with the EU and the bill does not need to be amended.Ministers have said they believe the UK will be able to agree the terms of its separation and the outline of a trade deal within the two-year timeframe and even if there is no trade agreement, the UK will leave the EU anyway.There continue to be divisions in Labour ranks over whether to accept Brexit or not. Ten shadow ministers were among 47 Labour MPs who rejected party orders to back the bill at second reading last week while shadow home secretary Diane Abbott missed the crucial vote, citing illness.Shadow business secretary Clive Lewis has said he will vote against the bill at third reading on Wednesday unless Labour's amendments are accepted, describing them as ""red lines"".Labour's shadow cabinet will discuss the party's approach on Tuesday but Mr Corbyn suggested on Sunday that Ms Abbott and others would be expected to follow the party line if a three-line whip is imposed for Wednesday's vote. Also speaking on Sunday, shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said there were ""private conversations"" taking place between the parties on trying to find ""a compromise that will work"". She denied it was ""illogical"" to demand amendments but still back the bill in the final vote if they are rejected."
2017-02-06,Voting data sheds light on referendum,https://web.archive.org//web/20170207024214/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38762034,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe BBC has obtained a more localised breakdown of votes from nearly half of the local authorities which counted EU referendum ballots last June.This information provides much greater depth and detail in explaining the pattern of how the UK voted. The key findings are:A statistical analysis of the data obtained for over a thousand individual local government wards confirms how the strength of the local Leave vote was strongly associated with lower educational qualifications.Wards where the population had fewer qualifications tended to have a higher Leave vote, as shown in the chart. If the proportion of the local electorate with a degree or similar qualification was one percentage point lower, then on average the leave vote was higher by nearly one percentage point.Using ward-level data means we can compare voting figures in this way to the local demographic information collected in the 2011 census. Of the main census statistics, this is the one with the greatest association with how people voted. In statistical terms the level of educational qualifications explains about two-thirds of the variation in the results between different wards. The correlation is strong, whether based on assessing graduate and equivalent qualifications or lower-level ones. This ward-by-ward analysis covers 1,070 individual wards in England and Wales whose boundaries had not changed since the 2011 census, about one in nine of the UK's wards. We had very little ward-level data from Scotland, and none from Northern Ireland.It should be noted, however, that many ward counts also included some postal votes from across the counting area, and therefore some variation between wards will have been masked by the random allocation of postal votes for counting. This makes the results less accurate geographically, but we can still use the information to explore broad national and local patterns.  Adding age as a second factor significantly helps to further explain voting patterns. Older populations were more likely to vote Leave. Education and age combined account for nearly 80% of the voting variation between wards. Ethnicity is a smaller factor, but one which also contributed to the results. Adding that in means that now 83% of the variation in the vote between wards is explained. White populations were generally more pro-Leave, and ethnic minorities less so.  However, there were some interesting differences between London and elsewhere.The ethnic dimension is particularly interesting when examining the outliers on the graph that compares the Leave vote to levels of education.There are numerous wards towards the bottom left of the graph where electorates with lower educational qualifications nevertheless produced low Leave and high Remain votes. This is where the link between low qualifications and Leave voting breaks down. It turns out that these exceptional wards have high ethnic minority populations, particularly in Birmingham and Haringey in north London. In contrast, there are virtually no dramatic outliers on the other side of the line, where comparatively highly educated populations voted Leave. Only one point on the graph stands out - this is Osterley and Spring Grove in Hounslow, west London, a mainly ethnic minority ward which had a Leave vote of 63%. While this figure does include some postal votes, they are not nearly enough to explain away this unusual outcome.In fact, in Ealing and Hounslow, west London boroughs with many voters of Asian origin, the ethnic correlation was in the other direction to the national picture: a higher number of Asian voters was associated with a higher Leave vote.This powerful link to educational attainment could stem from the lower qualified tending to feel less confident about their prospects and ability to compete for work in a competitive globalised economy with high levels of migration. On the other hand some commentators see it as primarily reflecting a ""culture war"" or ""values conflict"", rather than issues of economics and inequality. Research shows that non-graduates tend to take less liberal positions than graduates on a range of social issues from immigration and multi-culturalism to the death penalty.   The former campaign director of Vote Leave, Dominic Cummings, argues that the better educated are more prone to holding irrational political opinions because they are more driven by fashion and a group mentality. Of course this assessment does not imply that Leave voters were almost all poorly educated and old, and Remain voters well educated and young. The Leave side obviously attracted support from many middle class professionals, graduates and younger people. Otherwise it couldn't have won. While there was undoubtedly a lot of voting which cut across these criteria, the point of this analysis is to explore how different social groups most probably voted - and it is clear that education, age and ethnicity were crucial influences.  After these three key factors are taken into account, adding in further demographic measures from the census does little to increase the explanation of UK-wide voting patterns. However, this does not reflect the distinctively more pro-Remain voting in Scotland, since we are short of Scottish data at this geographical level. It is clear as well that in a few specific locations high student numbers were also very relevant. To a certain extent, using the level of educational qualifications as a measure combines both class and age factors, with working class and older adults both tending to be less well qualified.But the association between education and the voting results is stronger than the association between social or occupational class and the results. This is still true after taking the age of the local population into account.This suggests that voters with lower qualifications were more likely to back Leave than the better qualified, even when they were in the same social or occupational class.The existence of a significant connection between Leave voting and lower educational qualifications had already been suggested by analysis of the published referendum results from the official counting areas.The data we have obtained strengthens this conclusion, because voting patterns can now be compared to social statistics from the 2011 census at a much more detailed geographical level than by the earlier studies. The BBC analysis is also consistent with opinion polling (for example, from Lord Ashcroft, Ipsos Mori and YouGov) that tried to identify the characteristics of Leave and Remain voters.  The data we have collected can be used to illustrate the sort of places where the Leave and Remain camps did particularly well: it is hard to imagine a more glaring social contrast than that between the deprived, poorly educated housing estates of Brambles and Thorntree in Middlesbrough, and the privileged elite colleges of Market ward in central Cambridge. It is important to bear in mind, however, that most of the voting figures mentioned below also include some postal votes, so they should be treated as approximate rather than precise.  It is also important to note that the examples are limited to the places for which we were able to obtain localised information, which was only a minority of areas. The rest of the country may well contain even starker instances.Of the 1,283 individual wards for which we have data, the highest Leave vote was 82.5% in Brambles and Thorntree, a section of east Middlesbrough with many social problems. Ward boundaries have changed since the 2011 census, but in that survey the Thorntree part of the area had the lowest proportion of people with a degree or similar qualification of anywhere in England and Wales, at only 5%. And according to Middlesbrough council, the figure for the current Brambles and Thorntree ward is even lower, at just 4%. Second highest was 80.3% in Waterlees Village, a poor locality within Wisbech, Cambridgeshire. This area has seen a major influx of East European migrants who have been doing low-paid work in nearby food processing factories and farms, with tensions between them and British residents. Other wards with available data which had the strongest Leave votes were congregated in Middlesbrough, Canvey Island in Essex, Skegness in coastal Lincolnshire, and Havering in east London.The highest Remain vote was 87.8% in Market ward in central Cambridge, an area with numerous colleges and a high student population, in a city which was strongly pro-Remain.This was followed by Ashley ward  (85.6%) in central Bristol, a district featuring ethnic diversity, gentrification and alternative culture.Next highest was Northumberland Park (85.0%) in Haringey, north London, which has a substantial black population. Other wards with available data which had the strongest Remain votes were generally located in Cambridge, Bristol and the multi-ethnic London boroughs of Haringey and Lambeth. The count for Ashburton in Croydon, south London, split 50-50 exactly, with both Leave and Remain getting 3,885 votes, but that did include some postal ballots.As for being nearest to the overall result, the combined count of Tulketh and University, neighbouring wards near the centre of Preston, was 51.92% for leave, very close to the UK wide figure of 51.89%. The individual ward of Barnwood in Gloucester had Leave at 51.94%. Both figures however contain some postal votes.Given that a few councils provided even more detailed data down to the level of polling districts, it is possible to identify some very small localities that were nicely representative of the national picture. The 527 voters in the neighbouring districts of Kirk Langley and Mackworth in Amber Valley in Derbyshire, whose two ballot boxes were counted together, produced a leave proportion of 51.99%. And this figure is not contaminated by any postal votes.So journalists (or anyone else for that matter) who seek a microcosm of the UK should perhaps visit the Mundy Arms pub in Mackworth, the location for that district's polling station.Similarly, the 427 voters in the combined neighbouring polling districts of Chiddingstone Hoath and Hever Four Elms to the south of Sevenoaks in Kent delivered a leave vote of 51.6% (again, without any postal votes).The data obtained points to 269 areas of various sizes (wards, clusters of wards or constituencies) which had a different Leave/Remain outcome compared to the official counting area of which they were part.This consists of 150 areas which backed Remain but were part of Leave-voting counting areas; and 119 in the other direction. The detailed information therefore gives us an understanding of how the electorate voted which is more variegated than the officially published results.Every one of Scotland's 32 counting areas came down on the Remain side. Yet, despite the fact that most Scottish councils did not give us much detailed information, we can nevertheless identify a few smaller parts of the country which actually backed Leave.A cluster of six wards in the Banff and Buchan area in north Aberdeenshire had a strong Leave majority of 61%. There is much local discontent within the fishing industry of this coastal district about the EU's common fisheries policy.An Taobh Siar agus Nis, a ward at the northern end of the Isle of Lewis in Na h-Eileanan an Iar (Western Isles), also voted Leave, if very narrowly. And at a smaller geographical level, in Shetland the 567 voters in the combined polling districts of Whalsay and South Unst had an extremely high Leave vote of 81%. The island of Whalsay is a fishing community, where EU rules have been controversial and in 2012 numerous skippers were heavily fined for major breaches of fishing quotas.Ealing and Hounslow are neighbouring multi-ethnic boroughs in the west of London with large Asian populations, where - in contrast to the national picture - non-white ethnicity was associated with voting Leave, particularly in Ealing. Both boroughs shared a varied internal pattern of prosperous largely white areas voting strongly Remain, poorer largely white areas preferring Leave, and the Asian areas tending to be more evenly split.Ealing voted 60% Remain, with Southfield ward hitting 76%, but in contrast the Southall wards which are over 90% ethnic minority were close to 50-50.In Hounslow the richer wards in Chiswick in the east of the area voted heavily Remain (73%), but the poorer largely white wards at the opposite western end in Feltham and Bedfont voted Leave (64-66%). Osterley and Spring Grove was also 63% Leave, the highest Leave vote in any individual ward in the UK with a non-white majority for which we have data. The south London borough of Bromley narrowly voted Remain. Those parts which did not do so by a significant margin were the Cray Valley wards, largely poor white working class areas; and Biggin Hill and Darwin wards, locations to the south which contain more open countryside and lie outside the built-up commuter belt. In Croydon in south London, places which voted Leave by substantial amounts were New Addington and Fieldway, neighbouring wards with large council estates. Beyond the areas with the strongest backing for Leave and Remain, examining the detailed breakdown of votes in various places gives greater insight into the pattern of support for the two sides - as can be seen from the following examples.In several places (for example, Birmingham, Bristol, Nottingham, Portsmouth) there was a strong contrast between the Leave-voting populations of large, rundown, predominantly white, housing estates in the urban periphery, versus Remain-voting populations in inner city areas with large numbers of ethnic minorities and sometimes students.Birmingham had several wards with large Remain votes, although the city as a whole narrowly voted Leave.  These pro-Remain wards tended to be the more highly educated, better off localities, or minority ethnic areas which strongly backed Remain despite low levels of educational qualifications. I have written about this before. In Blackburn with Darwen, Bastwell ward had the highest Remain vote at 65%, compared to only 44% in the area as a whole. This ward has an ethnic minority proportion of over 90%. Other Blackburn wards which voted Remain were also ones with high minority populations.Bradford voted to Leave (54%), but the area included some starkly contrasting places which went over 60% Remain: the prosperous, genteel, spa town of Ilkley, and strongly ethnic minority wards in the city, such as Manningham and Toller.Bristol voted strongly Remain on the whole (62%), but there were some striking exceptions, particularly the large, deprived, mainly white estates to the south of the city. Hartcliffe and Withywood backed Leave at 67%. Similar neighbouring wards (Hengrove and Whitchurch Park, Filwood, Bishopsworth and Stockwood) also voted Leave, as did the more industrial area of Avonmouth and Lawrence Weston to the north west of the city.As a county Cornwall voted to Leave. But one of its six parliamentary constituencies, Truro and Falmouth, voted 53% to Remain, possibly linked to a significant student population.In Lincoln, which voted 57% to Leave, Carholme ward stands out as very different - it voted 63% to Remain. This ward includes Lincoln University, and 43% of the residents are students Middlesbrough voted 65% to Leave. As already noted, it had several wards with extremely high leave votes of over 75%. But one ward, Linthorpe, voted very narrowly to Remain - a comparatively well-to-do inner suburb which includes an art college; and another ward, Central, which contains Teesside University, nearly did. Mole Valley in Surrey exhibited a dramatic contrast between two neighbouring districts with very different demographics and housing. The highest Remain vote was in the very prosperous location of Dorking South, which voted 63% Remain, but the neighbouring ward of Holmwoods, dominated by large estates on the edge of the town of Dorking, voted 57% Leave, the area's highest Leave vote. Nottingham voted narrowly to Leave, but the inner city ward of Radford and Park voted 68% Remain. This has both a comparatively high proportion of ethnic minorities and considerable numbers of students from two nearby universities. There was a lot of variation within the area. Bulwell - a market town to the north of the city with many social problems - voted 69% Leave  There was also a high Leave vote in the housing estate locations of the Clifton wards in the south of Nottingham.Oldham voted to Leave at 61%, but Werneth, the city ward with the highest ethnic minority population, voted Remain (57%). Other wards with high minority populations also voted Remain.In Oxford the cluster of polling districts which included Blackbird Leys and other deprived estates on the southern edge of the city voted to Leave at 51%. In contrast the central areas containing colleges, university buildings and student accommodation voted to Remain at over 80%.Plymouth voted 60% Leave, but Drake ward which includes the university had the city's highest Remain vote at 56%. Portsmouth was another place with wide variation. Paulsgrove ward, with its large estate on the edge of the city, had the highest Leave vote at 70%, whereas at the other end of the spectrum Central Southsea, an inner city ward and student area, voted 57% Remain.Rochdale voted 60% Leave. The place which bucked this trend by voting 59% Remain, Milkstone and Deeplish, was the most predominantly ethnic minority ward. Central Rochdale had the second highest Remain vote and is the other ward that is mainly not white. Walsall voted strongly Leave (68%). The only ward which voted Remain, Paddock, is both a comparatively prosperous and multi-ethnic locality.A few councils released their data at remarkably localised levels, down even to individual polling districts (ie ballot boxes) in the case of Blackburn with Darwen and Bracknell Forest, or clusters of two/three/four districts, in the case of Amber Valley, Brentwood, Sevenoaks, Shetland, South Oxfordshire, and Tewkesbury.This provides very local and specific data, in some cases just for neighbourhoods of hundreds of voters.At its most detailed this reveals that the 110 people who cast their votes in the ballot box at St. Alban's Primary School in central Blackburn split 56-52 in favour of Remain, with two spoilt papers.It also discloses stark contrasts in some neighbouring locations. The 953 people who voted at Little Harwood community centre in north Blackburn had a Leave vote of only 31%, while the 336 electors who voted in the neighbouring ballot box at Roe Lee Park primary school produced a Leave percentage over twice as high, at 64%.The very detailed data we obtained also provides some rare evidence on the views of postal compared to non-postal voters. Campaign strategists have often deliberated on whether the two groups vote differently and should be given separate targeted messages.Most places mixed boxes of postal and non-postal votes for counting, so generally it's not possible to draw comparative conclusions. However there were a few exceptions which recorded them separately, or included a very small number of non-postal votes with the postals.These figures indicate that postal voters were narrowly less likely to back Leave than voters in polling stations. Data covering five counting areas with about 260,000 votes shows that in these places the roughly one in five electors who voted by post backed Leave at 55.4%, one percentage point lower than the local non-postal support for Leave of 56.4%.The counting areas involved are Amber Valley, East Cambridgeshire, Gwynedd, Hyndburn and North Warwickshire.Since the referendum the BBC has been trying to get the most detailed, localised voting data we could from each of the counting areas.  This was a major data collection exercise carried out by my colleague George Greenwood. We managed to obtain voting figures broken down into smaller geographical units for 178 of the 399 referendum counting areas (380 councils in England, Wales and Scotland, with a separate tally in Gibraltar, while in Northern Ireland results were issued for the 18 constituencies). This varied between data for individual local government wards, wards grouped into clusters, and constituency level data. In a few cases the results supplied were even more localised than ward level. Overall the extra data covers a wide range of different areas and kinds of councils across the UK. Electoral returning officers are not covered by the Freedom of Information Act, so releasing the information was up to the discretion of councils. While some were very willing, in other cases it required a lot of persistence and persuasion. Some councils could not supply any detailed data because they mixed all ballot boxes prior to counting; some did possess more local figures but simply refused to disclose them to us. Others did provide data, but the combinations in which ballot boxes were mixed before counting were too complex to fit ward boundaries neatly.A few places such as Birmingham released their ward by ward data following the referendum on their own initiative, but in most cases the information had to be obtained by us requesting it directly, and sometimes repeatedly, from the authority."

But Sir Gerald, MP for Aldershot, raised a point of order, telling the Commons: ""I was surprised by [the] statement, which had the sort of appearance of an executive order.""He added that traditional clerks' dress was ""key to the dignity of the House"" and had been so ""for several centuries"", adding that MPs ""should discuss this"".Mr Bercow replied that it was ""a matter that can properly be decided by the Speaker"", adding that the House of Commons Commission had approved the changes, which clerks themselves had suggested.  He said that, if one went back more than a ""couple of hundred years"", the situation was different from that presented by Sir Gerald, and that ""several centuries ago"", clerks ""did not wear wigs"".Mr Bercow has refrained from wearing a wig himself in the Commons since becoming Speaker in 2009, as did his predecessors Michael Martin and Betty Boothroyd."

2017-02-06,GM criticised over Vauxhall recall,https://web.archive.org//web/20170207024214/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-38888158,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkMPs have criticised General Motors over its handling of a recall last year after hundreds of Vauxhall Zafira cars caught fire.  At a parliamentary hearing, members of the Commons Transport Committee said the carmaker had treated some customers like ""second-class citizens"".They also said there had been inconsistencies in GM's investigations of the fires. The firm apologised and said it was working to compensate owners. More than 234,000 Vauxhall Zafira B cars were recalled for a second time last year over a technical problem that had caused some models to burst into flames. Vauxhall have said the blazes were caused by improper repairs to the heating and ventilation system.Evira Toelkes, vice-president of quality at GM Europe, told MPs the firm had written 1.2 million letters to owners seeking a recall and managed to fix 165,000 cars.She also said that extra technicians had been deployed to speed up the repairs.However, SNP politician Stewart Malcolm McDonald said customers had made numerous complaints about the firm's handling of the process, with some forming a group to lobby Parliament. ""Some customers were made to feel like a nuisance or were met with disgust at dealerships,"" he said.""Vehicles were often returned to them with further problems with the heating and ventilation system.""He added: ""I can't think of another product in the United Kingdom at the moment where people have set up a campaign group and come to Parliament to try and resolve it.""Helen Foord, head of government relations at GM, said the firm's dealers had since been issued with guidance on how to handle the complaints better.""Our dealers were trying to make the recall process as smooth and easy for customers as possible, but we understand that might not be the case the whole time and we apologise for the additional inconvenience,"" she said. The executives were also criticised for having launched 59 investigations into the damaged vehicles, despite knowing of 287 reported fires.Thomas Berenz - director of global safety and field investigations at GM - said GM had not been able to access all of the vehicles. This was because customers had not always given permission to investigate, while some vehicles may have been scrapped, he said."
2017-02-06,Upfront charges for foreign patients,https://web.archive.org//web/20170207024214/http://www.bbc.com/news/health-38876527,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkNHS hospitals in England will have a legal duty to charge overseas patients upfront for non-urgent care if they are not eligible for free treatment.From April this year, foreign patients could be refused operations unless they cover their costs in advance.NHS Improvement, which oversees the trusts, said hospitals would no longer have to chase money they are owed.Emergency treatment will continue to be provided and invoiced later.The announcement from Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt comes amid recent headlines about the cost of tourists using the NHS.A BBC documentary, Hospital, showed a number of foreign patients unable to pay their bills.Hospitals are already supposed to charge patients living outside the European Economic Area for care such as hip operations or cataract removal, but this can be done by invoice, rather than upfront.Details of treatment given to visitors from EEA countries should be forwarded to the Department of Health so the costs can be recouped from their governments.But earlier last week, MPs on the Public Accounts Committee said the system for recovering costs from foreign visitors was ""chaotic"".Mr Hunt said: ""We have no problem with overseas visitors using our NHS - as long as they make a fair contribution, just as the British taxpayer does.""The health secretary said the aim was to recover up to £500m a year by the middle of this Parliament to reinvest in the NHS. A report by the National Audit Office last October suggested that money raised next year would fall far short of this target.A Nigerian woman owes £330,000 after giving birth prematurely to quadruplets in a west London hospital.Priscilla, whose case was highlighted in the BBC documentary Hospital, was taken ill on a flight home from the US and ended up in St Mary's A&E, after her plane stopped over at Heathrow Airport.Her bill is thought to be among the largest unpaid by an overseas patient - but she has no ability to pay it.Priscilla would still have received urgent treatment under the new arrangements because her life and those of her babies - two of whom died - were at risk.The NHS Imperial College Trust, which includes St Mary's, spent £4m on overseas patients in 2016 and managed to recoup £1.6m.The changes mean that from April, foreign visitors needing urgent care will still be treated immediately on the NHS and invoiced if they are not to be eligible for free care. But they will also be told upfront that their care is chargeable before treatment begins.It will be up to individual trusts to work out how best to check eligibility. It is thought some trusts will ask overseas patients to produce two forms of identification - including one showing a UK address. Dr Meirion Thomas, a former cancer surgeon at the Royal Marsden Hospital, told Radio 4's Today programme that the plan was a ""smokescreen"".""It is not going to work because there are not trained people to identify and charge overseas visitors upfront,"" he said, highlighting an example where there was one overseas visitor manager - who identifies those who do not qualify for free NHS healthcare - for three hospitals in London.""Anyone going into any of the Schengen countries, when they apply for a visitor's visa, they have to prove that they have 30,000 euros worth of health and travel insurance and that is the cure for this problem in this country.""A week of coverage by BBC News examining the state of the NHS across the UK as it comes under intense pressure during its busiest time of the year.The doctors' union, the BMA, warned of potential ""chaos and confusion"" from the changes.

2017-02-06,Thousands get Concentrix benefits review,https://web.archive.org//web/20170207024214/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-38873311,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThousands more families who were wrongly stripped of their tax credits by the US contractor Concentrix are to have their cases reviewed.A committee of MPs that produced a scathing report on Concentrix said on Monday that HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) had accepted its recommendations.Concentrix was sacked by HMRC last year after many low income and vulnerable people were left without credits.The Work and Pensions Committee said up to 23,000 new cases will be looked at.Concentrix was used by HMRC to help cut fraud and correct errors in the tax credit system, but faced a barrage of criticism.In a report to MPs, the government disclosed that of 36,000 claimants who lodged an appeal against a ruling by Concentrix, 87% were upheld and have had their benefits reinstated.But now the remaining 23,000 claimants who did not appeal will have their cases reviewed as well, the government has told the Work and Pensions Committee (PWC) The MPs said the appeals process was ""complex"" and ""daunting"", and there was ""no doubt"" that some claimants who did not appeal had rightful benefits stopped.Concentrix claimant 'still in debt' HMRC steps in to sort out tax creditsMother 'accused of marriage to dead man'In a statement to the committee, the government said: ""HMRC will review those cases to establish that decisions made by Concentrix were properly made and communicated to claimants.""Where absolutely necessary, we will re-contact the claimant to request further information relating to their claim. Current plans indicate that this activity could be completed by March 2017 but the scope of this work will be confirmed once an analysis of the total cost has been produced.""Frank Field, chairman of the Work and Pensions Committee (PWC), welcomed the government's agreement to accept their recommendations.In its report, the committee said that right from the outset claimants found the system was ""stacked against them"".The ""merest hint"" that a claim contained more than a ""zero risk"" of fraud or error was enough to trigger a compliance check, with those who did not - or could not - reply being treated as guilty until proven innocent.Mr Field said: ""HMRC was right to fire its contractor, but many of the processes used by Concentrix were the same as those used by HMRC itself. ""For many claimants, particularly those who were unwell, lacked self-confidence or had caring responsibilities, the document-heavy process of challenging a wrong decision by Concentrix was surely prohibitively daunting""Mr Field added: ""The real answer is of course to root out fraud and error at entry to the system rather than stopping benefits in payment as first resort.""A HMRC spokesman said: ""It is important to make checks on tax credits payments to ensure the right people are receiving them under the law, and this work will now be done by HMRC.""We will not be entering into external contracts for this in future. We apologise to all those who did not receive the standard of service that they should have."""
2017-02-06,Netanyahu and May discuss Iran threat,https://web.archive.org//web/20170207024214/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38879100,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkTheresa May has hosted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for talks in Downing Street.Mrs May restated concerns over settlement building in the West Bank, while Mr Netanyahu warned that Iran posed a threat to Europe, after it test-fired a ballistic missile.The UK prime minister failed to greet her Israeli counterpart when he arrived because of a mix-up over timings.The meeting was the first to take place face-to-face between the two leaders.It came after the UK backed a United Nations Security Council resolution in December denouncing Israel's settlements in occupied Palestinian territory as a ""flagrant violation"" of international law and a ""major obstacle"" to a just and lasting peace.Analysis: By BBC diplomatic correspondent Jonathan MarcusThere is a certain symmetry between the British and Israeli prime ministers' situations. Both are experiencing tensions with longstanding friends - Mrs May with Europe over Brexit and Mr Netanyahu with many of the same countries over settlement construction and the failing hopes for Palestinian statehood. Both are increasingly reliant upon close ties with Washington but are uncertain about just where the Trump Administration is heading. Mr Netanyahu wants to consolidate the relationship with Mrs May - who leads one of the more pro-Israeli governments in the EU. He also wants her support in standing up to Iran's rising influence in the Middle East. Mrs May will stress Britain's opposition to Israeli settlement construction and her continuing support for the Iran nuclear deal. But beyond that there is room for stronger ties, not least in the economic area where Israel's championing of high-tech industry is seen as a positive model to emulate.Before Mr Netanyahu's arrival, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""Theresa May must make clear to the Israeli prime minister that the British government will stand unequivocally behind the rights of the Palestinian people, along with the many who support them in Israel, as well as human rights and justice across the region.""Mrs May's spokeswoman said the prime minister was reiterating ""our long-standing position to make clear that we see the continued increase in settlement activity undermining trust"".The UK would continue to push for ""a twin-track approach"" to the Middle East peace process which also recognised Israel's right to be safe from terrorism, she added.The US has imposed sanctions on Iran following the testing of a missile - reportedly a medium-range ballistic missile - last month.The UK was one of the signatories to the 2015 international agreement by which Iran agreed to curb its nuclear programme in return for the lifting of economic penalties.At the start of his meeting with Mrs May, Mr Netanyahu said: ""Iran seeks to annihilate Israel. It seeks to conquer the Middle East. It threatens Europe. It threatens the West. It threatens the world. And it offers provocation after provocation.""He added: ""That's why I welcome President Trump's assistance of new sanctions against Iran. I think other nations should follow suit, certainly responsible nations."" Mrs May's spokeswoman said: ""We share concerns about that test. It was discussed at the UN and we made clear our position.""With regard to the specific agreement relating to the nuclear weapons... it's important that it is very carefully and rigorously policed, but we should also be clear that it has neutralised the possibility of the Iranians acquiring nuclear weapons for more than a decade.""Their first meeting got off to an awkward start after Mr Netanyahu arrived two minutes early and she failed to meet him at the door of No 10, leaving him in the street for a short time before he entered alone.The pair emerged around two minutes later to shake hands in front of the assembled media. They did not hold a press conference."

She was ordered to make an interim payment of £120,000.That sum, plus the total of £162,000 damages, must be paid within 21 days.Ms Collins was sued by the MPs for libel and slander after she alleged that each of them knew many of the details of the exploitation, yet deliberately chose to do nothing.She made the speech at a UKIP conference a month after a report found that about 1,400 children in the area had been abused between 1997 and 2013.The High Court heard the MEP also expressed the opinion that the MPs had acted out of political correctness, political cowardice or political selfishness and were guilty of misconduct so grave that it was or should be criminal, as it aided the perpetrators.Ms Collins had refused to withdraw her comments throughout the whole of the campaign, had not apologised and had repeatedly tried to delay the litigation.Gavin Millar QC told Mr Justice Warby that the allegations had been the ""talk of the tearoom"" in Parliament in the run-up to the 2015 general election and caused ""extreme distress"".The judge said all three MPs found the experience ""genuinely and significantly distressing"".He said: ""They felt that their careers were at stake, and that their integrity was under serious attack.""Ms Collins argued she had made a political speech that did not contain any allegation of fact, but expressed an opinion to the effect that the MPs were likely to have known that sexual exploitation was a serious problem in the area.She made an offer of amends which was accepted, but the amount of compensation could not be agreed.At the High Court, Ms Collins was refused permission to appeal in the case although she can renew her application to the Court of Appeal.In a joint statement, the MPs said the process of clearing their names had been ""dragged out"" for two years and had been delayed by Ms Collins' repeated attempts to evade justice.Mr Healey said: ""All three of us are very relieved and very glad to get the full vindication from the judge today, who has comprehensively ruled against Jane Collins.""The statement said Ms Collins had ""tried every trick in the book"" but ""run out of places to hide"".Ms Collins said she had no comment to make at the moment.Ms Champion told the BBC: ""It has taken two and a half years and we've still not got an apology, and to be quite honest I doubt if we'll ever get a penny.""When she made up lies against us we asked for a written apology and for £30,000 that we could give to local Rotherham charities which support abuse survivors.""Sir Kevin said it changed what people in Rotherham thought of him, and that he was called ""difficult things"" during the 2015 general election campaign, including a ""paedophile"".Ms Champion said: ""I think she did it [during the campaign] to create political damage. Using child abuse for political gain - it's immoral."""
2017-02-06,Government vows to do more for renters,https://web.archive.org//web/20170207024214/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38873524,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe government is promising a new emphasis on people who rent their homes when it unveils its housing strategy for England this week.Housing Minister Gavin Barwell said there would be minimum tenancies and more homes built for rent in a ""change of tone"" from previous Tory policy.He said the government had not given up making home ownership available to all.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the rental market was ""incapable of giving people the security they need"".Speaking on the BBC's Sunday Politics, Housing Minister Gavin Barwell said a package of measures would be in the White Paper due to be published on Tuesday.These will aim to encourage more investment in building homes for affordable rent, which he defined as at least 20% below the market rate, with councils encouraged to get more involved.Ministers have previously announced letting agents in England will be banned from charging fees to tenants.The last Conservative general election manifesto said ""everyone who works hard should be able to own a home of their own"", and Mr Barwell said the government was still committed to reversing the decline in home ownership.But he said the government also had to have ""something to say"" to renters who were facing unaffordable costs.There are an estimated 4.3 million tenants in the private rental market.""Whether you're trying to buy or you're trying to rent, housing in this country has become less and less affordable because for 30 or 40 years governments have not built enough homes and this White Paper is fundamentally trying to do something about that,"" Mr Barwell said.The focus on rentable homes was welcomed by Rico Wojtulewicz of the House Builders' Association, which represents small and medium-sized house builders.Mr Wojtulewicz said that if small and medium enterprises were better enabled to build, ""you get the right type of homes in the right areas"".He told the BBC: ""Concentrating too much on volume house-building, as we've seen in the last decade, is problematic - not just for supply, but the type of supply.""Rob Warm from the National Housing Federation said many people in the rented sector are receiving a ""very poor"" and ""insecure service"".He said:"" I think those people deserve better and what government is saying today shows that they think these people deserve better as well.""Mark Lobel, BBC political correspondentIt's been a long-cherished notion in the Conservative Party that people want to own their own homes.From Margaret Thatcher's sale of council houses in the 1980s, to David Cameron's Help to Buy scheme offering generous loans for first-time buyers.In the forthcoming housing White Paper, Help to Buy and other schemes should remain but the Housing Minister Gavin Barwell said people should expect a change of tone too.More help is promised for those who cannot afford to own, or prefer to rent - by cutting rents and increasing the length of tenancy agreements.Planning rules will be amended to allow more homes to be built for rent and developers will be encouraged to offer cheaper rents in lieu of their affordable home obligations. Mr Barwell acknowledged that the most recent figures showing the number of new affordable homes at a 24-year low were ""embarrassing"", but said this was because they came at the start of a new five-year programme.And he insisted the government was committed to building one million new homes in England by 2020, despite being ""behind schedule"".He said the government would not make any changes to the current rules on the green belt, which allow building only in ""exceptional circumstances"".""This idea that we can only fix our broken housing market by taking huge swathes out of the green belt is not true,"" he added.But Labour has said the proposals on build-to-rent fall far short of what is needed.Mr Corbyn added: ""The private rented market is incapable of dealing with demand, incapable of giving people the security they need, and particularly in our major cities, it is so expensive that it means many poorer, middle-income, working-class families are getting moved out.""He called for investment in council housing and regulation of the private rented sector.Where can I afford to live?"
2017-02-06,"Scrap free nursery hours, report says",https://web.archive.org//web/20170207024214/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-38879909,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe free entitlement to childcare for all parents in England should be scrapped in favour of a system aimed at disadvantaged children, a report says.The Institute of Economic Affairs study says the right to 15 hours free care a week has distorted the market price.It also argues regulations have made it more costly, with many families on average earnings spending more than a third of their income on childcare.The government says it is investing £6bn a year on the facility.The report argues that despite this investment, families are still paying huge sums for people to look after their children.The way early years care is funded means that those who need help the most do not receive it, while many affluent families are generously subsidised, the report found.It also highlighted what it described as ""inequitable cross-subsidisation"", where parents are required to pay high fees for a few extra hours,  because the government funding rates are so low that the richer parents, seeking more hours, are effectively topping up the government's contribution.Join the conversation - find us on FacebookCurrently, parents of three and four-year-olds in England are entitled to 15 hours free childcare a week, but this is due to increase to 30 hours from September.And providers say that nursery costs for parents could ""sky-rocket"" in some areas as providers grapple with less funding for the scheme.The report also argues that attempts to improve the quality of childcare have ended up increasing the amount of regulation, while failing to produce better outcomes.However, previous attempts by the government to change the ratio of children to carers were met with resistance from childcare providers, who said the changes would not lead to savings.The report said the system has also limited choice for parents as alternative forms of care such as home-based childminders are priced out of the sector.Len Shackleton, co-author of the report, said: ""Government interventions in the childcare sector have resulted in both British families and taxpayers bearing a heavy burden of expensive provision.""Regulation has led to an excessive formalisation of childcare and pre-school, which has not only pushed up costs but paid scant attention to parental preferences.""Many families may not want the structured form of pre-school that the government requires as standard.""At a time when many families are facing a cost of living crisis, it is important the government rethinks its involvement in childcare. Rowing back on unnecessary regulation and focusing public funds on those who need it, rather than subsidising the well-off, would be a good way to start.""Gayle Paris, a mother who contacted us via Facebook, said she found it difficult to use the free childcare allowance as it had to be taken over five days.""If less affluent families aren't taking up the place, it is because they have less flexible working arrangements, and are likely not to be able to afford a private nursery to take partnership funding. ""Taking the opportunity of pre-school in the local authority away from those with more income is not a solution. Local authority pre-school is a good step into school for three to four-year-olds. ""Re-arrange the system so those working full time can better access it and the uptake among less affluent families will rise.""While Craig Chew-Moulding said less parents would go back to work, if the subsidies were withdrawn, as it would not make economic sense. Neil Leitch, chief executive the Pre-School Learning Alliance, said: ""Yes, childcare is expensive, but reducing regulations - for example by abandoning rules around staff to child ratios - is not the way to reduce costs. When the government tried to relax ratios in 2012 parents and providers were overwhelmingly opposed to the proposals.He added: ""While we appreciate there are flaws in the government's early years policy - not least doubling the free entitlement from 15 to 30 hours without properly analysing how to fund the scheme - to remove state intervention entirely, as this report suggests, would be fool-hardy at best, and downright dangerous at worst.""A Department for Education spokesman said helping families with high quality, affordable childcare was at the heart of the government's agenda.""That's why we are investing a record £6bn per year by 2020,"" he said.""Our 30 hours free offer for three and four-year-olds is set to save working parents up to £5,000 per year and we're also supporting the most disadvantaged families through our free 15 hours offer for two-year-olds and our pupil premium - worth over £300 a year per eligible child. ""We make no apologies for regulations which keep children safe and well."" "

2017-02-06,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20170207024214/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThis article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide to the UK's vote to leave the European Union. It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 52% to 48%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%, as did Wales, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who resigned on the day after losing the referendum. Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she says she will respect the will of the people. She has said ""Brexit means Brexit"" but there is still a lot of debate about what that will mean in practice especially on the two key issues of how British firms do business in the European Union and what curbs are brought in on the rights of European Union nationals to live and work in the UK. She set out more details of her negotiating hopes in her key speech on Brexit.The UK economy appears to have weathered the initial shock of the Brexit vote, although the value of the pound remains near a 30-year low, but opinion is sharply divided over the long-term effects of leaving the EU. Some major firms such as Easyjet and John Lewis have pointed out that the slump in sterling has increased their costs. Britain also lost its top AAA credit rating, meaning the cost of government borrowing will be higher. But share prices have recovered from a dramatic slump in value, with both the FTSE 100 and the broader FTSE 250 index, which includes more British-based businesses, trading higher than before the referendum. The Bank of England cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - a record low and the first cut since 2009 - after the vote and there has not been the economic slump or recession that some had predicted. Here is a regularly updated detailed rundown of how Britain's economy is doingThe European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it has to invoke an agreement called Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May has said she intends to trigger this process by the end of March 2017, meaning the UK will be expected to have left by the summer of 2019, depending on the precise timetable agreed during the negotiations. The government will also enact a Great Repeal Bill which will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. It is expected to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove.After a court battle, the UK's Supreme Court has ruled that Parliament must be consulted before Article 50 is invoked. This is why a two line Brexit bill is currently making its way through Parliament. MPs and Lords have to vote on it.The court verdict was not what the government argued for, but ministers have insisted it will not delay their planned timetable.Most MPs are expected to vote in favour of Article 50 being triggered, although there could be attempts to amend the draft legislation.Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These men - dubbed the Three Brexiteers - will play a central role in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although it will be Mrs May, as prime minister, who will have the final say. The government did not do any emergency planning for Brexit ahead of the referendum and Mrs May has rejected calls to say what her negotiating goals are.Once Article 50 has been triggered, the UK will have two years to negotiate its withdrawal. But no one really knows how the Brexit process will work - Article 50 was only created in late 2009 and it has never been used. Former Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, now Chancellor, wanted Britain to remain in the EU, and he has suggested it could take up to six years for the UK to complete exit negotiations. The terms of Britain's exit will have to be agreed by 27 national parliaments, a process which could take some years, he has argued. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. The UK will continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making.Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Following Theresa May's Brexit recent speech we now know that the UK is not intending to stay in the EU's single market. Although there has been speculation for months about the issue, it would have meant the UK staying under the auspices of the European Court of Justice and having to allow unlimited EU immigration, under freedom of movement rules.Both sides want trade to continue after Brexit with the UK seeking a positive outcome for those who wish to trade goods and services"" - such as those in the City of London and wanting a ""comprehensive free trade deal"" giving the UK ""the greatest possible access"" to the single market. Mrs May says she wants the UK to reach a new customs union deal with the EU. A customs union is where countries agree not to impose tariffs on each others' goods and have a common tariff on goods coming in from elsewhere. The UK is currently part of the EU customs union but that stops the UK being able to do its own trade deals with other countries. Reality Check: How could customs union work?These terms have increasingly been used as debate focused on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people in order to maintain access to the EU single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result.The government has declined to give a firm guarantee about the status of EU nationals currently living in the UK, saying this is not possible without a reciprocal pledge from other EU members about the millions of British nationals living on the continent. EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, will be be able to stay, the chief civil servant at the Home Office has said. The rights of other EU nationals would be subject to negotiations on Brexit and the ""will of Parliament"", he added.A lot depends on the kind of deal the UK agrees with the EU. If it remains within the single market, it would almost certainly retain free movement rights, allowing UK citizens to work in the EU and vice versa. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.Again, it depends on whether the UK government decides to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages. Citizens' Advice has reminded people their rights have not changed yet and asked anyone to contact them if they think they have been discriminated against following the Leave vote.Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested EU migrants who come to the UK as Brexit nears may not be given the right to stay. He has said there might have to be a cut-off point if there was a ""surge"" in new arrivals.People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote.The day-to-day spending impact is likely to be more significant. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it to remain at least 10% below where it was on 23 June, in the long term. This means imported goods will consequently get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have already been seen and the issue was most notably illustrated by the dispute between Tesco and Marmite's makers about whether prices would be put up or not in the stores.The latest UK inflation figures, for December, showed the CPI inflation rate jumping to 1.6%, its highest level for two years with signs of more cost pressures set to feed through in the months to come.Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration.She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations. As mentioned above, the key issue is whether other EU nations will grant the UK access to the single market, if that is what it wants, while at the same time being allowed to restrict the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK.Mrs May has said she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. It is currently running at 330,000 a year, of which 184,000 are EU citizens, and 188,000 are from outside the EU - the figures include a 39,000 outflow of UK citizens.It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Liberal Democrats - who have just a handful of MPs - have vowed to halt Brexit and keep Britain in the EU if they were to win the next general election.Some commentators, including former House of Commons clerk Lord Lisvane, have argued that a further referendum would be needed to ratify whatever deal the UK hammers out with the EU, but there are few signs political leaders view this as a viable option.Yes. Theresa May has appeared keen to avoid a vote on her negotiating stance, to avoid having to give away her priorities, but Theresa May has said there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. It is worth mentioning that any deal also has to be agreed by the European Parliament - with British MEPs getting a chance to vote on it there.  While there could be limitations on British nationals' ability to live and work in EU countries, it seems unlikely they would want to deter tourists. There are many countries outside the European Economic Area, which includes the 28 EU nations plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway, that British citizens can visit for up to 90 days without needing a visa and it is possible that such arrangements could be negotiated with European countries.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. In theory, the government could, if it wanted, decide to change the colour, which is currently standardised for EU countries, says the BBC's Europe correspondent, Chris Morris.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketNo nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it is ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faces being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. A second independence referendum for the country is now ""highly likely"", she has said, although not in 2017. She has said she wants Scotland to stay in the single market and said Mrs May's decision to rule out the UK staying in the single market ""undoubtedly"" brings the referendum closer.Before his resignation Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said the impact in Northern Ireland would be ""very profound"" and that the whole island of Ireland should now be able to vote on reunification. But, speaking while she was still Northern Ireland Secretary, Theresa Villiers ruled out the call from Sinn Féin for a border poll, saying the circumstances in which one would be called did not exist. The land border is likely to be a key part of the Brexit talks. Theresa May said a priority for her would be negotiating a deal with the EU which allowed a common travel area between the UK and the Republic of Ireland.During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest. But his successor Theresa May has said she will keep it in place, at least for the current Parliament, which is due to last until 2020.So far there has been a cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. There are yet to be signs that rising inflation have worried the Bank of England  enough to consider raising interest rates.  But if that happened it would make mortgages and loans more expensive to repay - but would be good news for savers.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.Eurotunnel boss Jacques Gounon said last November the reintroduction of duty-free would be ""an incredible boost for my business"" but he later said  that remark had been ""light-hearted"". Erik Juul-Mortensen, president of the Tax Free World Association (TFWA) said after the referendum vote ""it is not possible to predict how Brexit will affect the duty free and travel retail industry, and it is wiser not to make assumptions about exactly what the impact will be.""  They are at the moment but no-one knows the longer term prospects for definite. The EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - is not an EU initiative. It was negotiated between countries within a group known as the European Economic Area, often simply referred to as the single market (plus Switzerland, which confusingly is not a member of the EEA, but has agreed access to the single market). Therefore, the future of Britons' EHIC cover could depend on whether the UK decided to sever ties with the EEA.Probably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report. In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two-thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.However, the UK government is committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, the UK government is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR. However, the EU has its own European Court of Justice, whose decisions are binding on EU institutions and member states.Its rulings have sometimes caused controversy in Britain and supporters of a Brexit have called for immediate legislation to curb its powers. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also cited sovereignty and democracy, and they wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Four of the biggest US banks have committed to helping maintain the City's position. But HSBC will move up to 1,000 jobs to Paris, the BBC understands. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Pest control firm Rentokil Initial says it could make £15m extra this year thanks to a weaker currency.Others are less optimistic. Hilary Jones, a director at UK cosmetics firm Lush said the company was ""terrified"" about the economic impact. She added that while the firm's Dorset factory would continue to produce goods for the UK market, products for the European market may be made at its new plant in Germany.Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After the Leave vote, the government will probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""As with most elements of the UK economy, not enough solid data has been published yet to accurately conclude the Brexit effect on house prices. Industry figures have pointed to ""uncertainty"" among buyers and sellers that could potentially change the housing market.So far, the most significant research has come from the respected Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which has published the conclusions of a survey of its members. This primarily records sentiment among surveyors.It found that house prices are expected to fall across the UK in the three months after the referendum vote. However, the dip in prices is only expected to persist over the 12 months from June in London and East Anglia, surveyors predict.House prices were already slowing in central London, owing to the fall-out from changes to stamp duty rules in April.Separate figures from property portal Rightmove suggested the average asking price of houses coming on to the market in England and Wales fell by 0.9%, or £2,647, in July compared with June. It said that agents had reported very few sales had fallen through as a result of the vote.Many potential first-time buyers would welcome a fall in house prices, with ownership among the young falling owing to affordability concerns. Investors in property, or those who have paid off a mortgage and hope to leave homes as inheritance would be unhappy with a long-term reduction in value.  Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law following the decision to leave the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" will not necessarily disappear overnight - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU means the UK will not be part of TTIP. It will have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Former Labour health secretary Lord Owen has said that because of TTIP (see answer above) the only way to protect the NHS from further privatisation was to get out of the EU."

None of the four nations is achieving any of its three key targets for A&E, cancer or routine treatments, such as knee and hip replacements.All have developed plans and strategies to deal with the common challenges - rising demand, squeezes on funding and the ageing population. But each has found this winter to be particularly difficult. Spending: £2,057 per personKey fact: Just one hospital trust hit the four-hour A&E target in the first week of January.The system: The NHS is split between providers of services, known as NHS trusts, and commissioners, working for clinical commissioning groups. Social care, covering care homes and help in the home, is organised by councils and is means-tested.The story so far: The first week of January was the most difficult since the four-hour target was introduced in 2014. The proportion of patients being treated or discharged in time fell below 78%, with nearly half of hospitals declaring major alerts because of a shortage of beds.An estimated one in five patients ended up facing long delays for a bed after an emergency admission - double the normal rate - while ambulance crews reported problems handing over patients to A&E staff.It comes after a gradual increase in pressures in recent years. The winters have been getting progressively worst, while the 62-day target for cancer treatment to begin following an urgent GP referral has been missed for 11 months in a row. The number of people on hospital waiting lists for a routine operation has also been rising.NHS bosses set out a five-year vision for the NHS, which involved a greater emphasis on keeping people well in the community. But savings also have to be made - there is a £22bn target for 2020. This has led to the development of 44 local plans to overhaul services - some of which involve closing hospitals and cutting staff.Spending: £2,125 per personKey fact: 63% of A&E patients were seen in four hours over the Christmas period.The system: There are five integrated health and care boards that run hospitals, community services and social care. The over-75s get free care in their own home if they have high needs.The story so far: Northern Ireland has some of the worst performance figures in the UK. During the Christmas period, the number of patients seen in four hours in A&E departments dropped to 63%.Exactly the same proportion started their cancer treatment within 62 days, according to the latest statistics, while the numbers waiting longer than they should for a routine operation have almost doubled in the past four years.In response to the growing pressures, ministers have already set out a new vision for the health service, which they acknowledged was at ""breaking point"". A 10-year plan was published in the autumn, which called for greater investment in general practice as a way of coping with the rising demands on hospitals.The plan was widely criticised for its lack of detail and costings. It did not mention hospital closures, but there is a general consensus that Northern Ireland has too many small units and care would be better concentrated in fewer bigger centres.Political instability in Northern Ireland, which is facing its second assembly election in less than a year, also means the budget for the next financial year has yet to be agreed.Spending: £2,160 per personKey fact: Scotland was the last nation to hits its A&E target - in July.The system: The NHS is run by 14 health boards that organise hospital and community services. Social care is organised by councils with personal care - that is help with  washing and dressing - provided free in people's homes and residential care if an individual has high needs. The story so far: Out of all the four nations, hospitals in Scotland seem to have fared the best. Weekly data shows four-hour performance in major units hovering around the 90% mark during January.Much of the credit has been given to the way councils and the health service are working together. Budgets have been pooled, encouraging a close working relationship to help get frail patients out of hospital by providing extra rehabilitation services in the community.But most of the progress has been concentrated in and around Glasgow and Edinburgh, where over a quarter of the population lives. Arguably, this gives Scotland an advantage, as improvements in just two regions can have a significant impact on performance.In terms of cancer treatment, over 87% started treatment within 62 days, according to the latest figures, below the 95% target.Spending: £2,084 per personKey fact: 81% of patients were seen in four hours in A&E during December.The system: The NHS is run by seven health boards that organise hospital and community services. Social care is organised by councils, which cap the cost of home care at £60 a week. The story so far: NHS Wales boss Dr Andrew Goodall has described the pressures seen this winter as ""exceptional"". Some hospitals have been reporting a 10% rise in admissions compared with 12 months previously, while the ambulance services said the start of the year had been the busiest on record.The government invested an extra £50m to help hospitals deal with winter pressures and this paid for an extra 400 beds - the equivalent of one more district general hospital.But the numbers being seen in four hours during December dropped to 81% - well below the 95% target.And the numbers waiting over 12 hours nearly hit 2,500 - a rise of two-thirds on the same period the year before.Wales has become the first part of the UK to redefine how it deals with 999 calls. Instead of requiring ambulances to reach a third of calls in eight minutes, it narrowed the number of conditions needing an urgent response and now just aims for this in abut 5% of cases. Ambulance bosses say this has allowed the service to use its fleet more effectively, which means the most life-threatening cases are getting quicker treatment.Over 86% of patients given an urgent GP referral get cancer treatment within 62-days - some way short of the 95% target.Do you have a question about the NHS?

2017-02-06,And we're off,https://web.archive.org//web/20170207024214/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38830552,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkIt's begun. After decades of debate, years of acrimony over the issue in the Conservative Party, months of brutal brinksmanship in Westminster, and hours of debate this week, MPs have just approved the very first step in the process of Britain leaving the European Union. There are many hurdles ahead, probably thousands of hours of debate here, years of negotiations for Theresa May with our friends and rivals around the EU, as she seeks a deal - and possibly as long as a decade of administrative adjustments, as the country extricates itself from the EU. On a wet Wednesday, the debate didn't feel epoch-making, but think for a moment about what has just happened. MPs, most of whom wanted to stay in the EU, have just agreed that we are off.  This time last year few in Westminster really thought that this would happen. The then prime minister's concern was persuading the rest of the EU to give him a better deal for the UK. His close colleagues believed the chances of them losing, let alone the government dissolving over the referendum, were slim, if not quite zero.Then tonight, his former colleagues are rubber stamping the decision of a narrow majority of the public, that changed everything in politics here for good. This isn't even the  last vote on this bill. There are several more stages, the Lords are likely to kick up rough at the start. But after tonight, for better or worse, few will believe that our journey to the exit door can be halted.As government ministers have said in recent days, the moment for turning back is past. "
2017-02-06,Brexit debate notes,https://web.archive.org//web/20170207024214/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-parliaments-38833310,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkI've got five take-outs from the Article 50 bill so far.There may be 101 pages of amendments down so far, but the government is in no mood to take any of them on board; on the contrary, their aim is to repel boarders, to the point where they would even resist the one amendment being mooted by the Brexiteer camp, which would aim to forbid ministers from accepting any extra time to extend the two year negotiating window specified by the EU's Lisbon Treaty. Ministers do believe that the EU's Michel Barnier's strategy is to enmesh the UK in a long-term negotiating limbo, perhaps including a post-Brexit transitional deal, but they don't want their hands tied.Many of the amendments, thus far, look like the product of an amendment generating bot, standard stuff about laying reports and regular debates. But ministers are wary of some of the substantive ones setting conditions - and in particular of the emotive issue of EU nationals resident in Britain, a matter now featuring regularly in most MPs' constituency surgeries. There is strong pressure for some kind of unilateral move for the UK to guarantee their right to remain - but, the government retorts, if that was passed, its backers would be to blame if one or two European states didn't reciprocate and allow UK nationals to stay within their borders.In the debate, Labour's frontbench Brexit spokesman, Sir Keir Starmer, looked and sounded like a lawyer delivering a plea in mitigation on behalf of a convicted prisoner. Early in his speech, he appealed to the Commons for a courteous hearing - something his opposite number, David Davis, would never have got away with. It just about worked, because the House genuinely wanted to hear what he had to say, but he does suffer from the lawyer-turned politician's tendency to address MPs as if they were the Court of Appeal. But leaving aside the style points, forging a line on Brexit which can stitch together the strongly pro-Brexit and strongly pro-Remain elements of Labour's heartland, let alone unify the deeply divided Parliamentary Labour Party, may prove an impossible challenge.Whether it's in the leadership ratings in Conservative Home, where he has now edged ahead of the prime minister herself, or in the growls of approval from his colleagues in the regular statements in the chamber, the Brexit Secretary, David Davis, increasingly commands the status of second minister in this government. This is not a wholly comfortable place to be - flying perilously near to the Sun - but as someone reconciled, not that long ago, to seeing out their parliamentary career on the backbenches, I suspect Mr Davis can bear it. The Lib Dems have sought to position themselves as the last champions of the Remain cause (although two of their MPs, Norman Lamb and Greg Mulholland have promised to abstain on the Article 50 Bill). But they can't claim to be the arch-opponents of Brexit and fail to maintain a presence for the big debates on it - and their leader, Tim Farron, had a chastening time at PMQs when this was pointed out. In truth, their much-reduced parliamentary party has been pretty bad at showing the flag, since the last election. It's rare to see all nine Lib Dem MPs on the green benches. This is one area where they are not very good at remaining. "

The House of Commons says: ""All petitions are checked for fraudulent activity, using both automated and manual checks. The checks prevent fraudulent signatures being added to petitions by individuals trying to repeatedly sign, or automated attacks (bots).""It adds that there is a balance to be made between making it easy for people to sign while making it harder to do so repeatedly.The procedures have been tightened up since last June, when at least 77,000 fraudulent signatures were removed from a petition calling for a second EU referendum.An investigation was launched after posts were found on websites from people claiming to have written programs that would automatically sign the petition thousands of times.The House of Commons will not give details of either the original or new security procedures it has put in place.It is not immediately obvious how the system works to prevent people voting more than once, but fraudulent signatures have been disqualified in the past. It should be said that both petitions have received considerably more than the 100,000 signatures, above which petitions ""almost always"" trigger a debate in Parliament.Read more from Reality Check"

2017-02-06,State visit politics,https://web.archive.org//web/20170207024214/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-38808647,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkA state visit is the ultimate weapon of British diplomacy, the bunker buster of soft power that can break down the hardest of tyrannical hearts. Few world leaders can resist the siren lure of all that royal bling: horse-drawn coaches, state banquets, processions down the Mall, the sheer scale of all that gold leaf and pomp and flummery that allows them a brief window into a royal fantasy that many countries envy but can rarely match. This weapon is deployed sparingly, normally no more than twice a year. But it does get used. If Donald Trump does touch down for a little red carpet treatment later this year, it will be the 110th time the Queen has welcomed another head of state to these shores in her reign. And for now, despite the protests and growing online petition, Downing Street is continuing to stand firm, insisting that the invitation to the president stands.So state visits are not merely ceremonial affairs, they are political and purposeful. They are used by the British government of the day to further what they see as Britain's national interests. In 1973, the Queen welcomed President Mobutu of what was then called Zaire in Africa, now the Democratic Republic of Congo. He was a brutal, corrupt dictator but he was also seen as a vital anti-communist ally in the Cold War against the Soviet Union. So he got an invite to the Palace. President Suharto of Indonesia, another repressive leader who happened to be anti-communist, was also granted a state visit in 1979 for the same reasons.In 1971, Emperor Hirohito of Japan was welcomed by the Queen for a state visit as a deliberate attempt to help usher the country back into the family of nations after its post-war isolation. Not surprisingly, the invitation of the man who had led Japan during World War Two was hugely controversial, and many former army veterans and prisoners of war turned their backs on the royal procession in silent protest. Some wore red gloves to symbolise the blood they saw as being on his hands while others whistled ribald old army tunes. A tree the Emperor had planted was uprooted.In 1978, Nicolae Ceausescu, the notorious Romanian communist leader, and his wife Elena were given a state visit in the vain hope that they might be encouraged to introduce some pro-Western reforms. The Queen was so repulsed by them that, according to the royal author Robert Hardman, while out walking her dogs, she hid behind a bush in the Palace gardens to avoid bumping into the couple who were also out strolling. More than a decade later both Ceausescu and his wife were executed by a revolutionary firing squad.And even the most uncontroversial of state visits, that of President Mandela in 1996, was not without political purpose. There was a feeling in the Foreign Office that South Africa was beginning to slip away from the West towards the unaligned nations, and they wanted to hug Madiba close and remind his country of Britain's anti-apartheid credentials.More recently, in 2014, the state visit of the Irish president to Britain was used as another step of reconciliation. Martin McGuiness, the former Northern Ireland deputy first minister and former IRA leader, not only put on white tie and tails for a state banquet at Windsor Castle, but he also stood for a toast to the Queen. And the state visit of President Xi in 2015 was a deliberate attempt by George Osborne, the then Chancellor, to curry favour with the Chinese and boost British trade links.As for American presidents, only two have been granted full state visits during the current Queen's reign: President Bush in 2003 and President Obama in 2011.What is unusual is the speed with which Mr Trump has been issued with an invitation for a state visit, just days into his presidency. Both Messrs Bush and Obama had to wait until well into their terms of office before they got the call. The haste reflects the importance the prime minister places on securing a good relationship with the new president and winning a post-Brexit trade deal, even if there is some political cost. Mr Bush's visit was by no means uncontroversial, coming so soon after the beginning of the Iraq war. There were demonstrations throughout the trip, including one involving tens of thousands in central London when an effigy of the president was toppled over in a parody of events in Baghdad. So the Queen may be above politics but state visits are not. They are used for diplomacy and are often controversial. And whatever protests may surround any Trump state visit, the Queen will have seen it all before. Rarely has she shown herself unable to cope with whomsoever the government brings round for tea. As one royal insider told me dryly: ""She does have some experience in these matters.""Or as former foreign secretary William Hague wrote more bluntly in the Telegraph this morning, ""A Queen who has been asked over the decades to host tyrants such as Presidents Mobutu of Zaire and Ceausescu of Romania is going to take a brash billionaire from New York effortlessly in her stride.""

The veteran Gaullist already has form.When he was Commissioner for the Internal Market and Financial Services, Mr Barnier was dubbed ""the most dangerous man in Europe"" after taking on the banking sector and championing a cap on bankers' bonuses. But while he alarmed some in the City, and will probably do so again, he also won grudging respect as a tough but even-handed negotiator.He will need all those skills and more in his new role - chief Brexit negotiator at the European Commission. And having moved seamlessly between big jobs in Paris and Brussels - French foreign minister, Commissioner, MEP - he looks well prepared. ""Don't ask me to tell you what will be at the end of the road, we haven't begun to walk yet,"" he told a conference in Brussels last month. Mr Barnier will stick closely to the official EU position of ""no negotiation without notification"" - waiting for the UK to trigger Article 50 to start the formal process of withdrawal. But he's clearly eager to get going.""I am waiting to begin,"" he said. ""I will be ready tomorrow to negotiate, frankly speaking.""And he will bring with him an instinctive pro-European agenda, and a deep knowledge of the workings of the single market.His deputy as chief Brexit negotiator is a German trade expert, Sabine Weyand, adding to the impression that Mr Barnier will lead a team that means business.One of the biggest challenges he (and his boss Jean-Claude Juncker) faces, is to ensure that representatives of the big member states don't sideline him in the Brexit divorce negotiations.But Mr Barnier's long career in French politics means he could well have the ear of the Elysee Palace, especially if - as looks likely - a centre-right candidate wins the French presidency next year. The stakes are so high that there are bound to be some clashes.Mr Barnier has sparred with the UK's Minister for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, before, when the men both served as Europe ministers in the 1990s. It is another reminder that Michel Barnier is a politician first and foremost, rather than a bureaucrat. There have certainly been criticisms - a dash of vanity, a lack of attention to detail. His career has had plenty of downs as well as ups.But he will defend his European vision to the end, and the British government would do well not to underestimate him.At the height of the eurozone crisis, Mr Barnier always refused (politely) to do broadcast interviews in English.""One wrong word,"" he told me once with a smile, ""and we could move markets.""The next few years will be equally challenging."

Scotland voted 62% in favour of Remain.The conversation online was being driven overwhelmingly by pro-independence campaigners. But people who had supported ""Better Together"" during the Scottish referendum vote also spoke about the possibility of a break-away from the UK as a result of the vote over EU membership.  Perhaps the most significant was Scottish author JK Rowling who tweeted: ""Scotland will seek independence now. Cameron's legacy will be breaking up two unions. Neither needed to happen.""Many took to Twitter to express new or strengthened pro-independence feelings in the wake of the latest vote (Just as a reminder: a ""Yes"" vote in Scotland's 2014 referendum was for independence, while the winning ""No"" campaign backed staying in the UK).One old tweet from 2014's independence referendum gained new life on Friday.

2017-02-07,Government avoids Brexit rebellion,https://web.archive.org//web/20170207223710/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38895007,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe government has seen off an attempt to add conditions to its Brexit bill as a Conservative rebellion was avoided.MPs rejected a bid by Labour's Chris Leslie to force the government to consult Parliament on the deal struck with the EU before it is finalised.It came after ministers pledged that a ""meaningful"" vote would be offered.Labour and some Tories had pushed for MPs to have a decisive say on the final terms, but the 326 to 293 vote meant the bill remained unchanged.Seven Conservatives rebelled, while six Labour MPs voted with the government.Several other attempts to amend the draft legislation, which if passed will authorise the prime minister to formally begin Brexit negotiations under Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, were also rejected during more than seven hours of debate.More amendments will be considered on Wednesday before MPs hold a final vote on whether to back the bill.Theresa May has already promised Parliament will get a say on the final deal, but critics, including some Conservatives, said they wanted more than the ""take it or leave it"" vote being offered.Any possibility of a major Conservative rebellion appeared to be halted by comments from Brexit Minister David Jones.Mr Jones said MPs would get a say on the final draft Brexit agreement before it was voted upon by the European Parliament.""This will be a meaningful vote,"" he told MPs. ""It will be the choice of leaving the EU with a negotiated deal or not.""However, some MPs questioned whether any concessions had in fact been offered, with Downing Street playing down claims the government's position had changed.Asked what would happen if Parliament rejected the Brexit deal or if there was no agreement with the EU to vote upon, Mr Jones said that in each scenario the UK would still leave the EU but ""fall back on other arrangements"".This would effectively see the UK default to World Trade Organization trade rules, involving potential tariffs on exports and imports.Opponents of Brexit have said this would cause real damage to British business, but supporters say the UK can live with the consequences if necessary as the UK would then be free to negotiate its own trade arrangements. Mr Jones said the government wanted to avoid a situation in which ministers were  sent back to the negotiating table to hammer out a better deal.This, he said, would be hard given the two-year limit for talks and would also be ""the surest way of undermining our negotiating position and delivering a worse deal"".Former chancellor Ken Clarke - the only Tory to vote against kickstarting the Brexit process last week - said Parliament should have the opportunity to shape the final deal, while former SNP leader Alex Salmond said MPs should have a genuine choice without the ""Sword of Damocles"" hanging over them.Labour's Chuka Umunna said the choice facing MPs was ""unacceptable"", ex-Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg described it as a ""symbolic handout"" while Green Party leader Caroline Lucas said MPs were being ""duped"".But Labour's font bench claimed the move as a ""significant victory"" in response to its repeated demands for a ""meaningful"" vote at the end of the two-year negotiation process.The party withdrew its proposed amendment before Mr Leslie's was defeated.Conservatives Mr Clarke, Bob Neill, Andrew Tyrie, Claire Perry, Anna Soubry, Antoinette Sandbach and Heidi Allen, defied their party whip.Ms Perry told MPs the tone of the debate ""sometimes borders on the hysterical"", before adding: ""I feel like sometimes I am sitting along with colleagues who are like jihadis in their support for a hard Brexit.""Teasing her colleagues, she said: ""No Brexit is hard enough - 'begone you evil Europeans, we never want you to darken our doors again'. People say: 'Steady on, Claire', but I am afraid I heard speeches last week exactly making that point.""On the Labour benches, Frank Field, Ronnie Campbell, Kate Hoey, Kelvin Hopkins, Graham Stringer and Gisela Stuart voted with the government.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who backed the Remain side in last year's EU referendum, has ordered his MPs to support the government's bill, whether his party's amendments are accepted or not, in the third reading vote expected on Wednesday.Mr Corbyn argues that it would be undemocratic to ignore the will of the people, as expressed in last June's EU referendum.Shadow business secretary Clive Lewis has vowed to oppose the bill unless Labour amendments are passed in the Commons.Frontbench members of parties are generally expected to resign from their post if they ignore a three-line whip."

He said it was ""not an automatic right"", but an ""earned honour"", to applause from Labour and SNP MPs.Questioned in the Commons on Tuesday about his remarks, he replied: ""The House has always understood that the chair has a role in these matters.""He added: ""I was honestly and honourably seeking to discharge my responsibilities to the House.""Mr Bercow said it was time ""to move on to other matters"".Conservative MP Sir Gerald Howarth said there had been a ""rather subdued aspect"" among his party's MPs when Mr Bercow had spoken.He added: ""I do hope that you will help us to ensure that we can have full confidence in your impartiality, because that's the way for the House to proceed.""The ""relationship between the United Kingdom and United States is an extremely important one"", Sir Gerald also said.However, Labour MP Paul Flynn said the Commons owed Mr Bercow ""a debt of gratitude for deciding that in this case such an invitation should not be supported by this House."" And SNP MP Alex Salmond, who had several run-ins with Mr Trump when he was Scottish First Minister, told Mr Bercow: ""If ever a statement deserved clapping, then yours did yesterday.""Mr Bercow is one of three ""key holders"" to Westminster Hall - where Mr Trump's predecessor Barack Obama spoke in 2011 - along with the Speaker of the House of Lords, Lord Fowler, and the Lord Great Chamberlain, a hereditary peer in charge of certain parts of the Palace of Westminster. All three must agree in order for an address to take place there. Lord Fowler addressed peers on Tuesday, saying Mr Bercow had not informed him ahead of voicing his opinion on Mr Trump, adding that Mr Bercow had told him he was ""genuinely sorry"" for this.He added: ""I don't intend to argue the case for or against Mr Trump's visit. That's not my role as Speaker.""But let me say I have spent the last 30 years campaigning against discrimination, particularly against LGBT people and people with HIV/Aids.""As speaker, Mr Bercow is the highest authority of the House of Commons and  must remain politically impartial.Several senior Conservatives have been highly critical of his comments.One unnamed Tory MP and former cabinet member told the BBC he ""must be close to standing down"" as Speaker, while another said his remarks had gone ""way beyond what is acceptable"".Conservative MP Nadine Dorries said: ""When he loses support for what was a very partisan moment I think his position will become more and more in jeopardy.""Crispin Blunt, the Conservative MP who chairs the Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee, said Mr Bercow was going to have to deal with ""the consequences"" of his comments.  He added that the Speaker, ""who's meant to referee all of this, should keep himself above that"".What is a state visit?Former Culture Secretary John Whittingdale told Sky News: ""It was a performance, it was John Bercow playing to the gallery and I think it was damaging to the national interest. I think it is regrettable that he did it.""Fellow Conservative Nadhim Zahawi, who has been critical of Mr Trump's travel ban on nationals from seven mainly Muslim countries, said the Speaker prided himself on his neutrality and to become the story was ""a bad place to be"".He said Mr Bercow had opened himself up to accusations of hypocrisy after allowing other controversial leaders, like the Chinese president, to speak, and urged him to explain his thinking to MPs.Meanwhile, Joe Wilson, a Congressman for Mr Trump's republican Party, told the BBC's Newsnight programme Mr Bercow's interjection had been ""very disappointing"".""If ever in recent years there's been a more pro-British president of the United States, it's Donald Trump,"" he said.Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage said Mr Bercow had ""abused his position"" and that to have expressed his opinions in the way he did ""devalues this great office"".But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has called for the state visit to be postponed, welcomed the intervention, while Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said Mr Trump was ""not welcome"".A petition to withdraw the invitation to the US president - and another one backing the visit - will be debated by MPs later this month.No date for Mr Trump's visit has been announced.

Mr Javid set out the details of the housing White Paper in a statement to MPs, with measures including:So-called starter homes, championed by former Prime Minister David Cameron, will be aimed at ""households that need them most"", those with combined incomes of less than £80,000, or £90,000 in London.Starter homes are new homes built for first-time buyers between 23 and 40 years old and sold at least 20% below market value. The maximum price after the discount has been applied is £250,000 outside London and £450,000 in the capital.Under the new proposals, starter home buyers will need a mortgage, ""to stop cash buyers"", and some or all of the discount will have to be repaid if the property is resold within 15 years, ""to reduce the risk of speculation"".A proposal that 20% of all larger developments had to be starter homes is to be dropped and replaced with a ""clear expectation"" that at least 10% of developments will be ""affordable home ownership units"".The 22-year-olds who bought their own home (without mum and dad's help)Ruby Willard, a recruitment consultant, and engineer Sam Bardell bought a £182,200 two-bedroom terraced house in Havant, Hampshire, last year.They took advantage of the government's Help to Buy Isa, but to save for the £18,000 deposit, it was a case of being ""quite tight"", she says.""When we decided we were going to buy, I thought I'm not going to spend money elsewhere when I don't need to...""I get commission and Sam gets overtime so we probably earn £55,000 overall, which meant we were in a position we could borrow maybe more than people on minimum wage.""Read how other 20-somethings managed to do itMr Javid said: ""Walk down your local high street today and there's one sight you're almost certain to see: young people, faces pressed against the estate agent's window, trying and failing to find a home they can afford.""With prices continuing to skyrocket, if we don't act now, a whole generation could be left behind.  We need to do better, and that means tackling the failures at every point in the system. ""The housing market in this country is broken and the solution means building many more houses in the places that people want to live.""Mr Javid admitted there was ""no one single magic bullet"" and there had to be a ""proper conversation about housing need"".Ministers have admitted the government is behind schedule in its efforts to build one million new homes in England by 2020.For Labour, shadow housing minister John Healey said: ""We hoped for better and we needed better. His disappointment will desperately disappoint millions of people struggling to cope with a housing crisis. It was feeble beyond belief.""He added: ""We were promised a White Paper; we are presented with a white flag.""The Lib Dems criticised the ""utterly vacuous"" proposals for not mentioning the government's stated aim of a million new homes by 2020, a target ministers have insisted they are still aiming for.BBC home editor Mark EastonThis government seems to speak with two voices on housing: the communities department wants to shift the balance of power firmly towards new development in places people want to live, but Number 10 and some influential Tory backbenchers are sympathetic to the passionate concerns of those who wish to protect the countryside and particularly the green belt.The real question that lies behind all the rhetoric and policy bullet-points is whether the balance of power between development and local opposition has fundamentally changed.Ministers now accept England needs 250,000 new homes every year, they have described the housing market as ""broken"" and they agree that radical change is the only way to mend it.But many have yet to be convinced that this White Paper amounts to a ""realistic plan"" to achieve that.Read more from MarkFormer Conservative housing minister Grant Shapps told the BBC's Daily Politics the problem would not be solved simply ""by slotting in a few more homes in converted former industrial sites"".He added: ""Housing ministers over the years have come out with documents or bills, and the truth is none of them are going to make much difference - and I don't suppose this will make that much difference either.""The reason is this - unless you build literally two, three, million more homes then you're not going to solve the problem.""The Local Government Association said the White Paper contained ""some encouraging signs"" on increasing housing supply and affordability.It welcomed the new ""flexibility"" around starter homes and called for new power and funding to allow councils to build affordable homes directly.The Campaign to Protect Rural England welcomed what it said was a focus on addressing current failings rather than ""meddling"" with the planning system.""We are pleased that ministers have recognised that weakening the Green Belt is unnecessary,"" said chief executive Shaun Spiers. ""But with 360,000 houses already proposed for Green Belt land the government needs to do much more to uphold national policy and stop councils releasing it for development.""Daniel Bentley, editorial director at the think tank Civitas, said: ""The problem is not sites with planning permission standing idle, except in limited circumstances.""It is with sites that are being developed, but too slowly to get ahead of demand and make any difference to the affordability of housing.""Graeme Brown, interim chief executive of the homelessness charity Shelter, said: ""The White Paper poses the right questions. What we need now is quick and bold action that helps people in need of a decent home tomorrow, not in 10 years.""

2017-02-07,Tax burden 'to be highest in 30 years',https://web.archive.org//web/20170207223710/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-38894023,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkTax is set to rise as a share of the UK's income to its highest level since 1986, according to a think tank.Higher income from taxes and relatively low growth will combine to create this effect, according to the the Institute for Fiscal Studies.Austerity will continue into the 2020s, after Chancellor Philip Hammond's decision to scrap a target of balancing the nation's books, it said.The Treasury said it was committed to repairing Britain's finances.Forecasts by Oxford Economics, which contributed to the report, estimate the UK economy will grow by 1.6% in 2017.In 2018, growth in gross domestic product will slow to 1.3%, Oxford Economics said. Growth is expected to be dulled as a result of inflation prompted by the decline of the value of the pound after the EU referendum.While a weaker pound is likely to improve the performance of manufacturers and exporters, higher costs for consumers will more than erase this gain, said the report.Ahmed: Public finances and the shadow of Osborne""Though the UK economy has continued to achieve solid growth, it has been almost entirely reliant on the consumer,"" said Andrew Goodwin, lead UK Economist at Oxford Economics and co-author of part of the report.""With spending power set to come under significant pressure from higher inflation and the welfare squeeze, the consumer will not be able to keep contributing more than its fair share. Exports should be a bright spot, but overall a slowdown in GDP growth appears likely.""The UK's economy could be 3% smaller by 2030 than if Britain had voted Remain, according to forecasts in the IFS's annual Green Budget.This annual analysis, ahead of next month's Budget, says spending on health, social care and benefits for sick or disabled people represents a particular risk to the public finances because it accounts for almost one third of government expenditure. The report confirms that the period between 2009 and 2014 saw the slowest rate of growth in health spending in England since the mid-1950s.And it argues that health budgets by the end of this decade will be over a billion pounds less than what is needed to cope with England's growing and ageing population, regardless of what are likely to be significant rises in demand for NHS care.  In a statement, the Treasury said: ""The government is committed to repairing the public finances and living within our means so that we can build an economy that works for all.""That has required some difficult decisions on spending, but we are determined to deliver efficient public services which provide maximum value for every pound of taxpayers' money.""Spending on public services dropped by 10% since 2010, the report said, after adjusting the figures for inflation.To meet his target of eliminating the deficit during the next parliament, which is from 2020 to 2025, Mr Hammond will probably have to find a further £34bn in tax rises and spending cuts, extending austerity.The report said £17bn of tax rises could be needed to contribute to closing the gap for government between outgoings and income.

However, a highly critical report said it faces challenges in meeting the aims.Few details of where the money will go have been publicly released and there has been limited scrutiny of the scheme, it said.Outline bids for money - known as concept notes - contained ""limited detail"" as to how objectives will be achieved, the report added.""Given the speed at which participating departments are expected to move from concept notes through to full business cases and implementation at scale, the lack of delivery capacity in key departments and diplomatic posts presents some serious risks,"" it said.By James Landale, BBC diplomatic correspondentThe Prosperity Fund was set up two years ago to help departments like the Foreign Office provide British aid in a new way. Its aim was not just to reduce poverty but also help build markets for British firms overseas. So it was given a budget of £1.3bn to spend over five years in countries like India, China and Brazil. But the Independent Commission for Aid Impact, which monitors aid spending, says the fund's work is ""fragmented"", it lacks transparency, there are ""conflict of interest concerns"" and ""significant risks"" about value for money and delivery. It also questions whether the fund breaks rules about what is and what is not overseas development assistance. As such, the watchdog says the government must hold back some of the spending to make sure it is being used wisely.Alison Evans, ICAI's chief commissioner, said the Prosperity Fund was ""a complex and ambitious initiative"", adding that it has made ""significant progress"" in a short space of timeHowever, she said: ""To deliver on its aims it must continue to improve its systems and processes, particularly given the risks associated with its current speed of delivery.""We therefore recommend the government reviews the current spending plans to ensure the amount of UK aid spent matches the Prosperity Fund's capacity to deliver the results for people in developing countries, and for business.""A government spokesman said it was already implementing the vast majority of ICAI's early recommendations, including on transparency""Sustained economic growth is the only long term solution to poverty and the Prosperity Fund supports the vital economic development needed to help middle-income countries, where more than 60% of the world's poorest live, to stand on their own two feet and become our trading partners of the future."""
2017-02-07,Holyrood votes against triggering Brexit,https://web.archive.org//web/20170207223710/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-38880999,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe Scottish Parliament has voted by 90 to 34 to oppose the UK government starting the Brexit process.The Supreme Court ruled last month that there was no legal need for Holyrood to give its consent to the triggering of Article 50.But First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she would let MSPs have a say, despite it being largely symbolic. Ms Sturgeon predicted the vote would be one of the most significant in the Scottish Parliament since devolution. The SNP tried to block the UK government's Brexit bill last week.Only one of Scotland's 59 MPs - Scottish Secretary David Mundell - supported the bill, but it ultimately passed its first parliamentary hurdle by 498 votes to 114.The European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill returned to the Commons on Monday, when MPs began detailed scrutiny of the legislation.MSPs voted to back a Scottish government motion in the Scottish Parliament stating that the bill should not proceed.The SNP, Greens, Liberal Democrats and most Labour MSPs supported the motion, with three Labour MSPs - Neil Findlay, Elaine Smith and Richard Leonard - defying the party whip and opposing it alongside the Conservatives. The motion, lodged by Brexit minister Michael Russell, said the UK government had failed to properly consult the devolved administrations on an agreed UK position on Brexit. It also said the government had refused to give a guarantee on the position of EU nationals in the UK, and had failed to answer a range of questions regarding the full implications of withdrawal from the single market.A Green amendment, stating that the decision to proceed with the Brexit bill does not respect the majority vote to remain part of the EU that was returned in every council area in Scotland, was backed by 72 votes to 33 with 18 abstentions.Mr Russell opened what was to become a heated debate by saying Scotland had voted ""clearly and decisively"" to remain in the EU in last year's referendum.He said the Holyrood vote would allow MSPs to ""say to the UK, to Europe and to the world that we oppose the catastrophic hard Brexit now being pursued by the Tories at Westminster.""Mr Russell added: ""This vote is more than symbolic. It is a key test of whether Scotland's voice is being listened to, and whether our wishes can be accommodated within the UK process.""He insisted that the Scottish government had worked ""long and hard"" to deliver compromise proposals, which he said would have allowed Scotland to stay in the single market even in the rest of the UK leaves. But he said: ""So far, the UK government has not offered a single compromise of its own. In fact, it has offered nothing. Neither formal reaction to our proposals, nor formal rejection of them.""Mr Russell went on to describe the Holyrood debate as being ""about democracy itself"", adding: ""It's a debate about the sort of country the UK is becoming and the sort of country we in Scotland wish to be. And the contrast between those countries is stark.""John Lamont of the Scottish Conservatives claimed the Scottish government's default position was to ""try to manufacture a grievance out of nothing"".He said: ""The Scottish government try to portray the Supreme Court ruling and the UK government's bill to trigger Article 50 as an example of Scotland being ignored.""The truth is actually more simple. It is a matter for Scotland's other parliament to deal with and it is, as a reserved matter, one for Scotland's MPs to scrutinise.""He added: ""This is how the devolution settlement works, and it is time that the SNP accepted this principle and moved on from grievance politics.""Despite the rhetoric from the Scottish government, the reality is that they are being given plenty of opportunity to engage in the process of the UK leaving the EU.""Scottish Labour said it would vote against triggering Article 50 - although three of its MSPs defied that instruction - but tabled an amendment calling on the SNP not to use Brexit as an excuse for a second independence referendum. The move put Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale at odds with UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who is facing a revolt by pro-Remain MPs - including the party's only Scottish MP Ian Murray - who are defying his leadership to vote against the Brexit bill at Westminster.Ms Dugdale told the Holyrood debate that Brexit and independence were ""two sides of the same coin"", adding: ""The only thing worse than Brexit for Scottish jobs and the economy would be independence.""Our nation is divided enough. Another referendum would do irreparable damage to the very fabric of communities across Scotland.""But the reality is that the SNP has only been given the excuse to seek another referendum because of the mess the Conservatives have made of this whole process"".The Scottish Greens staged a ""Scotland says stay"" rally outside Holyrood to mark the debate.The party's MSP Ross Greer said the Article 50 bill was ""wildly inadequate"" and claimed the Scottish government's attempts at compromise had been met by little but ""empty rhetoric"" from the UK government, Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie went on the attack by saying the SNP was obsessed with independence, while the Tories were dividing the country with Brexit and Labour was in ""total and utter confusion"".A UK government spokesman said Holyrood was free to debate any issue it chooses, and that it would ""continue our engagement with the Scottish government and with people and groups across Scotland as we prepare to leave the EU to secure the best deal for Scotland and the UK."" Speaking in the Commons on Monday, Prime Minister Theresa May warned MPs not to ""obstruct"" the will of UK voters by changing the Brexit bill.She said: ""The message is clear to all - this House has spoken and now is not the time to obstruct the democratically expressed wishes of the British people.""It is time to get on with leaving the European Union and building an independent, self-governing, global Britain."""

As well as stealing food, seagulls have also been blamed for killing a dog and a tortoise.Mr Colvile, MP for Plymouth Sutton and Devonport, said: ""We've got to make sure that when we build new buildings that we make it possible for seagulls to be discouraged from putting their nests in and all of that.""More on calls for seagull-proof buildings, and other newsBut speaking ahead of the debate, Peter Rock, a researcher at the University of Bristol who has been studying the protected birds for more than 30 years, said new buildings were ""only a tiny scrap"" of options for seagulls to nest in.Colonies of urban seagulls had more than doubled since 2000 and ""pest control systems really don't work"", he said.Steve Double, the St Austell and Newquay Conservative MP, also spoke at the debate and said a cull of seagulls may be needed to protect coastal communities from attacks.He also spoke about taking eggs from the seagulls, and said a national study of the birds was needed."

It just means that you cannot use other people's resources.""Prof Phillips added: ""Wylfa Newydd will go on, of course, and we will have to depend on people from the outside to be trained, and make plans to do so. ""The investment will be bigger and, of course, the expense will be bigger as the pound has fallen in value. It does not bode well.""Wylfa Newydd developers Horizon Nuclear Power said that although withdrawal from Euratom could cause ""problems"", these would not impair the company's ability to source and train staff.A spokesman said: ""Whilst the UK's withdrawal from Euratom would present issues that would need to be addressed we are confident these can be resolved on a timescale that keeps us on schedule to successfully deliver our lead project, Wylfa Newydd. ""The government has indicated that it is determined to ensure there are no negative impacts from withdrawal and we welcome this commitment.""In response, the UK government said: ""Leaving Euratom is a result of the decision to leave the EU as they are uniquely legally joined. ""The UK supports Euratom and will want to see continuity of co-operation and standards. ""We remain absolutely committed to the highest standards of nuclear safety, safeguards and support for the industry. ""Our aim is clear; we want to maintain our mutually successful civil nuclear co-operation with the EU.""A Welsh Government spokesperson said: ""We note the UK government has been assessing the implications of exiting Euratom. ""We will seek further detail on this matter along with assurance the withdrawal will have no negative effects on the nuclear sector in Wales and the UK."""

But Mrs May said she and EU leaders wanted to ""get on"" with Brexit talks.MPs have already backed the principle of the bill, which would give Mrs May the power to trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, starting formal negotiations on Brexit.Labour has suggested it will not ""frustrate Brexit"" even if it fails to amend the bill in its committee stage this week, during which it will undergo more detailed scrutiny.The government wants to notify the EU of its intention to leave, giving effect to last June's referendum vote and starting two years of talks, by the end of March.For this to happen, MPs and peers must pass a bill giving their approval - a process expected to take about a month. In a statement on the weekend's EU summit in Malta, Mrs May told MPs: ""Our European partners now want to get on with the negotiations. So do I, and so does this House, which last week voted by a majority of 384 in support of the government triggering Article 50.""There are of course further stages for the Bill in committee and in the Lords and it is right that this process should be completed properly.""She added: ""But the message is clear to all - this House has spoken and now is not the time to obstruct the democratically expressed wishes of the British people.""It is time to get on with leaving the European Union and building an independent, self-governing, global Britain.""The legislation comes back to the Commons on Monday for three days of debate culminating in a vote on its third reading.Among the amendments likely to be debated on Tuesday is one tabled by former Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman calling for a guarantee that all nationals of other EU countries lawfully resident in the UK at the time of last year's referendum should have the right to remain after Brexit.Mrs May has said she wants an early agreement on their status but is resisting calls from many MPs to offer a unilateral guarantee - saying she wants reciprocal guarantees from other EU countries about UK citizens living on the continent.Ms Harman's amendment has the backing of the Lib Dems, SNP and the one Green MP - although it would need the support of a number of Conservatives for it to pass.Labour is also seeking a ""meaningful vote"" in Parliament on the final deal struck between the UK and the EU before it is voted on by the European Parliament. The BBC understands some Conservative MPs have held discussions with Labour MPs about forcing the PM to concede a vote if there is no agreement on the UK's future trade relations with the EU.Downing Street has insisted that it is ""not contemplating"" a scenario in which there is no deal with the EU and the bill does not need to be amended.Ministers have said they believe the UK will be able to agree the terms of its separation and the outline of a trade deal within the two-year timeframe and even if there is no trade agreement, the UK will leave the EU anyway.There continue to be divisions in Labour ranks over whether to accept Brexit or not. Ten shadow ministers were among 47 Labour MPs who rejected party orders to back the bill at second reading last week while shadow home secretary Diane Abbott missed the crucial vote, citing illness.Shadow business secretary Clive Lewis has said he will vote against the bill at third reading on Wednesday unless Labour's amendments are accepted, describing them as ""red lines"".Labour's shadow cabinet will discuss the party's approach on Tuesday but Mr Corbyn suggested on Sunday that Ms Abbott and others would be expected to follow the party line if a three-line whip is imposed for Wednesday's vote. Also speaking on Sunday, shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said there were ""private conversations"" taking place between the parties on trying to find ""a compromise that will work"". She denied it was ""illogical"" to demand amendments but still back the bill in the final vote if they are rejected."
2017-02-07,Voting data sheds light on referendum,https://web.archive.org//web/20170207223710/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38762034,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe BBC has obtained a more localised breakdown of votes from nearly half of the local authorities which counted EU referendum ballots last June.This information provides much greater depth and detail in explaining the pattern of how the UK voted. The key findings are:A statistical analysis of the data obtained for over a thousand individual local government wards confirms how the strength of the local Leave vote was strongly associated with lower educational qualifications.Wards where the population had fewer qualifications tended to have a higher Leave vote, as shown in the chart. If the proportion of the local electorate with a degree or similar qualification was one percentage point lower, then on average the leave vote was higher by nearly one percentage point.Using ward-level data means we can compare voting figures in this way to the local demographic information collected in the 2011 census. Of the main census statistics, this is the one with the greatest association with how people voted. In statistical terms the level of educational qualifications explains about two-thirds of the variation in the results between different wards. The correlation is strong, whether based on assessing graduate and equivalent qualifications or lower-level ones. This ward-by-ward analysis covers 1,070 individual wards in England and Wales whose boundaries had not changed since the 2011 census, about one in nine of the UK's wards. We had very little ward-level data from Scotland, and none from Northern Ireland.It should be noted, however, that many ward counts also included some postal votes from across the counting area, and therefore some variation between wards will have been masked by the random allocation of postal votes for counting. This makes the results less accurate geographically, but we can still use the information to explore broad national and local patterns.  Adding age as a second factor significantly helps to further explain voting patterns. Older populations were more likely to vote Leave. Education and age combined account for nearly 80% of the voting variation between wards. Ethnicity is a smaller factor, but one which also contributed to the results. Adding that in means that now 83% of the variation in the vote between wards is explained. White populations were generally more pro-Leave, and ethnic minorities less so.  However, there were some interesting differences between London and elsewhere.The ethnic dimension is particularly interesting when examining the outliers on the graph that compares the Leave vote to levels of education.There are numerous wards towards the bottom left of the graph where electorates with lower educational qualifications nevertheless produced low Leave and high Remain votes. This is where the link between low qualifications and Leave voting breaks down. It turns out that these exceptional wards have high ethnic minority populations, particularly in Birmingham and Haringey in north London. In contrast, there are virtually no dramatic outliers on the other side of the line, where comparatively highly educated populations voted Leave. Only one point on the graph stands out - this is Osterley and Spring Grove in Hounslow, west London, a mainly ethnic minority ward which had a Leave vote of 63%. While this figure does include some postal votes, they are not nearly enough to explain away this unusual outcome.In fact, in Ealing and Hounslow, west London boroughs with many voters of Asian origin, the ethnic correlation was in the other direction to the national picture: a higher number of Asian voters was associated with a higher Leave vote.This powerful link to educational attainment could stem from the lower qualified tending to feel less confident about their prospects and ability to compete for work in a competitive globalised economy with high levels of migration. On the other hand some commentators see it as primarily reflecting a ""culture war"" or ""values conflict"", rather than issues of economics and inequality. Research shows that non-graduates tend to take less liberal positions than graduates on a range of social issues from immigration and multi-culturalism to the death penalty.   The former campaign director of Vote Leave, Dominic Cummings, argues that the better educated are more prone to holding irrational political opinions because they are more driven by fashion and a group mentality. Of course this assessment does not imply that Leave voters were almost all poorly educated and old, and Remain voters well educated and young. The Leave side obviously attracted support from many middle class professionals, graduates and younger people. Otherwise it couldn't have won. While there was undoubtedly a lot of voting which cut across these criteria, the point of this analysis is to explore how different social groups most probably voted - and it is clear that education, age and ethnicity were crucial influences.  After these three key factors are taken into account, adding in further demographic measures from the census does little to increase the explanation of UK-wide voting patterns. However, this does not reflect the distinctively more pro-Remain voting in Scotland, since we are short of Scottish data at this geographical level. It is clear as well that in a few specific locations high student numbers were also very relevant. To a certain extent, using the level of educational qualifications as a measure combines both class and age factors, with working class and older adults both tending to be less well qualified.But the association between education and the voting results is stronger than the association between social or occupational class and the results. This is still true after taking the age of the local population into account.This suggests that voters with lower qualifications were more likely to back Leave than the better qualified, even when they were in the same social or occupational class.The existence of a significant connection between Leave voting and lower educational qualifications had already been suggested by analysis of the published referendum results from the official counting areas.The data we have obtained strengthens this conclusion, because voting patterns can now be compared to social statistics from the 2011 census at a much more detailed geographical level than by the earlier studies. The BBC analysis is also consistent with opinion polling (for example, from Lord Ashcroft, Ipsos Mori and YouGov) that tried to identify the characteristics of Leave and Remain voters.  The data we have collected can be used to illustrate the sort of places where the Leave and Remain camps did particularly well: it is hard to imagine a more glaring social contrast than that between the deprived, poorly educated housing estates of Brambles and Thorntree in Middlesbrough, and the privileged elite colleges of Market ward in central Cambridge. It is important to bear in mind, however, that most of the voting figures mentioned below also include some postal votes, so they should be treated as approximate rather than precise.  It is also important to note that the examples are limited to the places for which we were able to obtain localised information, which was only a minority of areas. The rest of the country may well contain even starker instances.Of the 1,283 individual wards for which we have data, the highest Leave vote was 82.5% in Brambles and Thorntree, a section of east Middlesbrough with many social problems. Ward boundaries have changed since the 2011 census, but in that survey the Thorntree part of the area had the lowest proportion of people with a degree or similar qualification of anywhere in England and Wales, at only 5%. And according to Middlesbrough council, the figure for the current Brambles and Thorntree ward is even lower, at just 4%. Second highest was 80.3% in Waterlees Village, a poor locality within Wisbech, Cambridgeshire. This area has seen a major influx of East European migrants who have been doing low-paid work in nearby food processing factories and farms, with tensions between them and British residents. Other wards with available data which had the strongest Leave votes were congregated in Middlesbrough, Canvey Island in Essex, Skegness in coastal Lincolnshire, and Havering in east London.The highest Remain vote was 87.8% in Market ward in central Cambridge, an area with numerous colleges and a high student population, in a city which was strongly pro-Remain.This was followed by Ashley ward  (85.6%) in central Bristol, a district featuring ethnic diversity, gentrification and alternative culture.Next highest was Northumberland Park (85.0%) in Haringey, north London, which has a substantial black population. Other wards with available data which had the strongest Remain votes were generally located in Cambridge, Bristol and the multi-ethnic London boroughs of Haringey and Lambeth. The count for Ashburton in Croydon, south London, split 50-50 exactly, with both Leave and Remain getting 3,885 votes, but that did include some postal ballots.As for being nearest to the overall result, the combined count of Tulketh and University, neighbouring wards near the centre of Preston, was 51.92% for leave, very close to the UK wide figure of 51.89%. The individual ward of Barnwood in Gloucester had Leave at 51.94%. Both figures however contain some postal votes.Given that a few councils provided even more detailed data down to the level of polling districts, it is possible to identify some very small localities that were nicely representative of the national picture. The 527 voters in the neighbouring districts of Kirk Langley and Mackworth in Amber Valley in Derbyshire, whose two ballot boxes were counted together, produced a leave proportion of 51.99%. And this figure is not contaminated by any postal votes.So journalists (or anyone else for that matter) who seek a microcosm of the UK should perhaps visit the Mundy Arms pub in Mackworth, the location for that district's polling station.Similarly, the 427 voters in the combined neighbouring polling districts of Chiddingstone Hoath and Hever Four Elms to the south of Sevenoaks in Kent delivered a leave vote of 51.6% (again, without any postal votes).The data obtained points to 269 areas of various sizes (wards, clusters of wards or constituencies) which had a different Leave/Remain outcome compared to the official counting area of which they were part.This consists of 150 areas which backed Remain but were part of Leave-voting counting areas; and 119 in the other direction. The detailed information therefore gives us an understanding of how the electorate voted which is more variegated than the officially published results.Every one of Scotland's 32 counting areas came down on the Remain side. Yet, despite the fact that most Scottish councils did not give us much detailed information, we can nevertheless identify a few smaller parts of the country which actually backed Leave.A cluster of six wards in the Banff and Buchan area in north Aberdeenshire had a strong Leave majority of 61%. There is much local discontent within the fishing industry of this coastal district about the EU's common fisheries policy.An Taobh Siar agus Nis, a ward at the northern end of the Isle of Lewis in Na h-Eileanan an Iar (Western Isles), also voted Leave, if very narrowly. And at a smaller geographical level, in Shetland the 567 voters in the combined polling districts of Whalsay and South Unst had an extremely high Leave vote of 81%. The island of Whalsay is a fishing community, where EU rules have been controversial and in 2012 numerous skippers were heavily fined for major breaches of fishing quotas.Ealing and Hounslow are neighbouring multi-ethnic boroughs in the west of London with large Asian populations, where - in contrast to the national picture - non-white ethnicity was associated with voting Leave, particularly in Ealing. Both boroughs shared a varied internal pattern of prosperous largely white areas voting strongly Remain, poorer largely white areas preferring Leave, and the Asian areas tending to be more evenly split.Ealing voted 60% Remain, with Southfield ward hitting 76%, but in contrast the Southall wards which are over 90% ethnic minority were close to 50-50.In Hounslow the richer wards in Chiswick in the east of the area voted heavily Remain (73%), but the poorer largely white wards at the opposite western end in Feltham and Bedfont voted Leave (64-66%). Osterley and Spring Grove was also 63% Leave, the highest Leave vote in any individual ward in the UK with a non-white majority for which we have data. The south London borough of Bromley narrowly voted Remain. Those parts which did not do so by a significant margin were the Cray Valley wards, largely poor white working class areas; and Biggin Hill and Darwin wards, locations to the south which contain more open countryside and lie outside the built-up commuter belt. In Croydon in south London, places which voted Leave by substantial amounts were New Addington and Fieldway, neighbouring wards with large council estates. Beyond the areas with the strongest backing for Leave and Remain, examining the detailed breakdown of votes in various places gives greater insight into the pattern of support for the two sides - as can be seen from the following examples.In several places (for example, Birmingham, Bristol, Nottingham, Portsmouth) there was a strong contrast between the Leave-voting populations of large, rundown, predominantly white, housing estates in the urban periphery, versus Remain-voting populations in inner city areas with large numbers of ethnic minorities and sometimes students.Birmingham had several wards with large Remain votes, although the city as a whole narrowly voted Leave.  These pro-Remain wards tended to be the more highly educated, better off localities, or minority ethnic areas which strongly backed Remain despite low levels of educational qualifications. I have written about this before. In Blackburn with Darwen, Bastwell ward had the highest Remain vote at 65%, compared to only 44% in the area as a whole. This ward has an ethnic minority proportion of over 90%. Other Blackburn wards which voted Remain were also ones with high minority populations.Bradford voted to Leave (54%), but the area included some starkly contrasting places which went over 60% Remain: the prosperous, genteel, spa town of Ilkley, and strongly ethnic minority wards in the city, such as Manningham and Toller.Bristol voted strongly Remain on the whole (62%), but there were some striking exceptions, particularly the large, deprived, mainly white estates to the south of the city. Hartcliffe and Withywood backed Leave at 67%. Similar neighbouring wards (Hengrove and Whitchurch Park, Filwood, Bishopsworth and Stockwood) also voted Leave, as did the more industrial area of Avonmouth and Lawrence Weston to the north west of the city.As a county Cornwall voted to Leave. But one of its six parliamentary constituencies, Truro and Falmouth, voted 53% to Remain, possibly linked to a significant student population.In Lincoln, which voted 57% to Leave, Carholme ward stands out as very different - it voted 63% to Remain. This ward includes Lincoln University, and 43% of the residents are students Middlesbrough voted 65% to Leave. As already noted, it had several wards with extremely high leave votes of over 75%. But one ward, Linthorpe, voted very narrowly to Remain - a comparatively well-to-do inner suburb which includes an art college; and another ward, Central, which contains Teesside University, nearly did. Mole Valley in Surrey exhibited a dramatic contrast between two neighbouring districts with very different demographics and housing. The highest Remain vote was in the very prosperous location of Dorking South, which voted 63% Remain, but the neighbouring ward of Holmwoods, dominated by large estates on the edge of the town of Dorking, voted 57% Leave, the area's highest Leave vote. Nottingham voted narrowly to Leave, but the inner city ward of Radford and Park voted 68% Remain. This has both a comparatively high proportion of ethnic minorities and considerable numbers of students from two nearby universities. There was a lot of variation within the area. Bulwell - a market town to the north of the city with many social problems - voted 69% Leave  There was also a high Leave vote in the housing estate locations of the Clifton wards in the south of Nottingham.Oldham voted to Leave at 61%, but Werneth, the city ward with the highest ethnic minority population, voted Remain (57%). Other wards with high minority populations also voted Remain.In Oxford the cluster of polling districts which included Blackbird Leys and other deprived estates on the southern edge of the city voted to Leave at 51%. In contrast the central areas containing colleges, university buildings and student accommodation voted to Remain at over 80%.Plymouth voted 60% Leave, but Drake ward which includes the university had the city's highest Remain vote at 56%. Portsmouth was another place with wide variation. Paulsgrove ward, with its large estate on the edge of the city, had the highest Leave vote at 70%, whereas at the other end of the spectrum Central Southsea, an inner city ward and student area, voted 57% Remain.Rochdale voted 60% Leave. The place which bucked this trend by voting 59% Remain, Milkstone and Deeplish, was the most predominantly ethnic minority ward. Central Rochdale had the second highest Remain vote and is the other ward that is mainly not white. Walsall voted strongly Leave (68%). The only ward which voted Remain, Paddock, is both a comparatively prosperous and multi-ethnic locality.A few councils released their data at remarkably localised levels, down even to individual polling districts (ie ballot boxes) in the case of Blackburn with Darwen and Bracknell Forest, or clusters of two/three/four districts, in the case of Amber Valley, Brentwood, Sevenoaks, Shetland, South Oxfordshire, and Tewkesbury.This provides very local and specific data, in some cases just for neighbourhoods of hundreds of voters.At its most detailed this reveals that the 110 people who cast their votes in the ballot box at St. Alban's Primary School in central Blackburn split 56-52 in favour of Remain, with two spoilt papers.It also discloses stark contrasts in some neighbouring locations. The 953 people who voted at Little Harwood community centre in north Blackburn had a Leave vote of only 31%, while the 336 electors who voted in the neighbouring ballot box at Roe Lee Park primary school produced a Leave percentage over twice as high, at 64%.The very detailed data we obtained also provides some rare evidence on the views of postal compared to non-postal voters. Campaign strategists have often deliberated on whether the two groups vote differently and should be given separate targeted messages.Most places mixed boxes of postal and non-postal votes for counting, so generally it's not possible to draw comparative conclusions. However there were a few exceptions which recorded them separately, or included a very small number of non-postal votes with the postals.These figures indicate that postal voters were narrowly less likely to back Leave than voters in polling stations. Data covering five counting areas with about 260,000 votes shows that in these places the roughly one in five electors who voted by post backed Leave at 55.4%, one percentage point lower than the local non-postal support for Leave of 56.4%.The counting areas involved are Amber Valley, East Cambridgeshire, Gwynedd, Hyndburn and North Warwickshire.Since the referendum the BBC has been trying to get the most detailed, localised voting data we could from each of the counting areas.  This was a major data collection exercise carried out by my colleague George Greenwood. We managed to obtain voting figures broken down into smaller geographical units for 178 of the 399 referendum counting areas (380 councils in England, Wales and Scotland, with a separate tally in Gibraltar, while in Northern Ireland results were issued for the 18 constituencies). This varied between data for individual local government wards, wards grouped into clusters, and constituency level data. In a few cases the results supplied were even more localised than ward level. Overall the extra data covers a wide range of different areas and kinds of councils across the UK. Electoral returning officers are not covered by the Freedom of Information Act, so releasing the information was up to the discretion of councils. While some were very willing, in other cases it required a lot of persistence and persuasion. Some councils could not supply any detailed data because they mixed all ballot boxes prior to counting; some did possess more local figures but simply refused to disclose them to us. Others did provide data, but the combinations in which ballot boxes were mixed before counting were too complex to fit ward boundaries neatly.A few places such as Birmingham released their ward by ward data following the referendum on their own initiative, but in most cases the information had to be obtained by us requesting it directly, and sometimes repeatedly, from the authority."

But Sir Gerald, MP for Aldershot, raised a point of order, telling the Commons: ""I was surprised by [the] statement, which had the sort of appearance of an executive order.""He added that traditional clerks' dress was ""key to the dignity of the House"" and had been so ""for several centuries"", adding that MPs ""should discuss this"".Mr Bercow replied that it was ""a matter that can properly be decided by the Speaker"", adding that the House of Commons Commission had approved the changes, which clerks themselves had suggested.  He said that, if one went back more than a ""couple of hundred years"", the situation was different from that presented by Sir Gerald, and that ""several centuries ago"", clerks ""did not wear wigs"".Mr Bercow has refrained from wearing a wig himself in the Commons since becoming Speaker in 2009, as did his predecessors Michael Martin and Betty Boothroyd."

2017-02-07,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20170207223710/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThis article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide to the UK's vote to leave the European Union. It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 52% to 48%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%, as did Wales, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who resigned on the day after losing the referendum. Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she says she will respect the will of the people. She has said ""Brexit means Brexit"" but there is still a lot of debate about what that will mean in practice especially on the two key issues of how British firms do business in the European Union and what curbs are brought in on the rights of European Union nationals to live and work in the UK. She set out more details of her negotiating hopes in her key speech on Brexit.The UK economy appears to have weathered the initial shock of the Brexit vote, although the value of the pound remains near a 30-year low, but opinion is sharply divided over the long-term effects of leaving the EU. Some major firms such as Easyjet and John Lewis have pointed out that the slump in sterling has increased their costs. Britain also lost its top AAA credit rating, meaning the cost of government borrowing will be higher. But share prices have recovered from a dramatic slump in value, with both the FTSE 100 and the broader FTSE 250 index, which includes more British-based businesses, trading higher than before the referendum. The Bank of England cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - a record low and the first cut since 2009 - after the vote and there has not been the economic slump or recession that some had predicted. Here is a regularly updated detailed rundown of how Britain's economy is doingThe European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it has to invoke an agreement called Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May has said she intends to trigger this process by the end of March 2017, meaning the UK will be expected to have left by the summer of 2019, depending on the precise timetable agreed during the negotiations. The government will also enact a Great Repeal Bill which will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. It is expected to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove.After a court battle, the UK's Supreme Court has ruled that Parliament must be consulted before Article 50 is invoked. This is why a two line Brexit bill is currently making its way through Parliament. MPs and Lords have to vote on it.The court verdict was not what the government argued for, but ministers have insisted it will not delay their planned timetable.Most MPs are expected to vote in favour of Article 50 being triggered, although there could be attempts to amend the draft legislation.Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These men - dubbed the Three Brexiteers - will play a central role in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although it will be Mrs May, as prime minister, who will have the final say. The government did not do any emergency planning for Brexit ahead of the referendum and Mrs May has rejected calls to say what her negotiating goals are.Once Article 50 has been triggered, the UK will have two years to negotiate its withdrawal. But no one really knows how the Brexit process will work - Article 50 was only created in late 2009 and it has never been used. Former Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, now Chancellor, wanted Britain to remain in the EU, and he has suggested it could take up to six years for the UK to complete exit negotiations. The terms of Britain's exit will have to be agreed by 27 national parliaments, a process which could take some years, he has argued. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. The UK will continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making.Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Following Theresa May's Brexit recent speech we now know that the UK is not intending to stay in the EU's single market. Although there has been speculation for months about the issue, it would have meant the UK staying under the auspices of the European Court of Justice and having to allow unlimited EU immigration, under freedom of movement rules.Both sides want trade to continue after Brexit with the UK seeking a positive outcome for those who wish to trade goods and services"" - such as those in the City of London and wanting a ""comprehensive free trade deal"" giving the UK ""the greatest possible access"" to the single market. Mrs May says she wants the UK to reach a new customs union deal with the EU. A customs union is where countries agree not to impose tariffs on each others' goods and have a common tariff on goods coming in from elsewhere. The UK is currently part of the EU customs union but that stops the UK being able to do its own trade deals with other countries. Reality Check: How could customs union work?These terms have increasingly been used as debate focused on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people in order to maintain access to the EU single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result.The government has declined to give a firm guarantee about the status of EU nationals currently living in the UK, saying this is not possible without a reciprocal pledge from other EU members about the millions of British nationals living on the continent. EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, will be be able to stay, the chief civil servant at the Home Office has said. The rights of other EU nationals would be subject to negotiations on Brexit and the ""will of Parliament"", he added.A lot depends on the kind of deal the UK agrees with the EU. If it remains within the single market, it would almost certainly retain free movement rights, allowing UK citizens to work in the EU and vice versa. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.Again, it depends on whether the UK government decides to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages. Citizens' Advice has reminded people their rights have not changed yet and asked anyone to contact them if they think they have been discriminated against following the Leave vote.Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested EU migrants who come to the UK as Brexit nears may not be given the right to stay. He has said there might have to be a cut-off point if there was a ""surge"" in new arrivals.People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote.The day-to-day spending impact is likely to be more significant. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it to remain at least 10% below where it was on 23 June, in the long term. This means imported goods will consequently get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have already been seen and the issue was most notably illustrated by the dispute between Tesco and Marmite's makers about whether prices would be put up or not in the stores.The latest UK inflation figures, for December, showed the CPI inflation rate jumping to 1.6%, its highest level for two years with signs of more cost pressures set to feed through in the months to come.Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration.She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations. As mentioned above, the key issue is whether other EU nations will grant the UK access to the single market, if that is what it wants, while at the same time being allowed to restrict the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK.Mrs May has said she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. It is currently running at 330,000 a year, of which 184,000 are EU citizens, and 188,000 are from outside the EU - the figures include a 39,000 outflow of UK citizens.It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Liberal Democrats - who have just a handful of MPs - have vowed to halt Brexit and keep Britain in the EU if they were to win the next general election.Some commentators, including former House of Commons clerk Lord Lisvane, have argued that a further referendum would be needed to ratify whatever deal the UK hammers out with the EU, but there are few signs political leaders view this as a viable option.Yes. Theresa May has appeared keen to avoid a vote on her negotiating stance, to avoid having to give away her priorities, but Theresa May has said there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. It is worth mentioning that any deal also has to be agreed by the European Parliament - with British MEPs getting a chance to vote on it there.  While there could be limitations on British nationals' ability to live and work in EU countries, it seems unlikely they would want to deter tourists. There are many countries outside the European Economic Area, which includes the 28 EU nations plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway, that British citizens can visit for up to 90 days without needing a visa and it is possible that such arrangements could be negotiated with European countries.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. In theory, the government could, if it wanted, decide to change the colour, which is currently standardised for EU countries, says the BBC's Europe correspondent, Chris Morris.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketNo nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it is ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faces being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. A second independence referendum for the country is now ""highly likely"", she has said, although not in 2017. She has said she wants Scotland to stay in the single market and said Mrs May's decision to rule out the UK staying in the single market ""undoubtedly"" brings the referendum closer.Before his resignation Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said the impact in Northern Ireland would be ""very profound"" and that the whole island of Ireland should now be able to vote on reunification. But, speaking while she was still Northern Ireland Secretary, Theresa Villiers ruled out the call from Sinn Féin for a border poll, saying the circumstances in which one would be called did not exist. The land border is likely to be a key part of the Brexit talks. Theresa May said a priority for her would be negotiating a deal with the EU which allowed a common travel area between the UK and the Republic of Ireland.During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest. But his successor Theresa May has said she will keep it in place, at least for the current Parliament, which is due to last until 2020.So far there has been a cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. There are yet to be signs that rising inflation have worried the Bank of England  enough to consider raising interest rates.  But if that happened it would make mortgages and loans more expensive to repay - but would be good news for savers.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.Eurotunnel boss Jacques Gounon said last November the reintroduction of duty-free would be ""an incredible boost for my business"" but he later said  that remark had been ""light-hearted"". Erik Juul-Mortensen, president of the Tax Free World Association (TFWA) said after the referendum vote ""it is not possible to predict how Brexit will affect the duty free and travel retail industry, and it is wiser not to make assumptions about exactly what the impact will be.""  They are at the moment but no-one knows the longer term prospects for definite. The EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - is not an EU initiative. It was negotiated between countries within a group known as the European Economic Area, often simply referred to as the single market (plus Switzerland, which confusingly is not a member of the EEA, but has agreed access to the single market). Therefore, the future of Britons' EHIC cover could depend on whether the UK decided to sever ties with the EEA.Probably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report. In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two-thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.However, the UK government is committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, the UK government is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR. However, the EU has its own European Court of Justice, whose decisions are binding on EU institutions and member states.Its rulings have sometimes caused controversy in Britain and supporters of a Brexit have called for immediate legislation to curb its powers. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also cited sovereignty and democracy, and they wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Four of the biggest US banks have committed to helping maintain the City's position. But HSBC will move up to 1,000 jobs to Paris, the BBC understands. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Pest control firm Rentokil Initial says it could make £15m extra this year thanks to a weaker currency.Others are less optimistic. Hilary Jones, a director at UK cosmetics firm Lush said the company was ""terrified"" about the economic impact. She added that while the firm's Dorset factory would continue to produce goods for the UK market, products for the European market may be made at its new plant in Germany.Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After the Leave vote, the government will probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""As with most elements of the UK economy, not enough solid data has been published yet to accurately conclude the Brexit effect on house prices. Industry figures have pointed to ""uncertainty"" among buyers and sellers that could potentially change the housing market.So far, the most significant research has come from the respected Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which has published the conclusions of a survey of its members. This primarily records sentiment among surveyors.It found that house prices are expected to fall across the UK in the three months after the referendum vote. However, the dip in prices is only expected to persist over the 12 months from June in London and East Anglia, surveyors predict.House prices were already slowing in central London, owing to the fall-out from changes to stamp duty rules in April.Separate figures from property portal Rightmove suggested the average asking price of houses coming on to the market in England and Wales fell by 0.9%, or £2,647, in July compared with June. It said that agents had reported very few sales had fallen through as a result of the vote.Many potential first-time buyers would welcome a fall in house prices, with ownership among the young falling owing to affordability concerns. Investors in property, or those who have paid off a mortgage and hope to leave homes as inheritance would be unhappy with a long-term reduction in value.  Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law following the decision to leave the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" will not necessarily disappear overnight - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU means the UK will not be part of TTIP. It will have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Former Labour health secretary Lord Owen has said that because of TTIP (see answer above) the only way to protect the NHS from further privatisation was to get out of the EU."

The government has now specified what would count as exceptional circumstances. It is not clear whether the new rules will be more or less strict than just letting councils decide what counted as exceptional circumstances. The government has described the housing market as broken, promised more affordable homes and said it would help people to buy and rent.A big question in discussions of increasing the supply of homes is whether planning regulations will be changed to make it easier to build on green belt land.Green belts were introduced after World War Two to stop cities from sprawling and countryside being spoilt. About 13% of England is now covered.This covers scenic sites open to the public, such as the Chiltern Hills and North Downs, but it also covers a lot of land that has limited public access and may not be particularly beautiful.In the House of Commons, Communities Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""In 2015, we promised the British people that the green belt was safe in our hands and that is still the case.""So what has changed?There has been little variation in the amount of green belt land since 1997, although data is not available for every year.The Housing White Paper says the current planning regulations allow building on the green belt only ""in exceptional circumstances"" but that there is no detail given of what would amount to exceptional circumstances.The government has now specified that before allowing development on green belt land, councils would need to rule out options including: The White Paper also says that councils allowing the boundaries of green belt land to be changed would have to make up for it by improving other bits of green belt. It also asks for suggestions of other things councils should take into account before doing so. Read more from Reality Check"
2017-02-07,Budget lookahead,https://web.archive.org//web/20170207223710/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-38891441,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkPhilip Hammond knows all about the government's attempts to ""get the public finances in order"" following the financial crisis of 2008.He was the man, as shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, credited by many for the tough detail of the austerity plan laid before voters in the run up to the 2010 election.George Osborne was the architect, Mr Hammond the foreman, ensuring there was a plan that might actually have a chance of working, public sector cut by public sector cut.Now Mr Hammond is the man in charge of the public finances - his dream government job and, a relatively rare occurrence for the resident of Number 11, said authoritatively to be the high water mark of his ambitions.Whatever his relations with the Prime Minister, and they are better than often reported, the fact that he doesn't want to move his sofas next door is a useful salve to any scratchiness between Downing Street's most important neighbours.Today sees the publication of the Institute for Fiscal Studies' (IFS) annual Green Budget, its analysis of Mr Hammond's room for manoeuvre as he prepares for the real Budget, on 8 March.There is one clear message.If you thought the era of cuts is over, think again.Day-to-day spending, officially known rather more prosaically as the Resource Departmental Expenditure Limit (which excludes investment spending), is set to fall by 4% over the next three years.The IFS says that a ""particularly sharp cut"" has been loaded onto the last year of the parliament, 2019-20, never a particularly comfortable time for a government to be squeezing the public sector pips even more aggressively.Alongside that, the IFS says the overall tax burden is set to rise as a proportion of national income to the highest level since 1986.That is not a function of actual tax rises - taxes for many millions of people have fallen as income tax thresholds have risen - but a function of a relatively high tax take throughout an era of pretty stagnant growth.Will Mr Hammond change course on 8 March, and further loosen the government's austerity strictures as he did in the Autumn Statement last year - pushing the deficit reduction target into the conveniently indistinct long grass of ""during the next parliament""?The government has, after all, promised an economy that works for all.I am told not - and that Mr Hammond is approaching his first Budget as a ""steady-as-she-goes affair"" with no major yanks on the national rudder, particularly given the economy's robust performance since the Brexit referendum.It has been pointed out to me that, just ahead of the triggering of Article 50 - the official mechanism for leaving the European Union - the last thing Britain needs is a reset of fiscal policy.In 2010, the Conservatives were elected as the party that would bring public income and public expenditure into balance.Mr Hammond still cleaves to that view. ""He is a Conservative,"" as one official close to him says.George Osborne's economic approach is alive and well. Yes, there are criticisms by some economists that there is no need to run a country like a household budget where pennies in and pennies out matter - governments are able to borrow at very cheap rates on the international markets and put that money to economically valuable use.Yes, there are criticisms that debt costs as a percentage of national income are low by historic standards and so the room for manoeuvre is rather greater than the national debt headline figures suggest.But those close to Mr Hammond argue that, OK, borrowing may be cheap now but servicing Britain's £1.7 trillion debt is still expensive, costing around £34bn a year, or 4.6% of all government spending.Cut out the deficit and start dealing with the debt and those costs can be brought down.Certainly, since the referendum, the cost of government debt has increased as rising inflation risk pushes up yields - the interest rate on government bonds issued to investors.Mr Hammond is briefing the Cabinet for the first time this week on the broad parameters of next month's Budget.He will talk about Britain's historic productivity problem and how to solve it, he will talk about skills, he will talk about research and development support and he will talk about infrastructure spending.Supporting the private economy is his priority, not reversing public sector cuts.Mr Hammond will also say that the new world of work - the gig economy - is affecting the way the Treasury has to approach complicated issues such as tax receipts as the number of self-employed - who tend to pay a lower proportion of their income to the state - grows.A lot of it will be rhetoric at this stage.For Mr Hammond wants to keep his powder dry.Dry for the bigger fiscal event of the year, the autumn Budget (as we should now call it) in November or December.As he said last year, he only wants one major tax and spend ""moment"" a year.And it's not going to be next month.

2017-02-07,Who is John Bercow?,https://web.archive.org//web/20170207223710/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38891841,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkHouse of Commons Speaker John Bercow has upset some MPs by voicing his opposition to US President Donald Trump giving an address to both Houses of Parliament. But who is the man in the big green chair?John Bercow, 54, sometimes refers to his favourite sport in the Commons chamber, recently revealing to MPs the heights of noisy passion he reaches when watching Davis Cup matches on TV. The minicab driver's son first picked up a racket at the age of eight. He became Middlesex under-12s champion, but later suffered bronchial asthma and was a casual player only thereafter.He became a member of the Commons tennis team, forming a doubles partnership with future Prime Minister David Cameron.He even wrote a book on his top 20 male tennis players, his favourite being Switzerland's Roger Federer.It was as a schoolboy in Finchley, then the constituency of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, that Mr Bercow became involved in politics. He joined the right-wing Monday Club, but later left, describing the views of some members as ""unpalatable"".At Essex University Mr Bercow became chairman of the Federation of Conservative Students, an organisation closed down in 1986 by Conservative Party chairman Norman Tebbit because of its radical stances and sometimes raucous behaviour.Mr Bercow was elected Conservative MP for Buckingham in 1997. But in the early 2000s his political views altered. He became a champion of gay rights and said a clampdown on cannabis smokers would be ""absurd"".After entering the shadow cabinet, he called for Conservative MPs to be banned from membership of the Monday Club.Just a few minutes before he made his comments on Mr Trump on Monday, Mr Bercow announced that he was ending the requirement for Commons clerks - the advisers who sit in front of him - to wear wigs. This didn't go down too well with some MPs, who said this could undermine Parliament's standing and ignored tradition.But Mr Bercow said he wanted to make the Commons look ""marginally less stuffy and forbidding"".After becoming Speaker in 2009, he updated his own attire by wearing a business suit, rather than the knee breeches and tights worn by his predecessors.And last week he invited Conservative MP Chloe Smith to bring her baby into the chamber during a vote on Brexit.Mr Bercow has been praised for ensuring that backbench MPs get a proper chance to question ministers. He has also had run-ins with several politicians, some of whom think he is a little too fond of his own voice.Perhaps the most notorious dispute was with Conservative MP Sir Simon Burns, who in 2010 called him a ""stupid, sanctimonious dwarf"".Mr Bercow also rebuked Prime Minister David Cameron - his old tennis partner - and once cut him off mid-point at PMQs. He has also turned on other ministers, including one for using his smartphone.Some Conservatives have complained that the Speaker has not always appeared impartial.John Bercow was not a popular choice as Speaker with his fellow Conservative MPs - although it was a secret ballot the widely-held belief is that he won his 2009 election largely as a result of backing from Labour MPs. In 2015, a visibly moved Mr Bercow survived an attempt by the Leader of the House, William Hague, to remove him from office. He was applauded by opposition benches, as happened on Monday when he made his remarks about Mr Trump.After the 2015 vote, the Telegraph journalist Bobby Friedman wrote: ""The Speaker is the archetypal Marmite man, loved by some, but loathed by many others. This is not simply a matter of mild dislike or a vague irritation.""She has disappeared somewhat from public life recently, but for a while Mr Bercow's wife Sally garnered at least as many headlines as the Speaker himself.A former right-winger who moved to the Labour Party, Mrs Bercow ran unsuccessfully for Westminster Council in 2009.She appeared on Celebrity Big Brother in 2011, being the first contestant voted off the show. During the same year she appeared in the London Evening Standard, wearing only a bed sheet and proclaiming that her husband's status acted as an ""aphrodisiac"".The Bercows, who live in a flat in the Palace of Westminster, have three children."
2017-02-07,NHS week,https://web.archive.org//web/20170207223710/http://www.bbc.com/news/health-38853700,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkNo matter where you live in the UK, you will find local NHS services are under immense pressure. None of the four nations is achieving any of its three key targets for A&E, cancer or routine treatments, such as knee and hip replacements.All have developed plans and strategies to deal with the common challenges - rising demand, squeezes on funding and the ageing population. But each has found this winter to be particularly difficult. Spending: £2,057 per personKey fact: Just one hospital trust hit the four-hour A&E target in the first week of January.The system: The NHS is split between providers of services, known as NHS trusts, and commissioners, working for clinical commissioning groups. Social care, covering care homes and help in the home, is organised by councils and is means-tested.The story so far: The first week of January was the most difficult since the four-hour target was introduced in 2014. The proportion of patients being treated or discharged in time fell below 78%, with nearly half of hospitals declaring major alerts because of a shortage of beds.An estimated one in five patients ended up facing long delays for a bed after an emergency admission - double the normal rate - while ambulance crews reported problems handing over patients to A&E staff.It comes after a gradual increase in pressures in recent years. The winters have been getting progressively worst, while the 62-day target for cancer treatment to begin following an urgent GP referral has been missed for 11 months in a row. The number of people on hospital waiting lists for a routine operation has also been rising.NHS bosses set out a five-year vision for the NHS, which involved a greater emphasis on keeping people well in the community. But savings also have to be made - there is a £22bn target for 2020. This has led to the development of 44 local plans to overhaul services - some of which involve closing hospitals and cutting staff.Spending: £2,125 per personKey fact: 63% of A&E patients were seen in four hours over the Christmas period.The system: There are five integrated health and care boards that run hospitals, community services and social care. The over-75s get free care in their own home if they have high needs.The story so far: Northern Ireland has some of the worst performance figures in the UK. During the Christmas period, the number of patients seen in four hours in A&E departments dropped to 63%.Exactly the same proportion started their cancer treatment within 62 days, according to the latest statistics, while the numbers waiting longer than they should for a routine operation have almost doubled in the past four years.In response to the growing pressures, ministers have already set out a new vision for the health service, which they acknowledged was at ""breaking point"". A 10-year plan was published in the autumn, which called for greater investment in general practice as a way of coping with the rising demands on hospitals.The plan was widely criticised for its lack of detail and costings. It did not mention hospital closures, but there is a general consensus that Northern Ireland has too many small units and care would be better concentrated in fewer bigger centres.Political instability in Northern Ireland, which is facing its second assembly election in less than a year, also means the budget for the next financial year has yet to be agreed.Spending: £2,160 per personKey fact: Scotland was the last nation to hits its A&E target - in July.The system: The NHS is run by 14 health boards that organise hospital and community services. Social care is organised by councils with personal care - that is help with  washing and dressing - provided free in people's homes and residential care if an individual has high needs. The story so far: Out of all the four nations, hospitals in Scotland seem to have fared the best. Weekly data shows four-hour performance in major units hovering around the 90% mark during January.Much of the credit has been given to the way councils and the health service are working together. Budgets have been pooled, encouraging a close working relationship to help get frail patients out of hospital by providing extra rehabilitation services in the community.But most of the progress has been concentrated in and around Glasgow and Edinburgh, where over a quarter of the population lives. Arguably, this gives Scotland an advantage, as improvements in just two regions can have a significant impact on performance.In terms of cancer treatment, over 87% started treatment within 62 days, according to the latest figures, below the 95% target.Spending: £2,084 per personKey fact: 81% of patients were seen in four hours in A&E during December.The system: The NHS is run by seven health boards that organise hospital and community services. Social care is organised by councils, which cap the cost of home care at £60 a week. The story so far: NHS Wales boss Dr Andrew Goodall has described the pressures seen this winter as ""exceptional"". Some hospitals have been reporting a 10% rise in admissions compared with 12 months previously, while the ambulance services said the start of the year had been the busiest on record.The government invested an extra £50m to help hospitals deal with winter pressures and this paid for an extra 400 beds - the equivalent of one more district general hospital.But the numbers being seen in four hours during December dropped to 81% - well below the 95% target.And the numbers waiting over 12 hours nearly hit 2,500 - a rise of two-thirds on the same period the year before.Wales has become the first part of the UK to redefine how it deals with 999 calls. Instead of requiring ambulances to reach a third of calls in eight minutes, it narrowed the number of conditions needing an urgent response and now just aims for this in abut 5% of cases. Ambulance bosses say this has allowed the service to use its fleet more effectively, which means the most life-threatening cases are getting quicker treatment.Over 86% of patients given an urgent GP referral get cancer treatment within 62-days - some way short of the 95% target.Do you have a question about the NHS?

After decades of debate, years of acrimony over the issue in the Conservative Party, months of brutal brinksmanship in Westminster, and hours of debate this week, MPs have just approved the very first step in the process of Britain leaving the European Union. There are many hurdles ahead, probably thousands of hours of debate here, years of negotiations for Theresa May with our friends and rivals around the EU, as she seeks a deal - and possibly as long as a decade of administrative adjustments, as the country extricates itself from the EU. On a wet Wednesday, the debate didn't feel epoch-making, but think for a moment about what has just happened. MPs, most of whom wanted to stay in the EU, have just agreed that we are off.  This time last year few in Westminster really thought that this would happen. The then prime minister's concern was persuading the rest of the EU to give him a better deal for the UK. His close colleagues believed the chances of them losing, let alone the government dissolving over the referendum, were slim, if not quite zero.Then tonight, his former colleagues are rubber stamping the decision of a narrow majority of the public, that changed everything in politics here for good. This isn't even the  last vote on this bill. There are several more stages, the Lords are likely to kick up rough at the start. But after tonight, for better or worse, few will believe that our journey to the exit door can be halted.As government ministers have said in recent days, the moment for turning back is past. "
2017-02-07,Brexit debate notes,https://web.archive.org//web/20170207223710/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-parliaments-38833310,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkI've got five take-outs from the Article 50 bill so far.There may be 101 pages of amendments down so far, but the government is in no mood to take any of them on board; on the contrary, their aim is to repel boarders, to the point where they would even resist the one amendment being mooted by the Brexiteer camp, which would aim to forbid ministers from accepting any extra time to extend the two year negotiating window specified by the EU's Lisbon Treaty. Ministers do believe that the EU's Michel Barnier's strategy is to enmesh the UK in a long-term negotiating limbo, perhaps including a post-Brexit transitional deal, but they don't want their hands tied.Many of the amendments, thus far, look like the product of an amendment generating bot, standard stuff about laying reports and regular debates. But ministers are wary of some of the substantive ones setting conditions - and in particular of the emotive issue of EU nationals resident in Britain, a matter now featuring regularly in most MPs' constituency surgeries. There is strong pressure for some kind of unilateral move for the UK to guarantee their right to remain - but, the government retorts, if that was passed, its backers would be to blame if one or two European states didn't reciprocate and allow UK nationals to stay within their borders.In the debate, Labour's frontbench Brexit spokesman, Sir Keir Starmer, looked and sounded like a lawyer delivering a plea in mitigation on behalf of a convicted prisoner. Early in his speech, he appealed to the Commons for a courteous hearing - something his opposite number, David Davis, would never have got away with. It just about worked, because the House genuinely wanted to hear what he had to say, but he does suffer from the lawyer-turned politician's tendency to address MPs as if they were the Court of Appeal. But leaving aside the style points, forging a line on Brexit which can stitch together the strongly pro-Brexit and strongly pro-Remain elements of Labour's heartland, let alone unify the deeply divided Parliamentary Labour Party, may prove an impossible challenge.Whether it's in the leadership ratings in Conservative Home, where he has now edged ahead of the prime minister herself, or in the growls of approval from his colleagues in the regular statements in the chamber, the Brexit Secretary, David Davis, increasingly commands the status of second minister in this government. This is not a wholly comfortable place to be - flying perilously near to the Sun - but as someone reconciled, not that long ago, to seeing out their parliamentary career on the backbenches, I suspect Mr Davis can bear it. The Lib Dems have sought to position themselves as the last champions of the Remain cause (although two of their MPs, Norman Lamb and Greg Mulholland have promised to abstain on the Article 50 Bill). But they can't claim to be the arch-opponents of Brexit and fail to maintain a presence for the big debates on it - and their leader, Tim Farron, had a chastening time at PMQs when this was pointed out. In truth, their much-reduced parliamentary party has been pretty bad at showing the flag, since the last election. It's rare to see all nine Lib Dem MPs on the green benches. This is one area where they are not very good at remaining. "

2017-02-07,Meet the EU's chief Brexit negotiator,https://web.archive.org//web/20170207223710/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37542204,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe British papers love a French villain at the heart of the EU.Is Michel Barnier about to succeed Jacques Delors as the object of their affection? The veteran Gaullist already has form.When he was Commissioner for the Internal Market and Financial Services, Mr Barnier was dubbed ""the most dangerous man in Europe"" after taking on the banking sector and championing a cap on bankers' bonuses. But while he alarmed some in the City, and will probably do so again, he also won grudging respect as a tough but even-handed negotiator.He will need all those skills and more in his new role - chief Brexit negotiator at the European Commission. And having moved seamlessly between big jobs in Paris and Brussels - French foreign minister, Commissioner, MEP - he looks well prepared. ""Don't ask me to tell you what will be at the end of the road, we haven't begun to walk yet,"" he told a conference in Brussels last month. Mr Barnier will stick closely to the official EU position of ""no negotiation without notification"" - waiting for the UK to trigger Article 50 to start the formal process of withdrawal. But he's clearly eager to get going.""I am waiting to begin,"" he said. ""I will be ready tomorrow to negotiate, frankly speaking.""And he will bring with him an instinctive pro-European agenda, and a deep knowledge of the workings of the single market.His deputy as chief Brexit negotiator is a German trade expert, Sabine Weyand, adding to the impression that Mr Barnier will lead a team that means business.One of the biggest challenges he (and his boss Jean-Claude Juncker) faces, is to ensure that representatives of the big member states don't sideline him in the Brexit divorce negotiations.But Mr Barnier's long career in French politics means he could well have the ear of the Elysee Palace, especially if - as looks likely - a centre-right candidate wins the French presidency next year. The stakes are so high that there are bound to be some clashes.Mr Barnier has sparred with the UK's Minister for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, before, when the men both served as Europe ministers in the 1990s. It is another reminder that Michel Barnier is a politician first and foremost, rather than a bureaucrat. There have certainly been criticisms - a dash of vanity, a lack of attention to detail. His career has had plenty of downs as well as ups.But he will defend his European vision to the end, and the British government would do well not to underestimate him.At the height of the eurozone crisis, Mr Barnier always refused (politely) to do broadcast interviews in English.""One wrong word,"" he told me once with a smile, ""and we could move markets.""The next few years will be equally challenging."

Scotland voted 62% in favour of Remain.The conversation online was being driven overwhelmingly by pro-independence campaigners. But people who had supported ""Better Together"" during the Scottish referendum vote also spoke about the possibility of a break-away from the UK as a result of the vote over EU membership.  Perhaps the most significant was Scottish author JK Rowling who tweeted: ""Scotland will seek independence now. Cameron's legacy will be breaking up two unions. Neither needed to happen.""Many took to Twitter to express new or strengthened pro-independence feelings in the wake of the latest vote (Just as a reminder: a ""Yes"" vote in Scotland's 2014 referendum was for independence, while the winning ""No"" campaign backed staying in the UK).One old tweet from 2014's independence referendum gained new life on Friday.

Councillors will now consider an alternative budget.BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said the prospect of such a sharp increase by a Conservative council had ""set alarm bells ringing"" in the government, which feared it would hit the ""just about managing"" group the prime minister has vowed to protect.In the Commons Mr Corbyn said he had seen leaked text messages intended for a Department for Communities and Local Government official called ""Nick"" from the leader of Surrey County Council, David Hodge.Mr Corbyn said: ""These texts read, 'I'm advised that DCLG officials have been working on a solution and you will be contacting me to agree a memorandum of understanding.'""He asked: ""Will the government now publish this memorandum of understanding and, while they're about it, will all councils be offered the same deal?""Noting that Chancellor Philip Hammond and Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt are both Surrey MPs, Mr Corbyn said:  ""But there was a second text from the Surrey County Council leader to Nick - and in the second text it says, 'The numbers you indicated are the numbers I understand are acceptable for me to accept and call off the R.'""Now, I've been reading a bit of John le Carre and apparently R means referendum. It's very subtle all this.""He added: ""He goes on to say in his text to Nick 'If it is possible that info to be sent to myself, I can then revert back soonest, really want to kill this off.'""So how much did the government offer Surrey to kill this off and is the same sweetheart deal on offer to every council facing the social care crisis created by this government?""BBC political editor Laura KuenssbergThe council, and ministers, denied there had been any stitch-up.But hours later the government admitted they had agreed, in theory, that Surrey Council could, like several others, try out keeping all of the business rates they raised from 2018, which could plug the gaps in funding in future.That change is due to be in force across England by 2020. Technically therefore, Surrey Council has not been offered any additional funding. But the prospect of more flexibility over their own income in future could help fill the council's coffers and seems to have eased some of their concerns.But as a solution to easing the pressure on social care across the country now, the idea could fall far short.Read more from LauraCouncillor Hodge told the BBC: ""There is no deal with government, there never was. End of story.""The prime minister said: ""The deal that is on offer to all councils is the one that I have already set out.""She added: ""He stands up and constantly asks for more spending, more money, more funding. What he fails to recognise is that you can only spend money on the NHS and social care if you have a strong economy to deliver the wealth that we need.""Mrs May also said of Mr Corbyn: ""He comes to the despatch box making all sorts of claims. Yet again what we get from Labour is alternative facts; what they really need is an alternative leader.""In a statement issued after Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Hodge said: ""Surrey's decision not to proceed with a 15% council tax increase was ours alone and there has been no deal between Surrey County Council and the government. ""However, I am confident that the government now understands the real pressures in adult social care and the need for a lasting solution.""Councils have been allowed to implement a 3% tax increase solely for social care over the next two years to plug the funding gap in this area. That is on top of a discretionary general increase of 2%, making a total of 5% before a referendum is needed.The Department for Communities and Local Government said: ""The government is not proposing extra funding to Surrey County Council that is not otherwise provided or offered to other councils.""It said Surrey had asked to be part of a pilot scheme under which it could keep all of the business rates raised across its area, adding that other councils could also apply to take part.Liverpool Mayor Joe Anderson said he was ""seeking urgent clarification"" about whether Surrey had been ""bought off"" by the government, adding that cities such as Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle and Birmingham had been hit ""far harder"" by funding cuts."

The three schemes are:The PAC said the department ""significantly underestimated"" the costs of the three framework schemes It also said the BEIS ""continues to expect to overspend the Framework budget"".Because of this, the cost of the three schemes will be £110 per household per year from 2020, £17 more than planned, according to the committee. Committee chairman Meg Hillier said: ""Bill-payers deserve to know whether or not the energy schemes they fund represent good value for money.""""The government has failed to meet its commitment to report annually on the impact these policies are having on bills. Current arrangements just aren't good enough.""Government must take action to address this and also ensure customers can see clearly what they are paying towards existing and future schemes through their bills,"" she added.The BEIS said the government would respond to the PAC's recommendations ""in due course"". However, it said it took action last year to ""revise renewable energy subsidies to ensure customers are protected from higher energy bills"". ""The strong, decisive action we took reduced projected costs by over £500m to protect people's household budgets and ensure value for money while delivering more environmentally friendly energy,"" added a BEIS spokesperson."

The only shortage will be of iceberg lettuces, which we think will be for about a few months - and there's a wonderful variety called cos, which is even better.""He added: ""I was pleased only this morning to hear that cauliflowers from Cornwall are coming on to the market, so we have a great opportunity to buy some British vegetables.""During the winter, Spain's south-eastern Murcia region supplies 80% of Europe's fresh produce. But after suffering its heaviest rainfall in 30 years, only 30% of its growing fields were deemed useable.This has coincided with a cold snap in Italy, which normally exports vegetables but instead had to start importing them.Lord Gardiner said his officials had spoken to workers at London's New Covent Garden, the UK's largest wholesale fruit, vegetable, and flower market, who had reported an ""improving"" supply situation."

""These are people who are have never been in this situation before and have found universal credit is wrecking their lives.""Lord Freud, who stepped down from his post in December, said the Department of Work and Pensions had spent the past nine months tackling these issues with housing payments.And he acknowledged that previously tight deadlines had already slipped by several years. Work began on the programme in 2010.But Lord Freud said the system had to be introduced in order to tackle the fact that the benefit system was an ""over-comfortable safety net"" that kept families trapped on benefits and those who were working ""wondering why they were bothering"".He said once the ""machinery"" of UC was in place, it would be possible to ""play with the parameters"" and get more people working.But he added:: ""I think it will take some decades to optimise what we are building.""We have once in a generation chance to do something like this, and if you do, you have to try to do it,  because I think we have an impossible legacy system.""A letter to Employment Minister Damian Hinds from the committee said evidence suggests ""there remains much to be done before universal credit is working well for claimants and those organisations working with them"". ""We were concerned to hear that universal credit claimants living in rented accommodation are more likely to be in rent arrears than other tenants,"" it added.""Croydon Council told us that rent collection for council tenants in receipt of universal credit has declined from 98% to 72%.""Whereas under 10% of tenants are claiming universal credit, they account for 38% of Croydon's total rent arrears.""Similarly, Halton Housing Trust reported that 920 of its 1,058 tenants claiming universal credit were in arrears. ""And while 9% of tenants claimed universal credit, they account for 37% of Halton's rent arrears.""The letter also expressed concern about delays in payments being made, with the average wait in Croydon being 12 weeks.The committee said the slow pace of change was highlighted by the fact 430,000 people were claiming UC as of December 2016, despite the government originally forecasting it would be six million.Full rollout of the benefit is now forecast in March 2022 - 11 years after it was first announced.Shadow Employment Minister Margaret Greenwood said people struggling to make ends meet could not afford to wait for the Conservatives to get UC right. ""Universal Credit is failing to make work pay, pushing people further into rent arrears and leaving them vulnerable to eviction from private landlords.""Ministers must get a grip on this failing project as a matter of urgency. They should start should by reversing cuts to in-work support that will see some working families worse off by £2,600 a year."""

In a written ministerial statement, the Home Office said it would stop receiving children via the so-called Dubs amendment at the end of March.The law, designed by peer and former refugee Lord Dubs, aimed to help some of the estimated 90,000 unaccompanied migrant children across Europe. The peer has accused ministers of a ""shameful"" decision. A legal challenge on how the government has handled the legal commitment will go ahead on Friday. Ministers accepted the Dubs amendment last year after months of pressure from campaigners and members of the public to take children from the ""Jungle"" migrant camp in Calais. The amendment to the Immigration Act 2016 required the home secretary to bring a specified number of unaccompanied refugee children to the UK after consultation with local authorities. While there was no target number written into the legislation Lord Dubs and his supporters had suggested the UK could help 3,000 of the most vulnerable. In Wednesday's statement, Immigration Minister Robert Goodwill said 200 had already arrived and a further 150 children would follow before the end of March, filling the available places offered by local authorities. A further 700 unaccompanied children had arrived in the UK under separate EU-wide rules designed to reunite families. Separately, the UK has settled 4,400 individuals directly from Middle East camps under an international programme to help displaced Syrians, half of whom are children. Responding to the decision, Lord Dubs said: ""Britain has a proud history of welcoming refugees. At a time when Donald Trump is banning refugees from America, it would be shameful if the UK followed suit by closing down this route to sanctuary for unaccompanied children just months after it was opened.""""During the Kindertransport, Sir Nicky Winton rescued 669 children from Nazi persecution virtually single-handedly. I was one of those lucky ones. It would be a terrible betrayal of his legacy if as a country we were unable to do more than this to help a new generation of child refugees.""I urge the prime minister to show leadership by continuing and building on this programme, not shutting the door to some of the most vulnerable refugee children.""Ministers say that the UK has been at the ""forefront"" of the international response to the Syria crisis, pledging more than £2.3bn in aid, the UK's largest ever spend on a single catastrophe. Help Refugees, one of the British charities working in France, had already launched legal action against the government's handling of Dubs. Its judicial review, which will be heard on Friday, argues that ministers failed to consult local authorities properly about how many unaccompanied children could be housed.Senior Church of England clergy have condemned the decision. The Bishop of Croydon, the Rt Revd Jonathan Clark, who has been involved with the church's efforts to welcome child migrants, said the government was ""in effect helping the trafficking industry"". He said: ""The Dubs amendment, as Alf Dubs originally put it forward, proposed a commitment to 3,000 children and ministers signalled that the Government would abide by the spirit of the original amendment. There is a huge question over how about 400 is in the spirit of 3,000."""
2017-02-08,Too many people 'stuck in hospital',https://web.archive.org//web/20170208235145/http://www.bbc.com/news/health-38894593,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkGovernment plans to treat more patients in the community are not easing pressure on NHS hospitals or saving money, says the National Audit Office.It looked at progress in England following the introduction of a £5.3bn Better Care Fund to help local authorities invest in services to keep patients out of hospital. It says in its first year, the fund has helped join up health and social care. But it hasn't led to the expected reduction in hospital workload. The Department of Health said it was too soon to judge the Fund's impact.  Iris Sibley's six-month wait to leave hospitalAccording to the NAO, within the first year of the Better Care Fund being introduced:The total Better Care Fund budget for 2015-16 was £5.3bn (some local authorities added extra money to the £3.8bn earmarked by the government).It was hoped the fund would return a saving of around £500m in its first year by reducing demand for costly hospital care. Using the Fund, local authorities had estimated they could cut emergency hospital admissions by 106,000. Instead, they went up by 87,000, compared to the previous year. The number of delayed transfers of care cases - when a patient is healthy enough to leave the hospital but is unable to do so - was meant to drop by 293,000. It went up by 185,000.The NAO report says cash flow worries are mounting in both health and social care and it remains unclear whether more integration of services will help. It says the government should take stock and evaluate how best to move forward. The Department of Health says it wants to make care even more joined-up. Sir Amyas Morse, head of the National Audit Office, said: ""Integrating the health and social care sectors is a significant challenge in normal times, let alone times when both sectors are under such severe pressure. So far, benefits have fallen far short of plans, despite much effort.""Its director, Ashley McDougall, said it could take years to see results from integration and suggested expectations should be lowered around the effectiveness of integration to move people out of hospital more quickly.He told BBC Radio Four's Today programme that it was not a waste of money but funding might be better spent elsewhere.A spokesman for NHS England said: ""Joining up local NHS and council services may be worthwhile, but is not by itself a silver-bullet solution to wider pressures on health and social care.""Prof Jane Dacre, president of the Royal College of Physicians, said: ""We should not take the slow progress so far as a signal to stop or reorganise the initiatives - it takes time to transform services and evaluate them to show benefit, so they should be allowed to continue, but with much more involvement from local authorities upfront in planning and implementation, and a funding boost for social care.""James Taylor from the charity Scope said: ""Over 400,000 working-age, disabled people rely on social care, but a chronic lack of funding has left many completely isolated, cut off from society, slipping into crisis and ending up in A&E.""The government's ambition to create a country that works for everyone cannot be one that leaves thousands of disabled people without the basic level of support they need to live an independent life.""

2017-02-08,Housebuilder rejects land hoarding claim,https://web.archive.org//web/20170208235145/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-38904078,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe chairman of one of the UK's top housebuilders, Redrow, has rejected accusations of land hoarding by the industry and called the government's housing White Paper ""disappointing"".Steve Morgan said the planning system was the biggest barrier to new houses. The suggestion that housebuilders were sitting on landbanks in order to maximise profits was ""completely incorrect"", he told Radio 4's Today.Mr Morgan was speaking after Redrow revealed strong half-year results.The company reported that completed house sales were up 13% in the six months to December 2016 to 2,459 compared with the same period last year and pre-tax profits were up 35% to £140m. Redrow and other big builders have enjoyed big growth in profits for the last three years, but Mr Morgan said the industry was rebuilding its profitability after suffering heavy losses in the financial crisis. ""Profits are growing, but this is a return to normal levels from a nil start,"" he said.The planning problem stemmed from difficulties in moving from outline permission - where a council says land is OK for housing - to detailed permission, when the builder can start work. ""This can take normally one year, but up to two years,"" Mr Morgan said. Redrow has just short of 26,000 plots in its landbank. ""At one-third of them, we just can't get on site.""The planning process was also inhibiting supply by dissuading smaller builders from doing more.""It's not so bad for the big builders like us, but small companies face a wall of bureaucracy. If I was starting out today, I could not build up Redrow as I did.""The housing White Paper proposed forcing housebuilders to surrender land if construction had not started two years after planning permission was granted. The current rule is three years. Mr Morgan said that if the time was counted from the grant of outline permission, it would make many projects ""impossible"".He said references in the White Paper to a ""broken"" market were ""a bit disappointing"" and added: ""Actually, a lot has been done to increase output in the last few years, but of course, there is more to be done."""

""Or if my husband and I share the school run, it's me who has forced him, dragged him away from his work.

He said it was ""not an automatic right"", but an ""earned honour"", to applause from Labour and SNP MPs.Questioned in the Commons on Tuesday about his remarks, he replied: ""The House has always understood that the chair has a role in these matters.""He added: ""I was honestly and honourably seeking to discharge my responsibilities to the House.""Mr Bercow said it was time ""to move on to other matters"".Conservative MP Sir Gerald Howarth said there had been a ""rather subdued aspect"" among his party's MPs when Mr Bercow had spoken.He added: ""I do hope that you will help us to ensure that we can have full confidence in your impartiality, because that's the way for the House to proceed.""The ""relationship between the United Kingdom and United States is an extremely important one"", Sir Gerald also said.However, Labour MP Paul Flynn said the Commons owed Mr Bercow ""a debt of gratitude for deciding that in this case such an invitation should not be supported by this House."" And SNP MP Alex Salmond, who had several run-ins with Mr Trump when he was Scottish First Minister, told Mr Bercow: ""If ever a statement deserved clapping, then yours did yesterday.""Mr Bercow is one of three ""key holders"" to Westminster Hall - where Mr Trump's predecessor Barack Obama spoke in 2011 - along with the Speaker of the House of Lords, Lord Fowler, and the Lord Great Chamberlain, a hereditary peer in charge of certain parts of the Palace of Westminster. All three must agree in order for an address to take place there. Lord Fowler addressed peers on Tuesday, saying Mr Bercow had not informed him ahead of voicing his opinion on Mr Trump, adding that Mr Bercow had told him he was ""genuinely sorry"" for this.He added: ""I don't intend to argue the case for or against Mr Trump's visit. That's not my role as Speaker.""But let me say I have spent the last 30 years campaigning against discrimination, particularly against LGBT people and people with HIV/Aids.""As speaker, Mr Bercow is the highest authority of the House of Commons and  must remain politically impartial.Several senior Conservatives have been highly critical of his comments.One unnamed Tory MP and former cabinet member told the BBC he ""must be close to standing down"" as Speaker, while another said his remarks had gone ""way beyond what is acceptable"".Conservative MP Nadine Dorries said: ""When he loses support for what was a very partisan moment I think his position will become more and more in jeopardy.""Crispin Blunt, the Conservative MP who chairs the Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee, said Mr Bercow was going to have to deal with ""the consequences"" of his comments.  He added that the Speaker, ""who's meant to referee all of this, should keep himself above that"".What is a state visit?Former Culture Secretary John Whittingdale told Sky News: ""It was a performance, it was John Bercow playing to the gallery and I think it was damaging to the national interest. I think it is regrettable that he did it.""Fellow Conservative Nadhim Zahawi, who has been critical of Mr Trump's travel ban on nationals from seven mainly Muslim countries, said the Speaker prided himself on his neutrality and to become the story was ""a bad place to be"".He said Mr Bercow had opened himself up to accusations of hypocrisy after allowing other controversial leaders, like the Chinese president, to speak, and urged him to explain his thinking to MPs.Meanwhile, Joe Wilson, a Congressman for Mr Trump's republican Party, told the BBC's Newsnight programme Mr Bercow's interjection had been ""very disappointing"".""If ever in recent years there's been a more pro-British president of the United States, it's Donald Trump,"" he said.Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage said Mr Bercow had ""abused his position"" and that to have expressed his opinions in the way he did ""devalues this great office"".But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has called for the state visit to be postponed, welcomed the intervention, while Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said Mr Trump was ""not welcome"".A petition to withdraw the invitation to the US president - and another one backing the visit - will be debated by MPs later this month.No date for Mr Trump's visit has been announced.

Mr Javid set out the details of the housing White Paper in a statement to MPs, with measures including:So-called starter homes, championed by former Prime Minister David Cameron, will be aimed at ""households that need them most"", those with combined incomes of less than £80,000, or £90,000 in London.Starter homes are new homes built for first-time buyers between 23 and 40 years old and sold at least 20% below market value. The maximum price after the discount has been applied is £250,000 outside London and £450,000 in the capital.Under the new proposals, starter home buyers will need a mortgage, ""to stop cash buyers"", and some or all of the discount will have to be repaid if the property is resold within 15 years, ""to reduce the risk of speculation"".A proposal that 20% of all larger developments had to be starter homes is to be dropped and replaced with a ""clear expectation"" that at least 10% of developments will be ""affordable home ownership units"".The 22-year-olds who bought their own home (without mum and dad's help)Ruby Willard, a recruitment consultant, and engineer Sam Bardell bought a £182,200 two-bedroom terraced house in Havant, Hampshire, last year.They took advantage of the government's Help to Buy Isa, but to save for the £18,000 deposit, it was a case of being ""quite tight"", she says.""When we decided we were going to buy, I thought I'm not going to spend money elsewhere when I don't need to...""I get commission and Sam gets overtime so we probably earn £55,000 overall, which meant we were in a position we could borrow maybe more than people on minimum wage.""Read how other 20-somethings managed to do itMr Javid said: ""Walk down your local high street today and there's one sight you're almost certain to see: young people, faces pressed against the estate agent's window, trying and failing to find a home they can afford.""With prices continuing to skyrocket, if we don't act now, a whole generation could be left behind.  We need to do better, and that means tackling the failures at every point in the system. ""The housing market in this country is broken and the solution means building many more houses in the places that people want to live.""Mr Javid admitted there was ""no one single magic bullet"" and there had to be a ""proper conversation about housing need"".Ministers have admitted the government is behind schedule in its efforts to build one million new homes in England by 2020.For Labour, shadow housing minister John Healey said: ""We hoped for better and we needed better. His disappointment will desperately disappoint millions of people struggling to cope with a housing crisis. It was feeble beyond belief.""He added: ""We were promised a White Paper; we are presented with a white flag.""The Lib Dems criticised the ""utterly vacuous"" proposals for not mentioning the government's stated aim of a million new homes by 2020, a target ministers have insisted they are still aiming for.BBC home editor Mark EastonThis government seems to speak with two voices on housing: the communities department wants to shift the balance of power firmly towards new development in places people want to live, but Number 10 and some influential Tory backbenchers are sympathetic to the passionate concerns of those who wish to protect the countryside and particularly the green belt.The real question that lies behind all the rhetoric and policy bullet-points is whether the balance of power between development and local opposition has fundamentally changed.Ministers now accept England needs 250,000 new homes every year, they have described the housing market as ""broken"" and they agree that radical change is the only way to mend it.But many have yet to be convinced that this White Paper amounts to a ""realistic plan"" to achieve that.Read more from MarkFormer Conservative housing minister Grant Shapps told the BBC's Daily Politics the problem would not be solved simply ""by slotting in a few more homes in converted former industrial sites"".He added: ""Housing ministers over the years have come out with documents or bills, and the truth is none of them are going to make much difference - and I don't suppose this will make that much difference either.""The reason is this - unless you build literally two, three, million more homes then you're not going to solve the problem.""The Local Government Association said the White Paper contained ""some encouraging signs"" on increasing housing supply and affordability.It welcomed the new ""flexibility"" around starter homes and called for new power and funding to allow councils to build affordable homes directly.The Campaign to Protect Rural England welcomed what it said was a focus on addressing current failings rather than ""meddling"" with the planning system.""We are pleased that ministers have recognised that weakening the Green Belt is unnecessary,"" said chief executive Shaun Spiers. ""But with 360,000 houses already proposed for Green Belt land the government needs to do much more to uphold national policy and stop councils releasing it for development.""Daniel Bentley, editorial director at the think tank Civitas, said: ""The problem is not sites with planning permission standing idle, except in limited circumstances.""It is with sites that are being developed, but too slowly to get ahead of demand and make any difference to the affordability of housing.""Graeme Brown, interim chief executive of the homelessness charity Shelter, said: ""The White Paper poses the right questions. What we need now is quick and bold action that helps people in need of a decent home tomorrow, not in 10 years.""

Growth is expected to be dulled as a result of inflation prompted by the decline of the value of the pound after the EU referendum.While a weaker pound is likely to improve the performance of manufacturers and exporters, higher costs for consumers will more than erase this gain, said the report.Ahmed: Public finances and the shadow of Osborne""Though the UK economy has continued to achieve solid growth, it has been almost entirely reliant on the consumer,"" said Andrew Goodwin, lead UK Economist at Oxford Economics and co-author of part of the report.""With spending power set to come under significant pressure from higher inflation and the welfare squeeze, the consumer will not be able to keep contributing more than its fair share. Exports should be a bright spot, but overall a slowdown in GDP growth appears likely.""The UK's economy could be 3% smaller by 2030 than if Britain had voted Remain, according to forecasts in the IFS's annual Green Budget.This annual analysis, ahead of next month's Budget, says spending on health, social care and benefits for sick or disabled people represents a particular risk to the public finances because it accounts for almost one third of government expenditure. The report confirms that the period between 2009 and 2014 saw the slowest rate of growth in health spending in England since the mid-1950s.And it argues that health budgets by the end of this decade will be over a billion pounds less than what is needed to cope with England's growing and ageing population, regardless of what are likely to be significant rises in demand for NHS care.  In a statement, the Treasury said: ""The government is committed to repairing the public finances and living within our means so that we can build an economy that works for all.""That has required some difficult decisions on spending, but we are determined to deliver efficient public services which provide maximum value for every pound of taxpayers' money.""Spending on public services dropped by 10% since 2010, the report said, after adjusting the figures for inflation.To meet his target of eliminating the deficit during the next parliament, which is from 2020 to 2025, Mr Hammond will probably have to find a further £34bn in tax rises and spending cuts, extending austerity.The report said £17bn of tax rises could be needed to contribute to closing the gap for government between outgoings and income.

2017-02-08,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20170208235145/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThis article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide to the UK's vote to leave the European Union. It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 52% to 48%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%, as did Wales, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who resigned on the day after losing the referendum. Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she says she will respect the will of the people. She has said ""Brexit means Brexit"" but there is still a lot of debate about what that will mean in practice especially on the two key issues of how British firms do business in the European Union and what curbs are brought in on the rights of European Union nationals to live and work in the UK. She set out more details of her negotiating hopes in her key speech on Brexit.The UK economy appears to have weathered the initial shock of the Brexit vote, although the value of the pound remains near a 30-year low, but opinion is sharply divided over the long-term effects of leaving the EU. Some major firms such as Easyjet and John Lewis have pointed out that the slump in sterling has increased their costs. Britain also lost its top AAA credit rating, meaning the cost of government borrowing will be higher. But share prices have recovered from a dramatic slump in value, with both the FTSE 100 and the broader FTSE 250 index, which includes more British-based businesses, trading higher than before the referendum. The Bank of England cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - a record low and the first cut since 2009 - after the vote and there has not been the economic slump or recession that some had predicted. Here is a regularly updated detailed rundown of how Britain's economy is doingThe European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it has to invoke an agreement called Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May has said she intends to trigger this process by the end of March 2017, meaning the UK will be expected to have left by the summer of 2019, depending on the precise timetable agreed during the negotiations. The government will also enact a Great Repeal Bill which will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. It is expected to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove.After a court battle, the UK's Supreme Court has ruled that Parliament must be consulted before Article 50 is invoked. This is why a two line Brexit bill is currently making its way through Parliament. MPs and Lords have to vote on it.The court verdict was not what the government argued for, but ministers have insisted it will not delay their planned timetable.Most MPs are expected to vote in favour of Article 50 being triggered, although there could be attempts to amend the draft legislation.Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These men - dubbed the Three Brexiteers - will play a central role in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although it will be Mrs May, as prime minister, who will have the final say. The government did not do any emergency planning for Brexit ahead of the referendum and Mrs May has rejected calls to say what her negotiating goals are.Once Article 50 has been triggered, the UK will have two years to negotiate its withdrawal. But no one really knows how the Brexit process will work - Article 50 was only created in late 2009 and it has never been used. Former Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, now Chancellor, wanted Britain to remain in the EU, and he has suggested it could take up to six years for the UK to complete exit negotiations. The terms of Britain's exit will have to be agreed by 27 national parliaments, a process which could take some years, he has argued. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. The UK will continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making.Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Following Theresa May's Brexit recent speech we now know that the UK is not intending to stay in the EU's single market. Although there has been speculation for months about the issue, it would have meant the UK staying under the auspices of the European Court of Justice and having to allow unlimited EU immigration, under freedom of movement rules.Both sides want trade to continue after Brexit with the UK seeking a positive outcome for those who wish to trade goods and services"" - such as those in the City of London and wanting a ""comprehensive free trade deal"" giving the UK ""the greatest possible access"" to the single market. Mrs May says she wants the UK to reach a new customs union deal with the EU. A customs union is where countries agree not to impose tariffs on each others' goods and have a common tariff on goods coming in from elsewhere. The UK is currently part of the EU customs union but that stops the UK being able to do its own trade deals with other countries. Reality Check: How could customs union work?These terms have increasingly been used as debate focused on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people in order to maintain access to the EU single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result.The government has declined to give a firm guarantee about the status of EU nationals currently living in the UK, saying this is not possible without a reciprocal pledge from other EU members about the millions of British nationals living on the continent. EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, will be be able to stay, the chief civil servant at the Home Office has said. The rights of other EU nationals would be subject to negotiations on Brexit and the ""will of Parliament"", he added.A lot depends on the kind of deal the UK agrees with the EU. If it remains within the single market, it would almost certainly retain free movement rights, allowing UK citizens to work in the EU and vice versa. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.Again, it depends on whether the UK government decides to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages. Citizens' Advice has reminded people their rights have not changed yet and asked anyone to contact them if they think they have been discriminated against following the Leave vote.Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested EU migrants who come to the UK as Brexit nears may not be given the right to stay. He has said there might have to be a cut-off point if there was a ""surge"" in new arrivals.People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote.The day-to-day spending impact is likely to be more significant. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it to remain at least 10% below where it was on 23 June, in the long term. This means imported goods will consequently get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have already been seen and the issue was most notably illustrated by the dispute between Tesco and Marmite's makers about whether prices would be put up or not in the stores.The latest UK inflation figures, for December, showed the CPI inflation rate jumping to 1.6%, its highest level for two years with signs of more cost pressures set to feed through in the months to come.Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration.She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations. As mentioned above, the key issue is whether other EU nations will grant the UK access to the single market, if that is what it wants, while at the same time being allowed to restrict the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK.Mrs May has said she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. It is currently running at 330,000 a year, of which 184,000 are EU citizens, and 188,000 are from outside the EU - the figures include a 39,000 outflow of UK citizens.It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Liberal Democrats - who have just a handful of MPs - have vowed to halt Brexit and keep Britain in the EU if they were to win the next general election.Some commentators, including former House of Commons clerk Lord Lisvane, have argued that a further referendum would be needed to ratify whatever deal the UK hammers out with the EU, but there are few signs political leaders view this as a viable option.Yes. Theresa May has appeared keen to avoid a vote on her negotiating stance, to avoid having to give away her priorities, but Theresa May has said there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. It is worth mentioning that any deal also has to be agreed by the European Parliament - with British MEPs getting a chance to vote on it there.  While there could be limitations on British nationals' ability to live and work in EU countries, it seems unlikely they would want to deter tourists. There are many countries outside the European Economic Area, which includes the 28 EU nations plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway, that British citizens can visit for up to 90 days without needing a visa and it is possible that such arrangements could be negotiated with European countries.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. In theory, the government could, if it wanted, decide to change the colour, which is currently standardised for EU countries, says the BBC's Europe correspondent, Chris Morris.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketNo nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it is ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faces being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. A second independence referendum for the country is now ""highly likely"", she has said, although not in 2017. She has said she wants Scotland to stay in the single market and said Mrs May's decision to rule out the UK staying in the single market ""undoubtedly"" brings the referendum closer.Before his resignation Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said the impact in Northern Ireland would be ""very profound"" and that the whole island of Ireland should now be able to vote on reunification. But, speaking while she was still Northern Ireland Secretary, Theresa Villiers ruled out the call from Sinn Féin for a border poll, saying the circumstances in which one would be called did not exist. The land border is likely to be a key part of the Brexit talks. Theresa May said a priority for her would be negotiating a deal with the EU which allowed a common travel area between the UK and the Republic of Ireland.During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest. But his successor Theresa May has said she will keep it in place, at least for the current Parliament, which is due to last until 2020.So far there has been a cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. There are yet to be signs that rising inflation have worried the Bank of England  enough to consider raising interest rates.  But if that happened it would make mortgages and loans more expensive to repay - but would be good news for savers.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.Eurotunnel boss Jacques Gounon said last November the reintroduction of duty-free would be ""an incredible boost for my business"" but he later said  that remark had been ""light-hearted"". Erik Juul-Mortensen, president of the Tax Free World Association (TFWA) said after the referendum vote ""it is not possible to predict how Brexit will affect the duty free and travel retail industry, and it is wiser not to make assumptions about exactly what the impact will be.""  They are at the moment but no-one knows the longer term prospects for definite. The EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - is not an EU initiative. It was negotiated between countries within a group known as the European Economic Area, often simply referred to as the single market (plus Switzerland, which confusingly is not a member of the EEA, but has agreed access to the single market). Therefore, the future of Britons' EHIC cover could depend on whether the UK decided to sever ties with the EEA.Probably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report. In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two-thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.However, the UK government is committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, the UK government is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR. However, the EU has its own European Court of Justice, whose decisions are binding on EU institutions and member states.Its rulings have sometimes caused controversy in Britain and supporters of a Brexit have called for immediate legislation to curb its powers. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also cited sovereignty and democracy, and they wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Four of the biggest US banks have committed to helping maintain the City's position. But HSBC will move up to 1,000 jobs to Paris, the BBC understands. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Pest control firm Rentokil Initial says it could make £15m extra this year thanks to a weaker currency.Others are less optimistic. Hilary Jones, a director at UK cosmetics firm Lush said the company was ""terrified"" about the economic impact. She added that while the firm's Dorset factory would continue to produce goods for the UK market, products for the European market may be made at its new plant in Germany.Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After the Leave vote, the government will probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""As with most elements of the UK economy, not enough solid data has been published yet to accurately conclude the Brexit effect on house prices. Industry figures have pointed to ""uncertainty"" among buyers and sellers that could potentially change the housing market.So far, the most significant research has come from the respected Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which has published the conclusions of a survey of its members. This primarily records sentiment among surveyors.It found that house prices are expected to fall across the UK in the three months after the referendum vote. However, the dip in prices is only expected to persist over the 12 months from June in London and East Anglia, surveyors predict.House prices were already slowing in central London, owing to the fall-out from changes to stamp duty rules in April.Separate figures from property portal Rightmove suggested the average asking price of houses coming on to the market in England and Wales fell by 0.9%, or £2,647, in July compared with June. It said that agents had reported very few sales had fallen through as a result of the vote.Many potential first-time buyers would welcome a fall in house prices, with ownership among the young falling owing to affordability concerns. Investors in property, or those who have paid off a mortgage and hope to leave homes as inheritance would be unhappy with a long-term reduction in value.  Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law following the decision to leave the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" will not necessarily disappear overnight - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU means the UK will not be part of TTIP. It will have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Former Labour health secretary Lord Owen has said that because of TTIP (see answer above) the only way to protect the NHS from further privatisation was to get out of the EU."

The government has now specified what would count as exceptional circumstances. It is not clear whether the new rules will be more or less strict than just letting councils decide what counted as exceptional circumstances. The government has described the housing market as broken, promised more affordable homes and said it would help people to buy and rent.A big question in discussions of increasing the supply of homes is whether planning regulations will be changed to make it easier to build on green belt land.Green belts were introduced after World War Two to stop cities from sprawling and countryside being spoilt. About 13% of England is now covered.This covers scenic sites open to the public, such as the Chiltern Hills and North Downs, but it also covers a lot of land that has limited public access and may not be particularly beautiful.In the House of Commons, Communities Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""In 2015, we promised the British people that the green belt was safe in our hands and that is still the case.""So what has changed?There has been little variation in the amount of green belt land since 1997, although data is not available for every year.The Housing White Paper says the current planning regulations allow building on the green belt only ""in exceptional circumstances"" but that there is no detail given of what would amount to exceptional circumstances.The government has now specified that before allowing development on green belt land, councils would need to rule out options including: The White Paper also says that councils allowing the boundaries of green belt land to be changed would have to make up for it by improving other bits of green belt. It also asks for suggestions of other things councils should take into account before doing so. Read more from Reality Check"

""He is a Conservative,"" as one official close to him says.George Osborne's economic approach is alive and well. Yes, there are criticisms by some economists that there is no need to run a country like a household budget where pennies in and pennies out matter - governments are able to borrow at very cheap rates on the international markets and put that money to economically valuable use.Yes, there are criticisms that debt costs as a percentage of national income are low by historic standards and so the room for manoeuvre is rather greater than the national debt headline figures suggest.But those close to Mr Hammond argue that, OK, borrowing may be cheap now but servicing Britain's £1.7 trillion debt is still expensive, costing around £34bn a year, or 4.6% of all government spending.Cut out the deficit and start dealing with the debt and those costs can be brought down.Certainly, since the referendum, the cost of government debt has increased as rising inflation risk pushes up yields - the interest rate on government bonds issued to investors.Mr Hammond is briefing the Cabinet for the first time this week on the broad parameters of next month's Budget.He will talk about Britain's historic productivity problem and how to solve it, he will talk about skills, he will talk about research and development support and he will talk about infrastructure spending.Supporting the private economy is his priority, not reversing public sector cuts.Mr Hammond will also say that the new world of work - the gig economy - is affecting the way the Treasury has to approach complicated issues such as tax receipts as the number of self-employed - who tend to pay a lower proportion of their income to the state - grows.A lot of it will be rhetoric at this stage.For Mr Hammond wants to keep his powder dry.Dry for the bigger fiscal event of the year, the autumn Budget (as we should now call it) in November or December.As he said last year, he only wants one major tax and spend ""moment"" a year.And it's not going to be next month.

2017-02-08,Who is John Bercow?,https://web.archive.org//web/20170208235145/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38891841,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkHouse of Commons Speaker John Bercow has upset some MPs by voicing his opposition to US President Donald Trump giving an address to both Houses of Parliament. But who is the man in the big green chair?John Bercow, 54, sometimes refers to his favourite sport in the Commons chamber, recently revealing to MPs the heights of noisy passion he reaches when watching Davis Cup matches on TV. The minicab driver's son first picked up a racquet at the age of eight. He became Middlesex under-12s champion, but later suffered bronchial asthma and was a casual player only thereafter.He became a member of the Commons tennis team, forming a doubles partnership with future Prime Minister David Cameron.He even wrote a book on his top 20 male tennis players, his favourite being Switzerland's Roger Federer.It was as a schoolboy in Finchley, then the constituency of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, that Mr Bercow became involved in politics. He joined the right-wing Monday Club, but later left, describing the views of some members as ""unpalatable"".At Essex University Mr Bercow became chairman of the Federation of Conservative Students, an organisation closed down in 1986 by Conservative Party chairman Norman Tebbit because of its radical stances and sometimes raucous behaviour.Mr Bercow was elected Conservative MP for Buckingham in 1997. But in the early 2000s his political views altered. He became a champion of gay rights and said a clampdown on cannabis smokers would be ""absurd"".After entering the shadow cabinet, he called for Conservative MPs to be banned from membership of the Monday Club.Just a few minutes before he made his comments on Mr Trump on Monday, Mr Bercow announced that he was ending the requirement for Commons clerks - the advisers who sit in front of him - to wear wigs. This didn't go down too well with some MPs, who said this could undermine Parliament's standing and ignored tradition.But Mr Bercow said he wanted to make the Commons look ""marginally less stuffy and forbidding"".After becoming Speaker in 2009, he updated his own attire by wearing a business suit, rather than the knee breeches and tights worn by his predecessors.And last week he invited Conservative MP Chloe Smith to bring her baby into the chamber during a vote on Brexit.Mr Bercow has been praised for ensuring that backbench MPs get a proper chance to question ministers. He has also had run-ins with several politicians, some of whom think he is a little too fond of his own voice.Perhaps the most notorious dispute was with Conservative MP Sir Simon Burns, who in 2010 called him a ""stupid, sanctimonious dwarf"".Mr Bercow also rebuked Prime Minister David Cameron - his old tennis partner - and once cut him off mid-point at PMQs. He has turned on other ministers, including one who used his smartphone in the chamber.Some Conservatives have complained that the Speaker has not always appeared impartial.John Bercow was not a popular choice as Speaker with his fellow Conservative MPs - although it was a secret ballot the widely-held belief is that he won his 2009 election largely as a result of backing from Labour MPs. In 2015, a visibly moved Mr Bercow survived an attempt by the Leader of the House, William Hague, to remove him from office. He was applauded by opposition benches, as happened on Monday when he made his remarks about Mr Trump.After the 2015 vote, the Telegraph journalist Bobby Friedman wrote: ""The Speaker is the archetypal Marmite man, loved by some, but loathed by many others. This is not simply a matter of mild dislike or a vague irritation.""She has disappeared somewhat from public life recently, but for a while Mr Bercow's wife Sally garnered at least as many headlines as the Speaker himself.A former right-winger who moved to the Labour Party, Mrs Bercow ran unsuccessfully for Westminster Council in 2009.She appeared on Celebrity Big Brother in 2011, being the first contestant voted off the show. During the same year she appeared in the London Evening Standard, wearing only a bed sheet and proclaiming that her husband's status acted as an ""aphrodisiac"".The Bercows, who live in a flat in the Palace of Westminster, have three children."
2017-02-08,NHS week,https://web.archive.org//web/20170208235145/http://www.bbc.com/news/health-38853700,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkNo matter where you live in the UK, you will find local NHS services are under immense pressure. None of the four nations is achieving any of its three key targets for A&E, cancer or routine treatments, such as knee and hip replacements.All have developed plans and strategies to deal with the common challenges - rising demand, squeezes on funding and the ageing population. But each has found this winter to be particularly difficult. Spending: £2,057 per personKey fact: Just one hospital trust hit the four-hour A&E target in the first week of January.The system: The NHS is split between providers of services, known as NHS trusts, and commissioners, working for clinical commissioning groups. Social care, covering care homes and help in the home, is organised by councils and is means-tested.The story so far: The first week of January was the most difficult since the four-hour target was introduced in 2004. The proportion of patients being treated or discharged in time fell below 78%, with nearly half of hospitals declaring major alerts because of a shortage of beds.An estimated one in five patients ended up facing long delays for a bed after an emergency admission - double the normal rate - while ambulance crews reported problems handing over patients to A&E staff.It comes after a gradual increase in pressures in recent years. The winters have been getting progressively worst, while the 62-day target for cancer treatment to begin following an urgent GP referral has been missed for 11 months in a row. The number of people on hospital waiting lists for a routine operation has also been rising.NHS bosses set out a five-year vision for the NHS, which involved a greater emphasis on keeping people well in the community. But savings also have to be made - there is a £22bn target for 2020. This has led to the development of 44 local plans to overhaul services - some of which involve closing hospitals and cutting staff.Spending: £2,125 per personKey fact: 63% of A&E patients were seen in four hours over the Christmas period.The system: There are five integrated health and care boards that run hospitals, community services and social care. The over-75s get free care in their own home if they have high needs.The story so far: Northern Ireland has some of the worst performance figures in the UK. During the Christmas period, the number of patients seen in four hours in A&E departments dropped to 63%.Exactly the same proportion started their cancer treatment within 62 days, according to the latest statistics, while the numbers waiting longer than they should for a routine operation have almost doubled in the past four years.In response to the growing pressures, ministers have already set out a new vision for the health service, which they acknowledged was at ""breaking point"". A 10-year plan was published in the autumn, which called for greater investment in general practice as a way of coping with the rising demands on hospitals.The plan was widely criticised for its lack of detail and costings. It did not mention hospital closures, but there is a general consensus that Northern Ireland has too many small units and care would be better concentrated in fewer bigger centres.Political instability in Northern Ireland, which is facing its second assembly election in less than a year, also means the budget for the next financial year has yet to be agreed.Spending: £2,160 per personKey fact: Scotland was the last nation to hits its A&E target - in July.The system: The NHS is run by 14 health boards that organise hospital and community services. Social care is organised by councils with personal care - that is help with  washing and dressing - provided free in people's homes and residential care if an individual has high needs. The story so far: Out of all the four nations, hospitals in Scotland seem to have fared the best. Weekly data shows four-hour performance in major units hovering around the 90% mark during January.Much of the credit has been given to the way councils and the health service are working together. Budgets have been pooled, encouraging a close working relationship to help get frail patients out of hospital by providing extra rehabilitation services in the community.But most of the progress has been concentrated in and around Glasgow and Edinburgh, where over a quarter of the population lives. Arguably, this gives Scotland an advantage, as improvements in just two regions can have a significant impact on performance.In terms of cancer treatment, over 87% started treatment within 62 days, according to the latest figures, below the 95% target.Spending: £2,084 per personKey fact: 81% of patients were seen in four hours in A&E during December.The system: The NHS is run by seven health boards that organise hospital and community services. Social care is organised by councils, which cap the cost of home care at £60 a week. The story so far: NHS Wales boss Dr Andrew Goodall has described the pressures seen this winter as ""exceptional"". Some hospitals have been reporting a 10% rise in admissions compared with 12 months previously, while the ambulance services said the start of the year had been the busiest on record.The government invested an extra £50m to help hospitals deal with winter pressures and this paid for an extra 400 beds - the equivalent of one more district general hospital.But the numbers being seen in four hours during December dropped to 81% - well below the 95% target.And the numbers waiting over 12 hours nearly hit 2,500 - a rise of two-thirds on the same period the year before.Wales has become the first part of the UK to redefine how it deals with 999 calls. Instead of requiring ambulances to reach a third of calls in eight minutes, it narrowed the number of conditions needing an urgent response and now just aims for this in abut 5% of cases. Ambulance bosses say this has allowed the service to use its fleet more effectively, which means the most life-threatening cases are getting quicker treatment.Over 86% of patients given an urgent GP referral get cancer treatment within 62-days - some way short of the 95% target.Do you have a question about the NHS?

2017-02-08,And we're off,https://web.archive.org//web/20170208235145/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38830552,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkIt's begun. After decades of debate, years of acrimony over the issue in the Conservative Party, months of brutal brinksmanship in Westminster, and hours of debate this week, MPs have just approved the very first step in the process of Britain leaving the European Union. There are many hurdles ahead, probably thousands of hours of debate here, years of negotiations for Theresa May with our friends and rivals around the EU, as she seeks a deal - and possibly as long as a decade of administrative adjustments, as the country extricates itself from the EU. On a wet Wednesday, the debate didn't feel epoch-making, but think for a moment about what has just happened. MPs, most of whom wanted to stay in the EU, have just agreed that we are off.  This time last year few in Westminster really thought that this would happen. The then prime minister's concern was persuading the rest of the EU to give him a better deal for the UK. His close colleagues believed the chances of them losing, let alone the government dissolving over the referendum, were slim, if not quite zero.Then tonight, his former colleagues are rubber stamping the decision of a narrow majority of the public, that changed everything in politics here for good. This isn't even the  last vote on this bill. There are several more stages, the Lords are likely to kick up rough at the start. But after tonight, for better or worse, few will believe that our journey to the exit door can be halted.As government ministers have said in recent days, the moment for turning back is past. "
2017-02-08,Brexit debate notes,https://web.archive.org//web/20170208235145/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-parliaments-38833310,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkI've got five take-outs from the Article 50 bill so far.There may be 101 pages of amendments down so far, but the government is in no mood to take any of them on board; on the contrary, their aim is to repel boarders, to the point where they would even resist the one amendment being mooted by the Brexiteer camp, which would aim to forbid ministers from accepting any extra time to extend the two year negotiating window specified by the EU's Lisbon Treaty. Ministers do believe that the EU's Michel Barnier's strategy is to enmesh the UK in a long-term negotiating limbo, perhaps including a post-Brexit transitional deal, but they don't want their hands tied.Many of the amendments, thus far, look like the product of an amendment generating bot, standard stuff about laying reports and regular debates. But ministers are wary of some of the substantive ones setting conditions - and in particular of the emotive issue of EU nationals resident in Britain, a matter now featuring regularly in most MPs' constituency surgeries. There is strong pressure for some kind of unilateral move for the UK to guarantee their right to remain - but, the government retorts, if that was passed, its backers would be to blame if one or two European states didn't reciprocate and allow UK nationals to stay within their borders.In the debate, Labour's frontbench Brexit spokesman, Sir Keir Starmer, looked and sounded like a lawyer delivering a plea in mitigation on behalf of a convicted prisoner. Early in his speech, he appealed to the Commons for a courteous hearing - something his opposite number, David Davis, would never have got away with. It just about worked, because the House genuinely wanted to hear what he had to say, but he does suffer from the lawyer-turned politician's tendency to address MPs as if they were the Court of Appeal. But leaving aside the style points, forging a line on Brexit which can stitch together the strongly pro-Brexit and strongly pro-Remain elements of Labour's heartland, let alone unify the deeply divided Parliamentary Labour Party, may prove an impossible challenge.Whether it's in the leadership ratings in Conservative Home, where he has now edged ahead of the prime minister herself, or in the growls of approval from his colleagues in the regular statements in the chamber, the Brexit Secretary, David Davis, increasingly commands the status of second minister in this government. This is not a wholly comfortable place to be - flying perilously near to the Sun - but as someone reconciled, not that long ago, to seeing out their parliamentary career on the backbenches, I suspect Mr Davis can bear it. The Lib Dems have sought to position themselves as the last champions of the Remain cause (although two of their MPs, Norman Lamb and Greg Mulholland have promised to abstain on the Article 50 Bill). But they can't claim to be the arch-opponents of Brexit and fail to maintain a presence for the big debates on it - and their leader, Tim Farron, had a chastening time at PMQs when this was pointed out. In truth, their much-reduced parliamentary party has been pretty bad at showing the flag, since the last election. It's rare to see all nine Lib Dem MPs on the green benches. This is one area where they are not very good at remaining. "

2017-02-08,Meet the EU's chief Brexit negotiator,https://web.archive.org//web/20170208235145/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37542204,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe British papers love a French villain at the heart of the EU.Is Michel Barnier about to succeed Jacques Delors as the object of their affection? The veteran Gaullist already has form.When he was Commissioner for the Internal Market and Financial Services, Mr Barnier was dubbed ""the most dangerous man in Europe"" after taking on the banking sector and championing a cap on bankers' bonuses. But while he alarmed some in the City, and will probably do so again, he also won grudging respect as a tough but even-handed negotiator.He will need all those skills and more in his new role - chief Brexit negotiator at the European Commission. And having moved seamlessly between big jobs in Paris and Brussels - French foreign minister, Commissioner, MEP - he looks well prepared. ""Don't ask me to tell you what will be at the end of the road, we haven't begun to walk yet,"" he told a conference in Brussels last month. Mr Barnier will stick closely to the official EU position of ""no negotiation without notification"" - waiting for the UK to trigger Article 50 to start the formal process of withdrawal. But he's clearly eager to get going.""I am waiting to begin,"" he said. ""I will be ready tomorrow to negotiate, frankly speaking.""And he will bring with him an instinctive pro-European agenda, and a deep knowledge of the workings of the single market.His deputy as chief Brexit negotiator is a German trade expert, Sabine Weyand, adding to the impression that Mr Barnier will lead a team that means business.One of the biggest challenges he (and his boss Jean-Claude Juncker) faces, is to ensure that representatives of the big member states don't sideline him in the Brexit divorce negotiations.But Mr Barnier's long career in French politics means he could well have the ear of the Elysee Palace, especially if - as looks likely - a centre-right candidate wins the French presidency next year. The stakes are so high that there are bound to be some clashes.Mr Barnier has sparred with the UK's Minister for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, before, when the men both served as Europe ministers in the 1990s. It is another reminder that Michel Barnier is a politician first and foremost, rather than a bureaucrat. There have certainly been criticisms - a dash of vanity, a lack of attention to detail. His career has had plenty of downs as well as ups.But he will defend his European vision to the end, and the British government would do well not to underestimate him.At the height of the eurozone crisis, Mr Barnier always refused (politely) to do broadcast interviews in English.""One wrong word,"" he told me once with a smile, ""and we could move markets.""The next few years will be equally challenging."

Scotland voted 62% in favour of Remain.The conversation online was being driven overwhelmingly by pro-independence campaigners. But people who had supported ""Better Together"" during the Scottish referendum vote also spoke about the possibility of a break-away from the UK as a result of the vote over EU membership.  Perhaps the most significant was Scottish author JK Rowling who tweeted: ""Scotland will seek independence now. Cameron's legacy will be breaking up two unions. Neither needed to happen.""Many took to Twitter to express new or strengthened pro-independence feelings in the wake of the latest vote (Just as a reminder: a ""Yes"" vote in Scotland's 2014 referendum was for independence, while the winning ""No"" campaign backed staying in the UK).One old tweet from 2014's independence referendum gained new life on Friday.

2017-02-09,Child migrant scheme closure 'shameful',https://web.archive.org//web/20170210013631/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38918317,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkChurch leaders, MPs and peers have condemned the decision to end the ""Dubs amendment"" scheme to let unaccompanied migrant children in to the UK.The Archbishop of Canterbury said he was ""shocked"", while Labour's Yvette Cooper described it as ""shameful"".Ministers said 350 children would have arrived under the scheme by the time it ended in March but that there were fears it encouraged people traffickers.Theresa May says what the UK is doing to help refugees is ""absolutely right"".The prime minister pointed to separate schemes that will resettle 20,000 Syrian refugees from camps in the region as well as reuniting migrant children with families already in the UK.The Dubs amendment, designed by the Labour peer and former child refugee Lord Dubs, aimed to help some of the estimated 90,000 unaccompanied migrant children across Europe. It was accepted by then Prime Minister David Cameron last year after he was faced with a rebellion in the House of Lords. While there was no target number specified in law, Lord Dubs and his supporters had suggested the UK could help 3,000 of the most vulnerable.On Wednesday, ministers announced that 200 children had been brought in under the scheme and that it would close after another 150 were settled in the UK.Home Secretary Amber Rudd defended the decision, which she said had been made after France raised concerns it could be encouraging more children to make the perilous journey to Europe.Speaking in the Commons, she said: ""I am clear that when working with my French counterparts they do not want us to indefinitely continue to accept children under the Dubs amendment because they specify, and I agree with them, that it acts as a draw. ""It acts as a pull. It encourages the people traffickers.""She said the government remained committed to accepting 3,000 child refugees from crisis-hit regions such as Syria.The move has prompted fierce criticism from MPs, including those from the Tory party, as well as the Archbishop of Canterbury.Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott attacked Ms Rudd, asking: ""How does she live with herself?""Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron attacked the government for a ""betrayal of these vulnerable children and a betrayal of British values"", while Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley said the decision was ""an absolute disgrace"".Tory MP David Burrowes said it looks like the government has ""cut and run from child refugees"" while Conservative MP Heidi Allen MP said she would support a judicial review on the decision.The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby said the UK had a ""great history of welcoming those in need"" and hoped the government would reconsider its decision.The Bishop of Croydon, the Rt Revd Jonathan Clark, who has been involved with efforts to welcome child migrants, said the government was ""in effect helping the trafficking industry"".While Lord Dubs said: ""I believe in arbitrarily closing down the scheme, without any good reason for doing so, the government is in breach of its own commitments.""However, the prime minister has defended the government's approach to refugees by pointing to various other schemes adopted to bring them into the UK.She said: ""We have been seeing quite a number of children and families being resettled here in the United Kingdom and I think what we are doing in terms of refugees is absolutely right."" The total number of children to accept under the Dubs amendment was reached after consultation with local authorities - with councils indicating they could provide care to no more than 350 unaccompanied child migrants. David Simmonds, chairman of the Local Government Association's asylum, refugee and migration task group, said councils had ""demonstrated tremendous leadership at a local, regional and national level in resettling the children from the Calais camp.""A legal challenge on how the government has handled the legal commitment will go ahead on Friday.

Ms Long-Bailey, MP for Salford and Eccles, was previously shadow chief secretary to the Treasury and was described by Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell as a ""brilliant"" member of the ""next generation of our socialist leadership team"" last week. Ms Hayman, MP for Workington in West Cumbria, was a shadow environment minister before her promotion, while Ms Rees, MP for Neath, was a shadow justice minister. Mr Dowd is MP for Bootle.Ms Rees and Ms Hayman both nominated Owen Smith in his unsuccessful challenge to Mr Corbyn's leadership in 2016.There are now 14 women in Mr Corbyn's 29-member shadow cabinet.The Labour Party said that more junior shadow ministerial roles would be filled ""in due course"".What is striking about this announcement is not who has been appointed, and to which job - it is the leadership's approach to the frontbenchers among the 52 Labour rebels who defied Jeremy Corbyn in last night's vote on Brexit. Most of them tonight are still in a job, despite abandoning the collective responsibility of the party's official position and ignoring their leader. I understand it's unlikely there will be any sackings. This in itself is extraordinary, not least because among the rebels were three whips, the very people responsible for party discipline. It illustrates what you might call Jeremy Corbyn's human resources challenge. When you discount those who won't serve under him, and those who have but no longer do, his options are limited.Mr Lewis announced his resignation from the party's front bench as MPs began voting for the final time on the Brexit bill on Wednesday.In a letter to Mr Corbyn, he wrote that he was leaving the shadow cabinet ""with a very heavy heart"", but Labour had not won ""the protections the people of this country need"" during the Commons debates on Brexit.Asked on the BBC about Mr Lewis's departure, Mr Corbyn said: ""It's not a disaster. ""The majority of Labour MPs voted to trigger Article 50. Fifty-odd voted against it, mainly on the basis of their strong message from their own constituents.""Labour's chief whip Nick Brown will handle any disciplinary action to be taken against the 52 Labour MPs who rebelled against the party line and voted against the Brexit bill on Wednesday."

James Duddridge said Mr Bercow had ""overstepped the mark"" although he did not expect his motion to be debated.The Speaker is the highest authority of the House of Commons and is expected to remain politically impartial.Who is John Bercow?Mr Duddridge told the BBC: ""I've done this because Speaker Bercow for a long time has been overstepping the mark and with his comments on the state visit [of President Trump] he has clearly expressed views.""That is not the role of the Speaker, and it is impossible for him to chair debates as Speaker adjudicating on things he has expressed a view on.""I've tabled a motion to the House of Commons. I expect over the week of recess for people to be supporting that but they can't actually sign it until the first day back. ""But to be frank, I think there's a very real possibility that once the level of discontent is known and Speaker Bercow sees the writing is on the wall he will go of his own accord.""BBC Parliamentary correspondent Mark D'Arcy said other senior backbenchers doubt that Mr Duddridge's tactics would work.He said Mr Bercow has a reservoir of support on the backbenches - particularly among pro-Brexit Conservative backbenchers - and was seen to have enabled MPs to challenge the government far more effectively. Mr Duddridge, Conservative MP for Rochford and Southend East, had already written to the prime minister, asking for MPs to be given a free vote if there was a vote of no confidence in the Speaker.Conservative MP Alec Shelbrooke tweeted on Thursday that he disagreed with President Trump's executive order barring migrants from seven countries but added: ""John Bercow has politicised the office of Speaker and his position is untenable.""But fellow Conservative Claire Perry said on BBC One's Question Time: ""I think for us to try and remove a speaker over something that he said would be really rather drastic. He's entitled to his opinions, perhaps he just shouldn't have addressed them on this particular issue.""Meanwhile an early day motion calling for officials to withhold permission for Mr Trump to address Parliament, has now been signed by 204 MPs - largely from the Labour Party.That motion was sponsored by the Labour MP Stephen Doughty - whose point of order about it on Monday prompted Mr Bercow's initial comments.President Trump has accepted an invitation from the Queen for a state visit to the UK, which can include an address to both Houses of Parliament, later this year.However, responding to a point of order in the Commons on Monday, Mr Bercow said he was opposed to Mr Trump speaking to MPs and peers saying it was ""not an automatic right"", but an ""earned honour"", to applause from Labour and SNP MPs.He has since said it was time ""to move on to other matters"".In March 2015 a bid to change the rules on electing Commons speakers - which was seen by some as a bid by the Tory leadership to oust Mr Bercow - was defeated by 228 votes to 202. Mr Bercow is one of three ""key holders"" to Westminster Hall - where Mr Trump's predecessor Barack Obama spoke in 2011 - along with the Speaker of the House of Lords, Lord Fowler, and the Lord Great Chamberlain, a hereditary peer in charge of certain parts of the Palace of Westminster. All three must agree in order for an address to take place there. No date for Mr Trump's visit has been announced. "

It's very subtle all this.""He added: ""He goes on to say in his text to Nick, 'If it is possible for that info to be sent to... myself, I can then revert back soonest. Really want to kill this off.'""So how much did the government offer Surrey to kill this off and is the same sweetheart deal on offer to every council facing the social care crisis created by this government?""Business rate pilotIn a statement, Mr Javid said Surrey County Council's budget and council tax ""is a matter for the council"", adding it ""had been clear that their budget decision (setting a level of council tax which is not above the referendum threshold) was theirs alone"".Under the Local Government Finance Settlement, the Department for Communities and Local Government discussed funding with councils across the country ""of all types and all political colours"", he said.""Whilst the final settlement has yet to be approved, the government is not proposing extra funding to Surrey County Council that is not otherwise provided or offered to other councils generally,"" Mr Javid said.""There is no 'memorandum of understanding' between government and Surrey County Council.""He said Surrey had asked to take part in the pilot of a new business rates scheme, adding that other councils could also apply to take part.Downing Street said all conversations between the government and Surrey had been ""entirely appropriate"" and there was no ""sweetheart deal"".The proposed 15% rise was mooted by Surrey Council to cover what it said were shortfalls in funding to cover the rising costs of social care.But plans for a referendum - which are triggered if a local authority proposes a council tax rise of 5% or more - were dropped during a full council meeting on Tuesday. Councillors will now consider an alternative budget.Mr Hodge told the BBC: ""There is no deal with government, there never was - end of story.""The prime minister said: ""The deal that is on offer to all councils is the one that I have already set out.""Councils have been allowed to implement a 3% tax increase solely for social care over the next two years to plug the funding gap in this area. That is on top of a discretionary general increase of 2%, making a total of 5% before a referendum is needed.Liverpool Mayor Joe Anderson said he was ""seeking urgent clarification"" about whether Surrey had been ""bought off"" by the government, adding that cities such as Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle and Birmingham had been hit ""far harder"" by funding cuts."

The European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill was approved by 494 votes to 122 on Wednesday, and now moves to the House of Lords.Mr Lewis, who earlier said he was undecided on whether to support the bill, announced his resignation as MPs began voting for the final time on Wednesday.In a letter to Mr Corbyn, he wrote that he was leaving the shadow cabinet ""with a very heavy heart"", but Labour had not won ""the protections the people of this country need"" during the Commons debates on Brexit.Mr Lewis added: ""I know you understand the deep divide this issue has opened up in the country and it is to your credit that you have lead the debate in our party such an open and comradely way.""Asked on BBC Breakfast about Mr Lewis's departure, Mr Corbyn said: ""It's not a disaster. The majority of Labour MPs voted to trigger Article 50. Fifty-odd voted against it, mainly on the basis of their strong message from their own constituents.""My argument is it was a national vote, it was a national referendum, and Parliament has to respect that.""He added that the party would continue ""demanding from the government social justice in Britain"".One of the stars of the 2015 parliamentary intake, Clive Lewis is seen by many on Labour's left as a potential successor to Jeremy Corbyn.He was born in London and grew up on a council estate in Northampton, moving on to become a BBC TV reporter.Mr Lewis has quickly established himself as one of the most high-profile Corbynite MPs, rising from backbencher to shadow defence secretary in a matter of months. He became shadow business secretary last October.Mr Lewis's resignation from Labour's frontbench team occurs as the party continues to grapple with the UK's exit from the European Union.In a interview with the Guardian in August, the MP for Norwich South said: ""I've been thrust too quickly into the shadow cabinet. I want to be in my constituency. I want to be a constituency MP."" His exit from the shadow cabinet means he can do just that.Asked about the US president's planned state visit, Mr Corbyn said: ""My position is Donald Trump should not be coming to the UK.""I think we have to have relations with the USA. I'm not sure he's going to want to have a meeting with us.""He added: ""The point is Donald Trump has been promoting something that undermines international law. He's been promoting misogyny. He's been making some awful statements in the USA. He's threatened to build a wall against Mexico.""Our government seems to think this is a man they should do deals with.""Mr Corbyn also said: ""I think it would be right to meet the president of the USA, but I think it would be wrong for him to come here."""

MPs pass motion of 'no confidence' in FA",https://web.archive.org//web/20170210013631/http://www.bbc.com/sport/football/38920489,"A motion of ""no confidence"" in the Football Association has been passed by MPs debating the organisation's ability to reform itself.While the motion is largely symbolic, MPs have warned legislation will be brought in if changes are not made.Sports Minister Tracey Crouch has said the FA could lose £30m-£40m of public funding if it does not modernise.Culture, Media and Sport (CMS) Select Committee chairman Damian Collins said: ""No change is no option.""He added: ""The FA, to use a football analogy, are not only in extra time, they are at the end of extra time, in 'Fergie time'. They are 1-0 down and if they don't pick up fairly quickly, reform will be delivered to them.""I would have thought with the state of the NHS, the lack of building, not enough cash for defence, that [MPs] would put energy into that not the organisation of footballFA chairman Greg Clarke has said he will quit if the organisation cannot win government support for its reform plans.""I watched the debate and respect the opinions of the MPs,"" he said.""As previously stated, we remain committed to reforming governance at the FA to the agreed timescale of the minister.""Collins suggested ministers should intervene to overhaul English football's governing body because ""turkeys won't vote for Christmas"" and it will not reform itself.Crouch warned the FA that if it played ""Russian roulette"" with public money it will lose.The minister also said the government would be prepared to consider legislation if the FA fails to present plans for required reforms before April. However she felt the debate - which was sparsely attended by MPs - was premature given her desire to see the FA's proposals.
                            Media playback is not supported on this device
                        The committee has published two reports since 2010 recommending greater representation at the FA for fans and the grassroots game, as well as more diversity in positions of authority. It also wants to dilute the perceived dominance of the Premier League.Collins has said the FA was given six months to meet the government guidance on best practice for sports governance but had failed to do so. That guidance called for things such as a move towards gender equality on boards, more independent oversight, more accountability and term limits for office bearers.He was joined by fellow Tories and Labour MPs - keen to ensure the ""national game"" is run correctly - in bemoaning the current state of the FA.The cross-party motion stated that MPs have no confidence in the FA's ability to comply fully with its duties as its existing governance structures make it ""impossible for the organisation to reform itself"".It was approved unopposed at the end of a backbench business debate, which was attended by fewer than 30 MPs.The FA is effectively run by its own parliament, the FA Council, which has 122 members - just eight are women and only four from ethnic minorities. More than 90 of the 122 members are aged over 60.Shadow sports minister Rosena Allin-Khan said: ""Not only is diversity not in the heart of the FA ,it isn't in its body, or even its soul.""Labour MP Keith Vaz, whose constituency of Leicester East is home to the Premier League champions Leicester City, added: ""A quarter of all professional footballers are black, however only 17 of the 92 top clubs have an ethnic minority person in a senior coaching role.""However, Keith Compton - one of 25 FA life vice-presidents and a director of Derbyshire FA - questioned why the FA was being discussed in Parliament.""It is pity that the MPs have got nothing better to do,"" he told BBC Radio 5 live.""I would have thought with the state of the NHS, the lack of building, too many people living in boxes,  not enough cash for defence, that some people would put energy into that not the organisation of football.""Football is reforming all of the time.""Asked whether there should be more female and ethnic minority involvement in FA decisions, he said: ""That's not really the responsibility of the council. If those people were interested enough, and we had enough people, we would have enough women and other people on the FA.""I have heard people say supporters aren't represented but that is not true. They have one representative. People want the council to be reduced and now I am hearing it should be increased.""Responding to the interview, former FA chairman David Bernstein said: ""I think if you want an argument for change, you've just heard it.""And Yunus Lunat, the first Muslim to get a seat on the FA Council before leaving three years ago, said new recruits were needed.""No-one is disputing the contribution the previous generation has made but there comes a time when you have got to recognise that you are not the most suitable people for the role,"" he said.BBC sports editor Dan RoanThe debate may have been attended by fewer MPs than is needed for a full football match, but the fact a motion of no confidence in the FA was passed still gives it an embarrassing bloody nose, ramping up the pressure on the governing body. The few MPs who spoke seemed to mostly agree with each other, demanding greater diversity on the council, independent directors and fan representation on the board, and raising concerns over the clout and money of the professional clubs, especially the Premier League. But the people who really matter here are the government. The sports minister said the debate was ""premature"" and reiterated that she may consider the nuclear option of legislation to force through reforms - but only if a threat to cut funding does not work. That however, remains some way off and the FA is confident it can comply with a new code of governance. If it fails, chairman Greg Clarke has vowed to step down and then it really will be in the last-chance saloon.

                        Football Supporters' Federation chairman Malcolm Clarke: ""We're very pleased to see so many MPs back our proposals for a minimum of five fan representatives on the FA Council, representation on the FA board, and increased diversity.""Supporters are integral to the health of our national sport yet are still shockingly under-represented in the FA hierarchy - the FA Council has only one supporter representative, yet the Armed Forces and Oxbridge have five.""It is also important to acknowledge that the FA Council has stood up to rampant commercialism within the game and protected fans' interests - such as when the FA Council stopped the 'Hull Tigers' name change.""Sports minister Tracey Crouch: ""The FA's current model does not, in my opinion, and clearly that of other colleagues, stand up to scrutiny. Reform is therefore required."" Judith Cummins (Labour, Bradford South): ""At best they're dragging their feet, at worst they're wilfully failing to act.""Andrew Bingham, CMS Select Committee member: ""The issues of Sam Allardyce, who manages the (England) team for 67 days, one game, walks away with allegedly around £1m, it is destroying people's faith in football.""Nigel Huddleston (Conservative, Mid Worcestershire): ""I have a great deal of respect for Greg Clarke but I sense his hands are tied and a sense of institutional inertia pervades the governance of football in this country.""

2017-02-09,"Worst A&E waits ever, leak suggests",https://web.archive.org//web/20170210013631/http://www.bbc.com/news/health-38907492,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkRecord numbers of patients spent more than four hours in accident and emergency units in England in January, figures leaked to the BBC suggest.During a difficult winter for the NHS, January appears to be the worst performing month in the past 13 years.The figures also suggest record numbers of people waited longer than 12 hours for a hospital bed once seen in A&E.The BMA said the prime minister could no longer ""bury her head in the sand"" over increasing pressure in the NHS. And it accused the government of failing to grasp the seriousness of the situation.But a spokesman from the Department of Health said the vast majority of patients were seen and treated quickly, and busy periods in hospitals were supported by an extra £400 million of funding.The figures come from a document compiled by NHS Improvement, a regulator in England.It appears to show that from a total of more than 1.4 million attendances at A&E during January:It comes as official NHS figures for December show that 86.2% of A&E patients in England were dealt with in under four hours.December A&E figures for Scotland are much higher at 92.6% while Wales and Northern Ireland's figures are lower than England's. January's leaked figures for England are provisionally the worst monthly figures on record since the four-hour target was introduced in 2004.The situation in England has worsened since last January when more than 51,000 people had ""trolley waits"" of between four and 12 hours in A&E and 158 people had waits of more than 12 hours.Jennifer's 95-year-old mother went into Norwich Hospital A&E with a bad chest infection at 9am and was still waiting for a bed until after 10pm on the same day. She ended up in a ward, where she stayed for a couple of days - but not before being moved three times during the night.""At the time I was very upset because there was no care or anything. I was so angry,"" Jennifer said.""Previously she'd been to A&E on Monday 30 January but got sent home. ""It wasn't getting any better on the Wednesday, so the ambulance was called again.""I know the NHS is in a bad way but it doesn't help a 95-year-old."" Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt recently suggested the four-hour target could be changed to apply to urgent health problems in A&E, rather than more minor ones.A spokesman from the Department of Health said they did not recognise the figures.""It is irresponsible to publish unverified data and does a disservice to all NHS staff working tirelessly to provide care around the clock.""Sorry, your browser cannot display this content.But the Royal College of Emergency Medicine said their figures backed up those seen by the BBC.Vice-president Dr Chris Moulton said: ""While increasing numbers of doctors is vital, the more pressing problem is a lack of beds.""We simply do not have any more room to put patients - we have the lowest number of acute beds per capita in Europe.""""As a result, bed occupancy is at dangerous levels and exit block is putting lives at risk.""President Dr Taj Hassan, told the BBC's Today programme that the more crowded emergency departments were, the higher the risk that patients could die.""The care being delivered results in patients being compromised - because of delays in getting pain relief in time, getting antibiotics in time,"" he said.""Delays to assessment will also compromise care,"" he added.Dr Mark Porter, who chairs the British Medical Association council, said doctors had reported that this winter had been ""extraordinarily tough"" in hospitals.""When social care isn't available, patients experience delays in moving from hospital to appropriate ongoing care settings - preventing patients being admitted at the front end in A&E,"" Dr Porter said.

2017-02-09,Home repossessions 'lowest since 1982',https://web.archive.org//web/20170210013631/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-38918337,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkFewer homes were repossessed last year than in any year since 1982 - but lenders are warning that mortgage rates will not always be so favourable.A total of 7,700 UK homes were repossessed last year compared with 10,200 in 2015, figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) show.Homes are seized in this way if borrowers are consistently unable to meet their mortgage repayments.The CML said that falling mortgage interest rates had eased the burden.""Customers do need to be ready for a time when the outlook may not be so benign, with pressure on real incomes increasing and as interest rates begin to move upwards again,"" said CML director general Paul Smee, forecasting a rise in repossessions in 2017.The figures reveal that the proportion of buy-to-let properties that are being repossessed has risen significantly.At the recent peak of home seizures in 2009, about a tenth of the homes repossessed were in the buy-to-let sector. Although the total number of home repossessed from landlords has fallen, this now represents a third of the total.The number of homes repossessed overall fell in the final three months of the year, down from 1,900 in the third quarter of the year to 1,800 in the fourth quarter.Mortgage-holders falling into arrears on their home loans also fell compared with the previous year.The were 94,100 mortgages with arrears of 2.5% or more of the outstanding balance by the end of 2016, the CML said, compared with 101,700 at the end of 2015.This was slightly up on the 93,300 mortgages in this position by the end of September.Ever since the number of repossessions reached nearly 50,000 in 2009, at a time of deep recession and economic hardship, banks and building societies have been under intense pressure to show more forbearance to families facing financial crisis.Regulators told them to look for warning signs that people were in difficulty and, where they could, to take action to help by reducing monthly payments or allowing complete payment holidays or letting borrows pay off their loans over a longer period.The flexibility has had a clear effect at a time when mortgages have in any case become much cheaper, because of sharp reductions in interest rates.However, the Council of Mortgage Lenders warns today that repossessions are likely to rise from here, probably back up to around 10,000 this year.It says household budgets could come under strain as a result of rising prices in the shops.Lenders and the courts have been far less speedy in seeking repossessions in recent years owing to pressure from the government, and the low levels of interest rates.However, the CML said people fearing financial difficulty should not bury their heads in the sand.""Borrowers who fear they may miss a payment should speak to their lender. Lenders remain committed to helping borrowers work through any period of temporary payment difficulty and remain in their home wherever possible,"" Mr Smee said.Jonathan Harris, director of mortgage broker Anderson Harris, said: ""We suspect that when it comes to their finances there are many people teetering on a knife edge and rate rises could easily push them over.""While it looks unlikely that interest rates will rise anytime soon, borrowers still need to plan ahead and consider how they would cope with higher mortgage rates.""

2017-02-09,New support for British spaceports,https://web.archive.org//web/20170210013631/http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-38920584,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe government is looking to push forward commercial spaceflight activity in the UK with a series of grants totalling £10m.The money is aimed at consortia that want to start launching satellites - and even people - from British soil.Previous feasibility work has already identified a number of aerodromes that might make suitable spaceports - from Cornwall to Scotland.Ministers also intend to introduce supporting legislation.As the law stands, the rocket planes and other launch systems currently in development around the world would not be able to operate out of the UK.The legislation would put in place the necessary regulatory and licensing framework.A Spaceflight Bill is likely to be tabled towards the end of the month.To win grants, consortia will have to show how they will ""develop spaceflight capabilities, such as building spaceport infrastructure or adapting launch vehicle technology for use in the UK"".Ministers have identified space as a key sector that can help rebalance the services-dominated British economy.They regard satellites as one of the ""eight great technologies"" that will lead to significant growth opportunities. And in recent years, the UK has made heavy investments into industry through the European Space Agency to support this strategy.But satellites have to get into space to be useful and the business of launching them also has the potential to bring significant earnings - particularly now that low-cost launch systems are becoming available.Announcing the new grants, Science Minister Jo Johnson said the commercial spaceflight market could be worth an estimated £25bn over the next 20 years.""Spaceflight offers the UK the opportunity to build on our strengths in science, research and innovation,"" he said.""It provides opportunities to expand into new markets, creating highly-skilled jobs and boosting local economies across the country. That is why it is one of the key pillars of our Industrial Strategy.""We want to see the UK space sector flourish, that is why we are laying the groundwork needed for business to be able to access this lucrative global market.""A number of consortia are already pushing to use horizontal launch systems.These would see rockets carried by planes to an altitude where they would then be released to make their way into orbit to deliver a satellite.For safety reasons, this activity would be done somewhere over the ocean, but ministers have not ruled out the possibility that conventional vertical lift-off rockets could also be launched from the UK.And although satellites are the focus of business leaders, it is conceivable that ""tourist"" flights on sub-orbital rocket planes could become part of the services being offered as well. In 2014, the government identified eight coastal aerodromes that might become a spaceport.At the time it was thought officials would pick a ""winner"" - as if it was a competition.But ministers' views have changed. They now see the establishment of spaceports as a bottom-up process. It is up to consortia to come forward with a realistic plan that includes a practical site and a committed launch provider.Government's role is to be a regulatory facilitator and cheerleader; ministers are not interested in using substantial public funds to build spaceport infrastructure or to support launch operations. There is also a deeper, more mature understanding of how spaceports should work, says Stuart McIntyre from Orbital Access.His company, based at Prestwick Airport, is developing a satellite launch system based on a standard wide-body jet.""We would fly a carrier aircraft with a launcher out over the ocean to conduct the launch operation,"" he told BBC News. ""So clearly we would need a diversionary site if for any reason we cannot land back at the runway from which we took off. ""We therefore envisage a system of collaborating spaceports and a system of operators whose needs will describe the capabilities that are required at those spaceports. So, I would say the government's approach has matured and it's matured in a sophisticated way."""
2017-02-09,MPs urge action on green energy schemes,https://web.archive.org//web/20170210013631/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-38894030,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkMPs have said the government must do more to demonstrate the value for money of green energy schemes which are ultimately paid for by bill payers.The influential Public Accounts Committee (PAC) said it was promised in 2014 an annual report on the impact of these policies on energy bills.But it has not seen once since.The PAC also repeated previous concerns about over-optimistic forecasting in the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS).The government's Levy Control Framework is supposed to control the cost of three low-carbon generation schemes, funded by levies on energy companies, which consumers pay for through their energy bills.The PAC concluded that the framework had ""suffered from a lack of transparency, rigour and accountability"" and the forecasting of its costs had been poor. The three schemes are:The PAC said the department ""significantly underestimated"" the costs of the three framework schemes It also said the BEIS ""continues to expect to overspend the Framework budget"".Because of this, the cost of the three schemes will be £110 per household per year from 2020, £17 more than planned, according to the committee. Committee chairman Meg Hillier said: ""Bill-payers deserve to know whether or not the energy schemes they fund represent good value for money.""""The government has failed to meet its commitment to report annually on the impact these policies are having on bills. Current arrangements just aren't good enough.""Government must take action to address this and also ensure customers can see clearly what they are paying towards existing and future schemes through their bills,"" she added.The BEIS said the government would respond to the PAC's recommendations ""in due course"". However, it said it took action last year to ""revise renewable energy subsidies to ensure customers are protected from higher energy bills"". ""The strong, decisive action we took reduced projected costs by over £500m to protect people's household budgets and ensure value for money while delivering more environmentally friendly energy,"" added a BEIS spokesperson."

2017-02-09,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20170210013631/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThis article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide to the UK's vote to leave the European Union. It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 52% to 48%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%, as did Wales, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who resigned on the day after losing the referendum. Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she says she will respect the will of the people. She has said ""Brexit means Brexit"" but there is still a lot of debate about what that will mean in practice especially on the two key issues of how British firms do business in the European Union and what curbs are brought in on the rights of European Union nationals to live and work in the UK. She set out more details of her negotiating hopes in her key speech on Brexit.The UK economy appears to have weathered the initial shock of the Brexit vote, although the value of the pound remains near a 30-year low, but opinion is sharply divided over the long-term effects of leaving the EU. Some major firms such as Easyjet and John Lewis have pointed out that the slump in sterling has increased their costs. Britain also lost its top AAA credit rating, meaning the cost of government borrowing will be higher. But share prices have recovered from a dramatic slump in value, with both the FTSE 100 and the broader FTSE 250 index, which includes more British-based businesses, trading higher than before the referendum. The Bank of England cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - a record low and the first cut since 2009 - after the vote and there has not been the economic slump or recession that some had predicted. Here is a regularly updated detailed rundown of how Britain's economy is doingThe European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it has to invoke an agreement called Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May has said she intends to trigger this process by the end of March 2017, meaning the UK will be expected to have left by the summer of 2019, depending on the precise timetable agreed during the negotiations. The government will also enact a Great Repeal Bill which will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. It is expected to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove.After a court battle, the UK's Supreme Court has ruled that Parliament must be consulted before Article 50 is invoked. This is why a two line Brexit bill is currently making its way through Parliament. MPs and Lords have to vote on it.The court verdict was not what the government argued for, but ministers have insisted it will not delay their planned timetable.Most MPs are expected to vote in favour of Article 50 being triggered, although there could be attempts to amend the draft legislation.Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These men - dubbed the Three Brexiteers - will play a central role in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although it will be Mrs May, as prime minister, who will have the final say. The government did not do any emergency planning for Brexit ahead of the referendum and Mrs May has rejected calls to say what her negotiating goals are.Once Article 50 has been triggered, the UK will have two years to negotiate its withdrawal. But no one really knows how the Brexit process will work - Article 50 was only created in late 2009 and it has never been used. Former Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, now Chancellor, wanted Britain to remain in the EU, and he has suggested it could take up to six years for the UK to complete exit negotiations. The terms of Britain's exit will have to be agreed by 27 national parliaments, a process which could take some years, he has argued. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. The UK will continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making.Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Following Theresa May's Brexit recent speech we now know that the UK is not intending to stay in the EU's single market. Although there has been speculation for months about the issue, it would have meant the UK staying under the auspices of the European Court of Justice and having to allow unlimited EU immigration, under freedom of movement rules.Both sides want trade to continue after Brexit with the UK seeking a positive outcome for those who wish to trade goods and services"" - such as those in the City of London and wanting a ""comprehensive free trade deal"" giving the UK ""the greatest possible access"" to the single market. Mrs May says she wants the UK to reach a new customs union deal with the EU. A customs union is where countries agree not to impose tariffs on each others' goods and have a common tariff on goods coming in from elsewhere. The UK is currently part of the EU customs union but that stops the UK being able to do its own trade deals with other countries. Reality Check: How could customs union work?These terms have increasingly been used as debate focused on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people in order to maintain access to the EU single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result.The government has declined to give a firm guarantee about the status of EU nationals currently living in the UK, saying this is not possible without a reciprocal pledge from other EU members about the millions of British nationals living on the continent. EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, will be be able to stay, the chief civil servant at the Home Office has said. The rights of other EU nationals would be subject to negotiations on Brexit and the ""will of Parliament"", he added.A lot depends on the kind of deal the UK agrees with the EU. If it remains within the single market, it would almost certainly retain free movement rights, allowing UK citizens to work in the EU and vice versa. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.Again, it depends on whether the UK government decides to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages. Citizens' Advice has reminded people their rights have not changed yet and asked anyone to contact them if they think they have been discriminated against following the Leave vote.Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested EU migrants who come to the UK as Brexit nears may not be given the right to stay. He has said there might have to be a cut-off point if there was a ""surge"" in new arrivals.People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote.The day-to-day spending impact is likely to be more significant. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it to remain at least 10% below where it was on 23 June, in the long term. This means imported goods will consequently get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have already been seen and the issue was most notably illustrated by the dispute between Tesco and Marmite's makers about whether prices would be put up or not in the stores.The latest UK inflation figures, for December, showed the CPI inflation rate jumping to 1.6%, its highest level for two years with signs of more cost pressures set to feed through in the months to come.Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration.She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations. As mentioned above, the key issue is whether other EU nations will grant the UK access to the single market, if that is what it wants, while at the same time being allowed to restrict the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK.Mrs May has said she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. It is currently running at 330,000 a year, of which 184,000 are EU citizens, and 188,000 are from outside the EU - the figures include a 39,000 outflow of UK citizens.It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Liberal Democrats - who have just a handful of MPs - have vowed to halt Brexit and keep Britain in the EU if they were to win the next general election.Some commentators, including former House of Commons clerk Lord Lisvane, have argued that a further referendum would be needed to ratify whatever deal the UK hammers out with the EU, but there are few signs political leaders view this as a viable option.Yes. Theresa May has appeared keen to avoid a vote on her negotiating stance, to avoid having to give away her priorities, but Theresa May has said there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. It is worth mentioning that any deal also has to be agreed by the European Parliament - with British MEPs getting a chance to vote on it there.  While there could be limitations on British nationals' ability to live and work in EU countries, it seems unlikely they would want to deter tourists. There are many countries outside the European Economic Area, which includes the 28 EU nations plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway, that British citizens can visit for up to 90 days without needing a visa and it is possible that such arrangements could be negotiated with European countries.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. In theory, the government could, if it wanted, decide to change the colour, which is currently standardised for EU countries, says the BBC's Europe correspondent, Chris Morris.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketNo nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it is ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faces being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. A second independence referendum for the country is now ""highly likely"", she has said, although not in 2017. She has said she wants Scotland to stay in the single market and said Mrs May's decision to rule out the UK staying in the single market ""undoubtedly"" brings the referendum closer.Before his resignation Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said the impact in Northern Ireland would be ""very profound"" and that the whole island of Ireland should now be able to vote on reunification. But, speaking while she was still Northern Ireland Secretary, Theresa Villiers ruled out the call from Sinn Féin for a border poll, saying the circumstances in which one would be called did not exist. The land border is likely to be a key part of the Brexit talks. Theresa May said a priority for her would be negotiating a deal with the EU which allowed a common travel area between the UK and the Republic of Ireland.During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest. But his successor Theresa May has said she will keep it in place, at least for the current Parliament, which is due to last until 2020.So far there has been a cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. There are yet to be signs that rising inflation have worried the Bank of England  enough to consider raising interest rates.  But if that happened it would make mortgages and loans more expensive to repay - but would be good news for savers.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.Eurotunnel boss Jacques Gounon said last November the reintroduction of duty-free would be ""an incredible boost for my business"" but he later said  that remark had been ""light-hearted"". Erik Juul-Mortensen, president of the Tax Free World Association (TFWA) said after the referendum vote ""it is not possible to predict how Brexit will affect the duty free and travel retail industry, and it is wiser not to make assumptions about exactly what the impact will be.""  They are at the moment but no-one knows the longer term prospects for definite. The EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - is not an EU initiative. It was negotiated between countries within a group known as the European Economic Area, often simply referred to as the single market (plus Switzerland, which confusingly is not a member of the EEA, but has agreed access to the single market). Therefore, the future of Britons' EHIC cover could depend on whether the UK decided to sever ties with the EEA.Probably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report. In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two-thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.However, the UK government is committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, the UK government is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR. However, the EU has its own European Court of Justice, whose decisions are binding on EU institutions and member states.Its rulings have sometimes caused controversy in Britain and supporters of a Brexit have called for immediate legislation to curb its powers. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also cited sovereignty and democracy, and they wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Four of the biggest US banks have committed to helping maintain the City's position. But HSBC will move up to 1,000 jobs to Paris, the BBC understands. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Pest control firm Rentokil Initial says it could make £15m extra this year thanks to a weaker currency.Others are less optimistic. Hilary Jones, a director at UK cosmetics firm Lush said the company was ""terrified"" about the economic impact. She added that while the firm's Dorset factory would continue to produce goods for the UK market, products for the European market may be made at its new plant in Germany.Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After the Leave vote, the government will probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""As with most elements of the UK economy, not enough solid data has been published yet to accurately conclude the Brexit effect on house prices. Industry figures have pointed to ""uncertainty"" among buyers and sellers that could potentially change the housing market.So far, the most significant research has come from the respected Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which has published the conclusions of a survey of its members. This primarily records sentiment among surveyors.It found that house prices are expected to fall across the UK in the three months after the referendum vote. However, the dip in prices is only expected to persist over the 12 months from June in London and East Anglia, surveyors predict.House prices were already slowing in central London, owing to the fall-out from changes to stamp duty rules in April.Separate figures from property portal Rightmove suggested the average asking price of houses coming on to the market in England and Wales fell by 0.9%, or £2,647, in July compared with June. It said that agents had reported very few sales had fallen through as a result of the vote.Many potential first-time buyers would welcome a fall in house prices, with ownership among the young falling owing to affordability concerns. Investors in property, or those who have paid off a mortgage and hope to leave homes as inheritance would be unhappy with a long-term reduction in value.  Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law following the decision to leave the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" will not necessarily disappear overnight - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU means the UK will not be part of TTIP. It will have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Former Labour health secretary Lord Owen has said that because of TTIP (see answer above) the only way to protect the NHS from further privatisation was to get out of the EU."

Now Theresa May has her prize from the Commons, getting the Article 50 bill (she never wanted) through with no major changes, it makes its way to the red and gold end of the Palace of Westminster, to the Lords.The first debate is set for 20 February. More than 140 Peers have already put their names down to speak. But at that stage there probably won't be a vote. A week later the thornier more detailed committee stage begins. Then the last certain stage, the third reading and report is scheduled for 7 March. If it all goes according to the government's plan, which sources say is ""hugely unpredictable"", it would allow Theresa May to stick to her timetable and push the button for exit talks to start the next week, once the Bill has been rubber-stamped by the other Palace. (It's daft in this business to make too many predictions, but I d put a fiver on that happening on Wednesday 15 March.)The government will have a bumpier ride in the Lords after a grumpy process in the Commons. The Lords is dramatically different because the government most certainly does not have a majority among peers. And, it is the Lords' express purpose to scrutinise and if needed, improve draft laws before sending them back along the corridor to the Commons.Overnight a government source suggested that the Lords had better jolly well let the Brexit bill go through, or else. Despite the sabre-rattling though, the atmosphere in the Lords is less febrile than that language might suggest.Downing Street this morning tried to dampen down the aggressive briefing. And one source in the Lords described the threat as ""total BS"" - I'll leave you to work that out.The main opposition leader, Baroness Smith, has made it plain on several occasions that although the Lords may try to tweak the Bill, Labour, broadly, has no intention of trying to block it. Her modus operandi is to ""hold to account, not hold to ransom"".The Liberal Democrats are more intent on making changes in the Lords, for it is there they can wield power, rather than in the Commons. But unless they have the support of Labour too, there is a limit to how much trouble they can cause.The chatter suggests the Lords will push for concessions from the government over the rights of EU citizens to stay here, reporting the progress of negotiations regularly to Parliament and maybe on a final ""meaningful vote"" for both Houses on the deal.It will be up to the government to decide whether to tweak the bill slightly as they did in the Commons or risk some defeats. Insiders predict it is likely the Lords may end up sending back the bill to the Commons once, as ""ping pong"" to force the government to make a change or two. But even senior Lib Dem sources don't expect hostile stand-offs for weeks on end. The Lords will make their voices heard, there is no question about that and the Article 50 bill could run into trouble. It would be wrong to suggest that ministers don't anticipate a tricky time. But today at least, whatever the sabre-rattling from some parts of government, this historic piece of legislation looks likely to be the subject of a few skirmishes in the Lords, rather than an apocalyptic battle.

2017-02-09,Ward-by ward,https://web.archive.org//web/20170210013631/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38762034,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe BBC has obtained a more localised breakdown of votes from nearly half of the local authorities which counted EU referendum ballots last June.This information provides much greater depth and detail in explaining the pattern of how the UK voted. The key findings are:A statistical analysis of the data obtained for over a thousand individual local government wards confirms how the strength of the local Leave vote was strongly associated with lower educational qualifications.Wards where the population had fewer qualifications tended to have a higher Leave vote, as shown in the chart. If the proportion of the local electorate with a degree or similar qualification was one percentage point lower, then on average the leave vote was higher by nearly one percentage point.Using ward-level data means we can compare voting figures in this way to the local demographic information collected in the 2011 census. Of the main census statistics, this is the one with the greatest association with how people voted. In statistical terms the level of educational qualifications explains about two-thirds of the variation in the results between different wards. The correlation is strong, whether based on assessing graduate and equivalent qualifications or lower-level ones. This ward-by-ward analysis covers 1,070 individual wards in England and Wales whose boundaries had not changed since the 2011 census, about one in nine of the UK's wards. We had very little ward-level data from Scotland, and none from Northern Ireland.It should be noted, however, that many ward counts also included some postal votes from across the counting area, and therefore some variation between wards will have been masked by the random allocation of postal votes for counting. This makes the results less accurate geographically, but we can still use the information to explore broad national and local patterns.  Adding age as a second factor significantly helps to further explain voting patterns. Older populations were more likely to vote Leave. Education and age combined account for nearly 80% of the voting variation between wards. Ethnicity is a smaller factor, but one which also contributed to the results. Adding that in means that now 83% of the variation in the vote between wards is explained. White populations were generally more pro-Leave, and ethnic minorities less so.  However, there were some interesting differences between London and elsewhere.The ethnic dimension is particularly interesting when examining the outliers on the graph that compares the Leave vote to levels of education.There are numerous wards towards the bottom left of the graph where electorates with lower educational qualifications nevertheless produced low Leave and high Remain votes. This is where the link between low qualifications and Leave voting breaks down. It turns out that these exceptional wards have high ethnic minority populations, particularly in Birmingham and Haringey in north London. In contrast, there are virtually no dramatic outliers on the other side of the line, where comparatively highly educated populations voted Leave. Only one point on the graph stands out - this is Osterley and Spring Grove in Hounslow, west London, a mainly ethnic minority ward which had a Leave vote of 63%. While this figure does include some postal votes, they are not nearly enough to explain away this unusual outcome.In fact, in Ealing and Hounslow, west London boroughs with many voters of Asian origin, the ethnic correlation was in the other direction to the national picture: a higher number of Asian voters was associated with a higher Leave vote.This powerful link to educational attainment could stem from the lower qualified tending to feel less confident about their prospects and ability to compete for work in a competitive globalised economy with high levels of migration. On the other hand some commentators see it as primarily reflecting a ""culture war"" or ""values conflict"", rather than issues of economics and inequality. Research shows that non-graduates tend to take less liberal positions than graduates on a range of social issues from immigration and multi-culturalism to the death penalty.   The former campaign director of Vote Leave, Dominic Cummings, argues that the better educated are more prone to holding irrational political opinions because they are more driven by fashion and a group mentality. Of course this assessment does not imply that Leave voters were almost all poorly educated and old, and Remain voters well educated and young. The Leave side obviously attracted support from many middle class professionals, graduates and younger people. Otherwise it couldn't have won. While there was undoubtedly a lot of voting which cut across these criteria, the point of this analysis is to explore how different social groups most probably voted - and it is clear that education, age and ethnicity were crucial influences.  After these three key factors are taken into account, adding in further demographic measures from the census does little to increase the explanation of UK-wide voting patterns. However, this does not reflect the distinctively more pro-Remain voting in Scotland, since we are short of Scottish data at this geographical level. It is clear as well that in a few specific locations high student numbers were also very relevant. To a certain extent, using the level of educational qualifications as a measure combines both class and age factors, with working class and older adults both tending to be less well qualified.But the association between education and the voting results is stronger than the association between social or occupational class and the results. This is still true after taking the age of the local population into account.This suggests that voters with lower qualifications were more likely to back Leave than the better qualified, even when they were in the same social or occupational class.The existence of a significant connection between Leave voting and lower educational qualifications had already been suggested by analysis of the published referendum results from the official counting areas.The data we have obtained strengthens this conclusion, because voting patterns can now be compared to social statistics from the 2011 census at a much more detailed geographical level than by the earlier studies. The BBC analysis is also consistent with opinion polling (for example, from Lord Ashcroft, Ipsos Mori and YouGov) that tried to identify the characteristics of Leave and Remain voters.  The data we have collected can be used to illustrate the sort of places where the Leave and Remain camps did particularly well: it is hard to imagine a more glaring social contrast than that between the deprived, poorly educated housing estates of Brambles and Thorntree in Middlesbrough, and the privileged elite colleges of Market ward in central Cambridge. It is important to bear in mind, however, that most of the voting figures mentioned below also include some postal votes, so they should be treated as approximate rather than precise.  It is also important to note that the examples are limited to the places for which we were able to obtain localised information, which was only a minority of areas. The rest of the country may well contain even starker instances.Of the 1,283 individual wards for which we have data, the highest Leave vote was 82.5% in Brambles and Thorntree, a section of east Middlesbrough with many social problems. Ward boundaries have changed since the 2011 census, but in that survey the Thorntree part of the area had the lowest proportion of people with a degree or similar qualification of anywhere in England and Wales, at only 5%. And according to Middlesbrough council, the figure for the current Brambles and Thorntree ward is even lower, at just 4%. Second highest was 80.3% in Waterlees Village, a poor locality within Wisbech, Cambridgeshire. This area has seen a major influx of East European migrants who have been doing low-paid work in nearby food processing factories and farms, with tensions between them and British residents. Other wards with available data which had the strongest Leave votes were congregated in Middlesbrough, Canvey Island in Essex, Skegness in coastal Lincolnshire, and Havering in east London.The highest Remain vote was 87.8% in Market ward in central Cambridge, an area with numerous colleges and a high student population, in a city which was strongly pro-Remain.This was followed by Ashley ward  (85.6%) in central Bristol, a district featuring ethnic diversity, gentrification and alternative culture.Next highest was Northumberland Park (85.0%) in Haringey, north London, which has a substantial black population. Other wards with available data which had the strongest Remain votes were generally located in Cambridge, Bristol and the multi-ethnic London boroughs of Haringey and Lambeth. The count for Ashburton in Croydon, south London, split 50-50 exactly, with both Leave and Remain getting 3,885 votes, but that did include some postal ballots.As for being nearest to the overall result, the combined count of Tulketh and University, neighbouring wards near the centre of Preston, was 51.92% for leave, very close to the UK wide figure of 51.89%. The individual ward of Barnwood in Gloucester had Leave at 51.94%. Both figures however contain some postal votes.Given that a few councils provided even more detailed data down to the level of polling districts, it is possible to identify some very small localities that were nicely representative of the national picture. The 527 voters in the neighbouring districts of Kirk Langley and Mackworth in Amber Valley in Derbyshire, whose two ballot boxes were counted together, produced a leave proportion of 51.99%. And this figure is not contaminated by any postal votes.So journalists (or anyone else for that matter) who seek a microcosm of the UK should perhaps visit the Mundy Arms pub in Mackworth, the location for that district's polling station.Similarly, the 427 voters in the combined neighbouring polling districts of Chiddingstone Hoath and Hever Four Elms to the south of Sevenoaks in Kent delivered a leave vote of 51.6% (again, without any postal votes).The data obtained points to 269 areas of various sizes (wards, clusters of wards or constituencies) which had a different Leave/Remain outcome compared to the official counting area of which they were part.This consists of 150 areas which backed Remain but were part of Leave-voting counting areas; and 119 in the other direction. The detailed information therefore gives us an understanding of how the electorate voted which is more variegated than the officially published results.Every one of Scotland's 32 counting areas came down on the Remain side. Yet, despite the fact that most Scottish councils did not give us much detailed information, we can nevertheless identify a few smaller parts of the country which actually backed Leave.A cluster of six wards in the Banff and Buchan area in north Aberdeenshire had a strong Leave majority of 61%. There is much local discontent within the fishing industry of this coastal district about the EU's common fisheries policy.An Taobh Siar agus Nis, a ward at the northern end of the Isle of Lewis in Na h-Eileanan an Iar (Western Isles), also voted Leave, if very narrowly. And at a smaller geographical level, in Shetland the 567 voters in the combined polling districts of Whalsay and South Unst had an extremely high Leave vote of 81%. The island of Whalsay is a fishing community, where EU rules have been controversial and in 2012 numerous skippers were heavily fined for major breaches of fishing quotas.Ealing and Hounslow are neighbouring multi-ethnic boroughs in the west of London with large Asian populations, where - in contrast to the national picture - non-white ethnicity was associated with voting Leave, particularly in Ealing. Both boroughs shared a varied internal pattern of prosperous largely white areas voting strongly Remain, poorer largely white areas preferring Leave, and the Asian areas tending to be more evenly split.Ealing voted 60% Remain, with Southfield ward hitting 76%, but in contrast the Southall wards which are over 90% ethnic minority were close to 50-50.In Hounslow the richer wards in Chiswick in the east of the area voted heavily Remain (73%), but the poorer largely white wards at the opposite western end in Feltham and Bedfont voted Leave (64-66%). Osterley and Spring Grove was also 63% Leave, the highest Leave vote in any individual ward in the UK with a non-white majority for which we have data. The south London borough of Bromley narrowly voted Remain. Those parts which did not do so by a significant margin were the Cray Valley wards, largely poor white working class areas; and Biggin Hill and Darwin wards, locations to the south which contain more open countryside and lie outside the built-up commuter belt. In Croydon in south London, places which voted Leave by substantial amounts were New Addington and Fieldway, neighbouring wards with large council estates. Beyond the areas with the strongest backing for Leave and Remain, examining the detailed breakdown of votes in various places gives greater insight into the pattern of support for the two sides - as can be seen from the following examples.In several places (for example, Birmingham, Bristol, Nottingham, Portsmouth) there was a strong contrast between the Leave-voting populations of large, rundown, predominantly white, housing estates in the urban periphery, versus Remain-voting populations in inner city areas with large numbers of ethnic minorities and sometimes students.Birmingham had several wards with large Remain votes, although the city as a whole narrowly voted Leave.  These pro-Remain wards tended to be the more highly educated, better off localities, or minority ethnic areas which strongly backed Remain despite low levels of educational qualifications. I have written about this before. In Blackburn with Darwen, Bastwell ward had the highest Remain vote at 65%, compared to only 44% in the area as a whole. This ward has an ethnic minority proportion of over 90%. Other Blackburn wards which voted Remain were also ones with high minority populations.Bradford voted to Leave (54%), but the area included some starkly contrasting places which went over 60% Remain: the prosperous, genteel, spa town of Ilkley, and strongly ethnic minority wards in the city, such as Manningham and Toller.Bristol voted strongly Remain on the whole (62%), but there were some striking exceptions, particularly the large, deprived, mainly white estates to the south of the city. Hartcliffe and Withywood backed Leave at 67%. Similar neighbouring wards (Hengrove and Whitchurch Park, Filwood, Bishopsworth and Stockwood) also voted Leave, as did the more industrial area of Avonmouth and Lawrence Weston to the north west of the city.As a county Cornwall voted to Leave. But one of its six parliamentary constituencies, Truro and Falmouth, voted 53% to Remain, possibly linked to a significant student population.In Lincoln, which voted 57% to Leave, Carholme ward stands out as very different - it voted 63% to Remain. This ward includes Lincoln University, and 43% of the residents are students Middlesbrough voted 65% to Leave. As already noted, it had several wards with extremely high leave votes of over 75%. But one ward, Linthorpe, voted very narrowly to Remain - a comparatively well-to-do inner suburb which includes an art college; and another ward, Central, which contains Teesside University, nearly did. Mole Valley in Surrey exhibited a dramatic contrast between two neighbouring districts with very different demographics and housing. The highest Remain vote was in the very prosperous location of Dorking South, which voted 63% Remain, but the neighbouring ward of Holmwoods, dominated by large estates on the edge of the town of Dorking, voted 57% Leave, the area's highest Leave vote. Nottingham voted narrowly to Leave, but the inner city ward of Radford and Park voted 68% Remain. This has both a comparatively high proportion of ethnic minorities and considerable numbers of students from two nearby universities. There was a lot of variation within the area. Bulwell - a market town to the north of the city with many social problems - voted 69% Leave  There was also a high Leave vote in the housing estate locations of the Clifton wards in the south of Nottingham.Oldham voted to Leave at 61%, but Werneth, the city ward with the highest ethnic minority population, voted Remain (57%). Other wards with high minority populations also voted Remain.In Oxford the cluster of polling districts which included Blackbird Leys and other deprived estates on the southern edge of the city voted to Leave at 51%. In contrast the central areas containing colleges, university buildings and student accommodation voted to Remain at over 80%.Plymouth voted 60% Leave, but Drake ward which includes the university had the city's highest Remain vote at 56%. Portsmouth was another place with wide variation. Paulsgrove ward, with its large estate on the edge of the city, had the highest Leave vote at 70%, whereas at the other end of the spectrum Central Southsea, an inner city ward and student area, voted 57% Remain.Rochdale voted 60% Leave. The place which bucked this trend by voting 59% Remain, Milkstone and Deeplish, was the most predominantly ethnic minority ward. Central Rochdale had the second highest Remain vote and is the other ward that is mainly not white. Walsall voted strongly Leave (68%). The only ward which voted Remain, Paddock, is both a comparatively prosperous and multi-ethnic locality.A few councils released their data at remarkably localised levels, down even to individual polling districts (ie ballot boxes) in the case of Blackburn with Darwen and Bracknell Forest, or clusters of two/three/four districts, in the case of Amber Valley, Brentwood, Sevenoaks, Shetland, South Oxfordshire, and Tewkesbury.This provides very local and specific data, in some cases just for neighbourhoods of hundreds of voters.At its most detailed this reveals that the 110 people who cast their votes in the ballot box at St. Alban's Primary School in central Blackburn split 56-52 in favour of Remain, with two spoilt papers.It also discloses stark contrasts in some neighbouring locations. The 953 people who voted at Little Harwood community centre in north Blackburn had a Leave vote of only 31%, while the 336 electors who voted in the neighbouring ballot box at Roe Lee Park primary school produced a Leave percentage over twice as high, at 64%.The very detailed data we obtained also provides some rare evidence on the views of postal compared to non-postal voters. Campaign strategists have often deliberated on whether the two groups vote differently and should be given separate targeted messages.Most places mixed boxes of postal and non-postal votes for counting, so generally it's not possible to draw comparative conclusions. However there were a few exceptions which recorded them separately, or included a very small number of non-postal votes with the postals.These figures indicate that postal voters were narrowly less likely to back Leave than voters in polling stations. Data covering five counting areas with about 260,000 votes shows that in these places the roughly one in five electors who voted by post backed Leave at 55.4%, one percentage point lower than the local non-postal support for Leave of 56.4%.The counting areas involved are Amber Valley, East Cambridgeshire, Gwynedd, Hyndburn and North Warwickshire.Since the referendum the BBC has been trying to get the most detailed, localised voting data we could from each of the counting areas.  This was a major data collection exercise carried out by my colleague George Greenwood. We managed to obtain voting figures broken down into smaller geographical units for 178 of the 399 referendum counting areas (380 councils in England, Wales and Scotland, with a separate tally in Gibraltar, while in Northern Ireland results were issued for the 18 constituencies). This varied between data for individual local government wards, wards grouped into clusters, and constituency level data. In a few cases the results supplied were even more localised than ward level. Overall the extra data covers a wide range of different areas and kinds of councils across the UK. Electoral returning officers are not covered by the Freedom of Information Act, so releasing the information was up to the discretion of councils. While some were very willing, in other cases it required a lot of persistence and persuasion. Some councils could not supply any detailed data because they mixed all ballot boxes prior to counting; some did possess more local figures but simply refused to disclose them to us. Others did provide data, but the combinations in which ballot boxes were mixed before counting were too complex to fit ward boundaries neatly.A few places such as Birmingham released their ward by ward data following the referendum on their own initiative, but in most cases the information had to be obtained by us requesting it directly, and sometimes repeatedly, from the authority."

The government has now specified what would count as exceptional circumstances. It is not clear whether the new rules will be more or less strict than just letting councils decide what counted as exceptional circumstances. The government has described the housing market as broken, promised more affordable homes and said it would help people to buy and rent.A big question in discussions of increasing the supply of homes is whether planning regulations will be changed to make it easier to build on green belt land.Green belts were introduced after World War Two to stop cities from sprawling and countryside being spoilt. About 13% of England is now covered.This covers scenic sites open to the public, such as the Chiltern Hills and North Downs, but it also covers a lot of land that has limited public access and may not be particularly beautiful.In the House of Commons, Communities Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""In 2015, we promised the British people that the green belt was safe in our hands and that is still the case.""So what has changed?There has been little variation in the amount of green belt land since 1997, although data is not available for every year.The Housing White Paper says the current planning regulations allow building on the green belt only ""in exceptional circumstances"" but that there is no detail given of what would amount to exceptional circumstances.The government has now specified that before allowing development on green belt land, councils would need to rule out options including: The White Paper also says that councils allowing the boundaries of green belt land to be changed would have to make up for it by improving other bits of green belt. It also asks for suggestions of other things councils should take into account before doing so. Read more from Reality Check"
2017-02-09,Budget lookahead,https://web.archive.org//web/20170210013631/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-38891441,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkPhilip Hammond knows all about the government's attempts to ""get the public finances in order"" following the financial crisis of 2008.He was the man, as shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, credited by many for the tough detail of the austerity plan laid before voters in the run up to the 2010 election.George Osborne was the architect, Mr Hammond the foreman, ensuring there was a plan that might actually have a chance of working, public sector cut by public sector cut.Now Mr Hammond is the man in charge of the public finances - his dream government job and, a relatively rare occurrence for the resident of Number 11, said authoritatively to be the high water mark of his ambitions.Whatever his relations with the Prime Minister, and they are better than often reported, the fact that he doesn't want to move his sofas next door is a useful salve to any scratchiness between Downing Street's most important neighbours.Today sees the publication of the Institute for Fiscal Studies' (IFS) annual Green Budget, its analysis of Mr Hammond's room for manoeuvre as he prepares for the real Budget, on 8 March.There is one clear message.If you thought the era of cuts is over, think again.Day-to-day spending, officially known rather more prosaically as the Resource Departmental Expenditure Limit (which excludes investment spending), is set to fall by 4% over the next three years.The IFS says that a ""particularly sharp cut"" has been loaded onto the last year of the parliament, 2019-20, never a particularly comfortable time for a government to be squeezing the public sector pips even more aggressively.Alongside that, the IFS says the overall tax burden is set to rise as a proportion of national income to the highest level since 1986.That is not a function of actual tax rises - taxes for many millions of people have fallen as income tax thresholds have risen - but a function of a relatively high tax take throughout an era of pretty stagnant growth.Will Mr Hammond change course on 8 March, and further loosen the government's austerity strictures as he did in the Autumn Statement last year - pushing the deficit reduction target into the conveniently indistinct long grass of ""during the next parliament""?The government has, after all, promised an economy that works for all.I am told not - and that Mr Hammond is approaching his first Budget as a ""steady-as-she-goes affair"" with no major yanks on the national rudder, particularly given the economy's robust performance since the Brexit referendum.It has been pointed out to me that, just ahead of the triggering of Article 50 - the official mechanism for leaving the European Union - the last thing Britain needs is a reset of fiscal policy.In 2010, the Conservatives were elected as the party that would bring public income and public expenditure into balance.Mr Hammond still cleaves to that view. ""He is a Conservative,"" as one official close to him says.George Osborne's economic approach is alive and well. Yes, there are criticisms by some economists that there is no need to run a country like a household budget where pennies in and pennies out matter - governments are able to borrow at very cheap rates on the international markets and put that money to economically valuable use.Yes, there are criticisms that debt costs as a percentage of national income are low by historic standards and so the room for manoeuvre is rather greater than the national debt headline figures suggest.But those close to Mr Hammond argue that, OK, borrowing may be cheap now but servicing Britain's £1.7 trillion debt is still expensive, costing around £34bn a year, or 4.6% of all government spending.Cut out the deficit and start dealing with the debt and those costs can be brought down.Certainly, since the referendum, the cost of government debt has increased as rising inflation risk pushes up yields - the interest rate on government bonds issued to investors.Mr Hammond is briefing the Cabinet for the first time this week on the broad parameters of next month's Budget.He will talk about Britain's historic productivity problem and how to solve it, he will talk about skills, he will talk about research and development support and he will talk about infrastructure spending.Supporting the private economy is his priority, not reversing public sector cuts.Mr Hammond will also say that the new world of work - the gig economy - is affecting the way the Treasury has to approach complicated issues such as tax receipts as the number of self-employed - who tend to pay a lower proportion of their income to the state - grows.A lot of it will be rhetoric at this stage.For Mr Hammond wants to keep his powder dry.Dry for the bigger fiscal event of the year, the autumn Budget (as we should now call it) in November or December.As he said last year, he only wants one major tax and spend ""moment"" a year.And it's not going to be next month.

2017-02-09,Who is John Bercow?,https://web.archive.org//web/20170210013631/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38891841,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkHouse of Commons Speaker John Bercow has upset some MPs by voicing his opposition to US President Donald Trump giving an address to both Houses of Parliament. But who is the man in the big green chair?John Bercow, 54, sometimes refers to his favourite sport in the Commons chamber, recently revealing to MPs the heights of noisy passion he reaches when watching Davis Cup matches on TV. The minicab driver's son first picked up a racquet at the age of eight. He became Middlesex under-12s champion, but later suffered bronchial asthma and was a casual player only thereafter.He became a member of the Commons tennis team, forming a doubles partnership with future Prime Minister David Cameron.He even wrote a book on his top 20 male tennis players, his favourite being Switzerland's Roger Federer.It was as a schoolboy in Finchley, then the constituency of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, that Mr Bercow became involved in politics. He joined the right-wing Monday Club, but later left, describing the views of some members as ""unpalatable"".At Essex University Mr Bercow became chairman of the Federation of Conservative Students, an organisation closed down in 1986 by Conservative Party chairman Norman Tebbit because of its radical stances and sometimes raucous behaviour.Mr Bercow was elected Conservative MP for Buckingham in 1997. But in the early 2000s his political views altered. He became a champion of gay rights and said a clampdown on cannabis smokers would be ""absurd"".After entering the shadow cabinet, he called for Conservative MPs to be banned from membership of the Monday Club.Just a few minutes before he made his comments on Mr Trump on Monday, Mr Bercow announced that he was ending the requirement for Commons clerks - the advisers who sit in front of him - to wear wigs. This didn't go down too well with some MPs, who said this could undermine Parliament's standing and ignored tradition.But Mr Bercow said he wanted to make the Commons look ""marginally less stuffy and forbidding"".After becoming Speaker in 2009, he updated his own attire by wearing a business suit, rather than the knee breeches and tights worn by his predecessors.And last week he invited Conservative MP Chloe Smith to bring her baby into the chamber during a vote on Brexit.Mr Bercow has been praised for ensuring that backbench MPs get a proper chance to question ministers. He has also had run-ins with several politicians, some of whom think he is a little too fond of his own voice.Perhaps the most notorious dispute was with Conservative MP Sir Simon Burns, who in 2010 called him a ""stupid, sanctimonious dwarf"".Mr Bercow also rebuked Prime Minister David Cameron - his old tennis partner - and once cut him off mid-point at PMQs. He has turned on other ministers, including one who used his smartphone in the chamber.Some Conservatives have complained that the Speaker has not always appeared impartial.John Bercow was not a popular choice as Speaker with his fellow Conservative MPs - although it was a secret ballot the widely-held belief is that he won his 2009 election largely as a result of backing from Labour MPs. In 2015, a visibly moved Mr Bercow survived an attempt by the Leader of the House, William Hague, to remove him from office. He was applauded by opposition benches, as happened on Monday when he made his remarks about Mr Trump.After the 2015 vote, the Telegraph journalist Bobby Friedman wrote: ""The Speaker is the archetypal Marmite man, loved by some, but loathed by many others. This is not simply a matter of mild dislike or a vague irritation.""She has disappeared somewhat from public life recently, but for a while Mr Bercow's wife Sally garnered at least as many headlines as the Speaker himself.A former right-winger who moved to the Labour Party, Mrs Bercow ran unsuccessfully for Westminster Council in 2009.She appeared on Celebrity Big Brother in 2011, being the first contestant voted off the show. During the same year she appeared in the London Evening Standard, wearing only a bed sheet and proclaiming that her husband's status acted as an ""aphrodisiac"".The Bercows, who live in a flat in the Palace of Westminster, have three children."
2017-02-09,NHS week,https://web.archive.org//web/20170210013631/http://www.bbc.com/news/health-38853700,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkNo matter where you live in the UK, you will find local NHS services are under immense pressure. None of the four nations is achieving any of its three key targets for A&E, cancer or routine treatments, such as knee and hip replacements.All have developed plans and strategies to deal with the common challenges - rising demand, squeezes on funding and the ageing population. But each has found this winter to be particularly difficult. Spending: £2,057 per personKey fact: Just one hospital trust hit the four-hour A&E target in the first week of January.The system: The NHS is split between providers of services, known as NHS trusts, and commissioners, working for clinical commissioning groups. Social care, covering care homes and help in the home, is organised by councils and is means-tested.The story so far: The first week of January was the most difficult since the four-hour target was introduced in 2004. The proportion of patients being treated or discharged in time fell below 78%, with nearly half of hospitals declaring major alerts because of a shortage of beds.An estimated one in five patients ended up facing long delays for a bed after an emergency admission - double the normal rate - while ambulance crews reported problems handing over patients to A&E staff.It comes after a gradual increase in pressures in recent years. The winters have been getting progressively worst, while the 62-day target for cancer treatment to begin following an urgent GP referral has been missed for 11 months in a row. The number of people on hospital waiting lists for a routine operation has also been rising.NHS bosses set out a five-year vision for the NHS, which involved a greater emphasis on keeping people well in the community. But savings also have to be made - there is a £22bn target for 2020. This has led to the development of 44 local plans to overhaul services - some of which involve closing hospitals and cutting staff.Spending: £2,125 per personKey fact: 63% of A&E patients were seen in four hours over the Christmas period.The system: There are five integrated health and care boards that run hospitals, community services and social care. The over-75s get free care in their own home if they have high needs.The story so far: Northern Ireland has some of the worst performance figures in the UK. During the Christmas period, the number of patients seen in four hours in A&E departments dropped to 63%.Exactly the same proportion started their cancer treatment within 62 days, according to the latest statistics, while the numbers waiting longer than they should for a routine operation have almost doubled in the past four years.In response to the growing pressures, ministers have already set out a new vision for the health service, which they acknowledged was at ""breaking point"". A 10-year plan was published in the autumn, which called for greater investment in general practice as a way of coping with the rising demands on hospitals.The plan was widely criticised for its lack of detail and costings. It did not mention hospital closures, but there is a general consensus that Northern Ireland has too many small units and care would be better concentrated in fewer bigger centres.Political instability in Northern Ireland, which is facing its second assembly election in less than a year, also means the budget for the next financial year has yet to be agreed.Spending: £2,160 per personKey fact: Scotland was the last nation to hits its A&E target - in July.The system: The NHS is run by 14 health boards that organise hospital and community services. Social care is organised by councils with personal care - that is help with  washing and dressing - provided free in people's homes and residential care if an individual has high needs. The story so far: Out of all the four nations, hospitals in Scotland seem to have fared the best. Weekly data shows four-hour performance in major units hovering around the 90% mark during January.Much of the credit has been given to the way councils and the health service are working together. Budgets have been pooled, encouraging a close working relationship to help get frail patients out of hospital by providing extra rehabilitation services in the community.But most of the progress has been concentrated in and around Glasgow and Edinburgh, where over a quarter of the population lives. Arguably, this gives Scotland an advantage, as improvements in just two regions can have a significant impact on performance.In terms of cancer treatment, over 87% started treatment within 62 days, according to the latest figures, below the 95% target.Spending: £2,084 per personKey fact: 81% of patients were seen in four hours in A&E during December.The system: The NHS is run by seven health boards that organise hospital and community services. Social care is organised by councils, which cap the cost of home care at £60 a week. The story so far: NHS Wales boss Dr Andrew Goodall has described the pressures seen this winter as ""exceptional"". Some hospitals have been reporting a 10% rise in admissions compared with 12 months previously, while the ambulance services said the start of the year had been the busiest on record.The government invested an extra £50m to help hospitals deal with winter pressures and this paid for an extra 400 beds - the equivalent of one more district general hospital.But the numbers being seen in four hours during December dropped to 81% - well below the 95% target.And the numbers waiting over 12 hours nearly hit 2,500 - a rise of two-thirds on the same period the year before.Wales has become the first part of the UK to redefine how it deals with 999 calls. Instead of requiring ambulances to reach a third of calls in eight minutes, it narrowed the number of conditions needing an urgent response and now just aims for this in abut 5% of cases. Ambulance bosses say this has allowed the service to use its fleet more effectively, which means the most life-threatening cases are getting quicker treatment.Over 86% of patients given an urgent GP referral get cancer treatment within 62-days - some way short of the 95% target.Do you have a question about the NHS?

2017-02-09,Meet the EU's chief Brexit negotiator,https://web.archive.org//web/20170210013631/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37542204,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe British papers love a French villain at the heart of the EU.Is Michel Barnier about to succeed Jacques Delors as the object of their affection? The veteran Gaullist already has form.When he was Commissioner for the Internal Market and Financial Services, Mr Barnier was dubbed ""the most dangerous man in Europe"" after taking on the banking sector and championing a cap on bankers' bonuses. But while he alarmed some in the City, and will probably do so again, he also won grudging respect as a tough but even-handed negotiator.He will need all those skills and more in his new role - chief Brexit negotiator at the European Commission. And having moved seamlessly between big jobs in Paris and Brussels - French foreign minister, Commissioner, MEP - he looks well prepared. ""Don't ask me to tell you what will be at the end of the road, we haven't begun to walk yet,"" he told a conference in Brussels last month. Mr Barnier will stick closely to the official EU position of ""no negotiation without notification"" - waiting for the UK to trigger Article 50 to start the formal process of withdrawal. But he's clearly eager to get going.""I am waiting to begin,"" he said. ""I will be ready tomorrow to negotiate, frankly speaking.""And he will bring with him an instinctive pro-European agenda, and a deep knowledge of the workings of the single market.His deputy as chief Brexit negotiator is a German trade expert, Sabine Weyand, adding to the impression that Mr Barnier will lead a team that means business.One of the biggest challenges he (and his boss Jean-Claude Juncker) faces, is to ensure that representatives of the big member states don't sideline him in the Brexit divorce negotiations.But Mr Barnier's long career in French politics means he could well have the ear of the Elysee Palace, especially if - as looks likely - a centre-right candidate wins the French presidency next year. The stakes are so high that there are bound to be some clashes.Mr Barnier has sparred with the UK's Minister for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, before, when the men both served as Europe ministers in the 1990s. It is another reminder that Michel Barnier is a politician first and foremost, rather than a bureaucrat. There have certainly been criticisms - a dash of vanity, a lack of attention to detail. His career has had plenty of downs as well as ups.But he will defend his European vision to the end, and the British government would do well not to underestimate him.At the height of the eurozone crisis, Mr Barnier always refused (politely) to do broadcast interviews in English.""One wrong word,"" he told me once with a smile, ""and we could move markets.""The next few years will be equally challenging."

Scotland voted 62% in favour of Remain.The conversation online was being driven overwhelmingly by pro-independence campaigners. But people who had supported ""Better Together"" during the Scottish referendum vote also spoke about the possibility of a break-away from the UK as a result of the vote over EU membership.  Perhaps the most significant was Scottish author JK Rowling who tweeted: ""Scotland will seek independence now. Cameron's legacy will be breaking up two unions. Neither needed to happen.""Many took to Twitter to express new or strengthened pro-independence feelings in the wake of the latest vote (Just as a reminder: a ""Yes"" vote in Scotland's 2014 referendum was for independence, while the winning ""No"" campaign backed staying in the UK).One old tweet from 2014's independence referendum gained new life on Friday.

2017-02-10,Iraq war allegations probe to end,https://web.archive.org//web/20170211031622/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-38937053,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkA probe into allegations made against Iraq war veterans will be shut down within months, Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon has announced.The Iraq Historic Allegations Team (IHAT) will close in the summer and around 20 remaining cases will be given to the Royal Navy Police, he said.MPs have branded the probe, which has spent £34m but led to no successful prosecutions, an ""unmitigated failure"".The IHAT was set up in 2010 to examine allegations made by Iraqi civilians.The decision to close the team comes after a public inquiry exposed the behaviour of a human rights lawyer in charge of many of the abuse allegation cases.Phil Shiner, from the now-defunct law firm Public Interest Lawyers, was struck off for misconduct last week.As a result, IHAT's caseload would be reduced from 3,000 to 20 cases by the summer, a Ministry of Defence statement said.""Exposing his [Mr Shiner's] dishonesty means many more claims he made can now be thrown out and the beginning of the end for IHAT,"" said Sir Michael.""This will be a relief for our soldiers who have had allegations hanging over them for too long.""Now we are taking action to stop such abuse of our legal system from happening again.""Earlier on Friday, an MPs' committee called IHAT an ""unstoppable self-perpetuating machine, deaf to the concerns of the armed forces"" and said it must be shut down.More than 3,500 allegations of abuse had been taken up by the team despite many cases not having any credible evidence, said the Defence Committee report.It blamed the MoD for empowering law firms to bring cases on ""an industrial scale"" which saw cases rocket from 165 into the thousands - with most generated by two firms, Public Interest Lawyers and Leigh Day. ""Those under investigation have suffered unacceptable stress, have had their lives put on hold, and their careers damaged,"" it added.Conservative MP Johnny Mercer, a former army captain who chairs the committee, said the process had been ""horrific"" for those involved.""Families torn apart, careers ended, and for what?"" he told BBC Radio 4's PM programme. ""It should have been shut down a long time ago.""The Ministry of Defence had been ""extremely slow off the mark"", he said, and there were a lot of questions to be answered about how it had been allowed to continue for so long. The committee report said there had been a ""catalogue of serious failings"" in the way IHAT handled its investigations.Service personnel and veterans had been contacted unannounced and covert surveillance appeared to have been used on serving and retired members of the armed forces, it said.The report added: ""IHAT investigators have impersonated police officers in order to gain access to military establishments or threaten arrest. Investigations which had previously been closed down were re-opened on the back of dubious evidence.""It said the most telling failure of the unit was the fact there had not been a single prosecution against the UK military.The report went on: ""IHAT has operated without any regard to its impact on the UK military which has directly harmed their reputation across the world, and negatively affected the way this country conducts military operations and defends itself.""The MoD said the department had done its ""utmost"" to support those under investigation, which included funding all their legal costs, providing pastoral support and tackling issues in the legal process.It had been unable to shut down IHAT sooner because the investigations had been under scrutiny by the High Court and the International Criminal Court, it added.A Leigh Day spokesman said it had referred 15 cases to IHAT and would continue to represent individuals against the government.The firm went on to say it would defend itself against allegations made by the Solicitors Regulation Authority when they are heard in a tribunal later in the year.The unit has cost the UK taxpayer £34m so far, but costs were predicted to reach nearly £60m had it remained active until 2019.The department also announced the Royal Military Police would drop around 90% of the abuse cases involving British troops who had served in Afghanistan, many which were brought by Leigh Day.Leigh Day said it had notified the MoD of 80 Afghan citizens who said they had been abused or illegally detained and a number involved allegations of unlawful killings."
2017-02-10,"NHS problems unacceptable, says Hunt",https://web.archive.org//web/20170211031622/http://www.bbc.com/news/health-38926697,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkHealth Secretary Jeremy Hunt has conceded the NHS in England is facing ""completely unacceptable"" problems.He said there was ""no excuse"" for some of the difficulties highlighted during the BBC's NHS week and the government had a plan to help hospitals cope.A series of reports has revealed lengthening waits in A&E and patients being left for hours on trolleys.Sir Robert Francis QC, who investigated failings in Mid Staffordshire, said the NHS was facing an ""existential crisis"".However, in an exclusive interview with the BBC, Mr Hunt said the key was to treat more people ""at home and in the community"" to ease the burden on hard-pressed hospitals.He said there was already a ""big transformation programme"" under way, but conceded it would take time.Mr Hunt was speaking at the end of a week in which the BBC has revealed:He said: ""It is incredibly frustrating for me. I am doing this job because I want NHS care to be the safest and best in the world. That kind of care is completely unacceptable. No-one would want it for members of their own family.""He said there were ""no excuses"" for some of the stories that have emerged this week, including the case of Iris Sibley, who has been left stranded in Bristol Royal Infirmary for more than six months because a nursing home place could not be found for her.""It is terrible for Mrs Sibley but it is also very bad for the NHS,"" Mr Hunt said.He went on to say it was ""completely unacceptable"" - the third time he used the phrase when pressed by the BBC about some of the problems that have come to light.Mr Hunt said: ""We are trying very hard to sort out these problems.""But he admitted progress had been ""disappointingly slow"" in some areas, including integrating the NHS with council-run care services, such as care homes and home help.However, he added: ""Where I disagree with some of your coverage is the idea this is a problem unique to the NHS.""He claimed all health systems were ""grappling"" with similar problems because of the ageing population. ""There's no silver bullet,"" he added.He also took issue with suggestions that it was all about money, pointing out France and Germany, who both spend more than the UK on health, did not do as well as the NHS on 14 out of 35 measures.He said France had struggled this winter with flu, while some German cities had been forced to close their A&Es on ""certain nights"".Mr Hunt said in England extra money was being put in - nearly £4bn this year, which he pointed out was the equivalent to the whole budget of the fire service.While this represents an increase in the front-line budget of nearly 4% this year, since 2010 the NHS has had much less generous rises than it has traditionally enjoyed. That trend is forecast to continue until 2020.He said tackling social care problems - a major reason why so many frail patients cannot be discharged from hospital - was on the government's agenda.""The prime minister has been very clear. We recognise the pressure's there. We recognise there is a problem about the sustainability of the social care system.""That has to be addressed and we are going to do that.""Mr Hunt also said there were ""positive"" things happening in the health service as well as negative, highlighting improvements in cancer survival and the investment being made in general practice.However, Sir Robert Francis said the financial pressures on the NHS - together with the high levels of demand - had created an environment in which a care scandal equal to Mid Staffordshire was ""inevitable"".The health service was ""manifestly failing"" to keep pace with demand, he told the Health Service Journal. Sir Robert, who is a non-executive director at the Care Quality Commission, also warned of ""depressingly familiar"" pressures on NHS chief executives ""coming down from the top.""He said there was an ""increasing disconnect"" between what was said nationally about the NHS and ""what people on the ground feel or see is going on"".""The message is put out that we are putting more money into the service than we ever did and it is the best health service around.""But against that there is a front-line feeling that things have never been as bad as they are now and we can't deal with the pressures,"" he added.Labour Shadow Health Secretary Jon Ashworth said: ""A few weeks ago the prime minister was glibly dismissing concerns as amounting to nothing more than a 'small number of incidents'. ""I'm pleased the secretary of state is waking up to the scale of the crisis.""He urged the government to make more money available to put the NHS and social care on a ""sustainable footing"".Read more from NickFollow Nick on TwitterA week of coverage by BBC News examining the state of the NHS across the UK as it comes under intense pressure during its busiest time of the year."

2017-02-10,Child protection opt-outs 'dangerous',https://web.archive.org//web/20170211031622/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-38933234,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkPlans to allow councils to opt out of key legal duties to vulnerable children have been labelled a ""serious danger"" by a former government adviser.Prof Eileen Munro, whose social work review inspired the Children and Social Work Bill, said the opt-outs create ""more dangers than benefits"".Under the bill, children's rights and checks on care could be set aside by councils trying new ways of working.Ministers said it was wrong to say that children would be at risk as a result.Instead they argue the Bill is a bold approach to removing red tape and allowing innovative ways of working. The Bill, which is going through Parliament, has been described as ""a bonfire of child protection rights"", with many campaigners arguing that to allow councils to opt out of these long-standing duties would be risky and unnecessary.If it becomes law, local authorities would be able to apply to the secretary of state to be exempted from one or more legal duties for a period of three years so it could try out new ways of working.This could then be extended for a further three years.Ministers have regularly cited Prof Munro as a supporter of what the government refers to as ""innovation powers"", referring to a statement issued last year in which she supported the plans. However, the professor of social policy has now signalled her opposition to the Bill in an email to children's rights campaign group Article 39.""I have reached the conclusion that the power to have exemption from primary and secondary legislation creates more dangers than the benefits it might produce,"" she said.""While I understand and respect the motivation of the current government, there is a serious danger in having such wide-reaching powers in statute.  ""Some future secretary of state might use them in ways that are completely contrary to the current intentions and consequently subvert the will of Parliament.""The legal duties affected by the Bill relate to nearly all the social care services children receive from local authorities, which have been laid down in numerous acts of Parliament.These include statutory rights on child protection, family support, children's homes and fostering, support to care leavers and services for disabled children.About 50 organisations publicly oppose the proposed exemptions, including the British Association of Social Workers, the Care Leavers' Association, Women's Aid, Liberty and the National Association of People Abused in Childhood.Article 39 director Carolyne Willow said: ""The death knell has finally sounded for this appalling attack on children's law and parliamentary sovereignty.""From the start, ministers claimed their dangerous plan to test out the removal of legal protection from vulnerable children and young people had the backing of Prof Munro. Well now she has walked away. ""Peers rejected these clauses, more than 50 organisations oppose them, social workers and others with long careers helping children reject them and more than 107,000 members of the public have signed a petition against them. ""Nobody wants our child protection and welfare system to lose its legal infrastructure.""Ministers must do the decent thing for children and young people and withdraw these hated clauses.""A Department for Education spokeswoman said: ""We know that over-regulation can get in the way of good social work practice, and the power to innovate will allow local authorities to test new approaches in a carefully controlled and monitored way. ""We have amended these clauses to strengthen the safeguards - to suggest the power to innovate would place children at risk is simply wrong.""   "

It is hoped 5,700 pupils aged 14 and over will spend up to four hours a week on the subject in a five-year pilot.Classroom and online teaching, ""real-world challenges"" and work experience will be made available from September. A Commons committee last week warned that a skills shortage was undermining confidence in the UK's cyber defences.  The risk that criminals or foreign powers might hack into critical UK computer systems is now ranked as one of the top four threats to national security.  Russia in particular is suspected of planning sustained attacks on Western targets. Cyber security is a fast-growing industry, employing 58,000 experts, the government says, but the Public Accounts Committee has warned it is proving difficult to recruit people with the right skills.  UK's cyber security defences questionedRussian hacks 'aim to destabilise the West'The Department for Culture, Media and Sport is providing £20m for the new lessons, which will be designed to fit around pupils' current courses and exams.Digital and Culture Minister Matt Hancock said: ""This forward-thinking programme will see thousands of the best and brightest young minds given the opportunity to learn cutting-edge cyber security skills alongside their secondary school studies. ""We are determined to prepare Britain for the challenges it faces now and in the future and these extra-curricular clubs will help identify and inspire future talent.""The government is already providing university funding and work placements for promising students.An apprenticeship scheme has also begun to support key employers to train and recruit young people aged 16 or over who have a ""natural flair for problem-solving"" and are ""passionate about technology"".Mr Hancock told the BBC he wanted to ensure the UK ""had the pipeline of talent"" it would need."
2017-02-10,Council tax bills set to rise in England,https://web.archive.org//web/20170211031622/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38929869,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkScores of local authorities in England plan to increase council tax by up to 5% in 2017-8, according to research. The Local Government Information Unit said 94% of the 131 councils it spoke to were intending to put up bills, with their finances at ""breaking point"". A third of these, 34% in total, intend to hike bills by more than 2% in April. Councils, many of whom have frozen bills in recent years, say it will not be enough to plug the funding ""gap"" exacerbated by the cost of social care.But the government says council tax is expected to be lower in real terms at the end of this Parliament than it was in 2010.Although councils in Wales were included in the survey, the Welsh government has said it will not allow councils to raise bills to pay for social care. Ministers say they are bringing forward money to help councils pay for social care by increasing the ""precept"" - a supplement that councils are able to charge on bills - from 2% to 5% over the next two years. Years of cuts to central government funding since 2011 have put pressure on the budgets of the 375 councils in England and Wales, with many paring back core services. Financial pressures on county councils and unitary authorities that provide adult social care have become particularly acute in the past year.Surrey County Council abandoned controversial plans this week to hold a referendum on a 15% rise in council tax which it said was needed to pay for social care. It will now increase bills by 4.99% - the maximum it can do without holding a public vote.Labour have accused the government of doing a sweetheart deal with the Tory-controlled council to call off the referendum - claims it denies.Publishing its research, the Local Government Information Unit said five district councils which do not provide social care had wanted to hold local referendums to sanction council tax rises above 2% but had ""thought better"" of it in recent weeks.Inflation, as measured by the CPI index, currently stands at 1.6% but is projected to rise to 2.7% next year. The LGIU said there was growing concern in town halls that the current system of funding local authorities - through a mixture of government grants, council tax and other income streams such as business rates and parking charges - would become unsustainable in the near future.Of the 163 council chiefs - across 131 local authorities - which responded to its survey, 42% said future cuts would be ""noticed"" by residents while one in 10 feared the situation might become so serious that they would no longer be able to fulfil their councils' legal obligations to provide certain services. A number of county councils - including Newcastle, North Tyneside, South Tyneside and Sunderland - have already said they will add the full 3% ""social care precept"" to council tax bills next year and many others are expected to follow suit. Jonathan Carr-West, chief executive of the LGIU, said: ""Local government finances are at breaking point.""""We see councils around the country patching their budgets by raising council tax, drawing on their reserves and increasing charging. They have very little confidence in the sustainability of the system.""Councils are allowed to place a 3% precept on council tax to fund adult social care - nine out of 10 of them saying it is not enough money and won't meet the gap. Councils are going to retain 100% of the new business rates - half of councils tell us they think they will be worse off under that new system post-2020.""He said councils were being frustrated in their efforts to address the problems themselves with revenue-raising measures such as greater scope for charging, local hotel taxes and a re-evaluation of council tax bands ""off the government's agenda"".""None of these are wild and wacky ideas. They are things that are done in other countries, in the US, France and Spain and they work. ""Here they are not even part of the conversation. That needs to change.""A spokesman for the Department of Communities and Local Government said: ""Council tax is expected to be lower in real terms at the end of this Parliament than it was in 2010 and we've protected residents by allowing them to veto excessive rises at a local referendum.""Our historic four-year funding settlement gives local authorities the certainty they need to plan ahead, with almost £200bn available to provide the services that local people most value. ""We've also announced an additional £900m for social care, meaning councils will have £7.6bn of dedicated funding to spend over the four years."" "

The legal action by the charity Help Refugees, begun before the government's announcement on Wednesday, argues that ministers have failed to work hard enough to find sufficient places for the children.Campaigners say the consultation process by which the Home Secretary Amber Rudd decided only 350 would be accepted was ""fundamentally flawed"".At a preliminary hearing in London on Friday, Mr Justice Holman said he was ""determined"" the case should move forward quickly and a provisional date for a full hearing was set for May.Meanwhile, the daughter of the man called ""Britain's Schindler"" has criticised the ending of the Dubs scheme.Barbara Winton, daughter of Sir Nicholas Winton - who helped save hundreds of children from the Nazis in World War Two - has called on the prime minister to reinstate the Dubs amendment.In a letter to Theresa May, she said her father had said the UK had ""a responsibility to offer sanctuary to those fleeing persecution"".Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, she said she wanted to ""remind"" the prime minister of the words Mrs May had used at a memorial to Sir Nicholas, that she hoped his life would ""encourage us to do the right thing"".Ms Winton said children in migrant camps in Europe were ""suffering really difficult situations"" and were alone.""I would say that rather than honouring what my father did 80 years ago by just talking about that, the best way to honour him is to do what he would do now and that is help as many children as possible,"" she added. Ministers say 350 children will have arrived under the scheme by the time it ends in March, but have highlighted fears that it encourages people traffickers.Lord Dubs and his supporters have suggested the UK could help 3,000 of the most vulnerable children.On Thursday, church leaders, charities, MPs and peers also condemned the decision to close the scheme.Lord Dubs said: ""I believe, in arbitrarily closing down the scheme without any good reason for doing so, the government is in breach of its own commitments.""Home Secretary Amber Rudd defended the approach to the Dubs scheme - saying UK and French authorities feared it had provided opportunities for people traffickers.Speaking in the Commons, she said: ""I am clear that when working with my French counterparts they do not want us to indefinitely continue to accept children under the Dubs amendment because they specify, and I agree with them, that it acts as a draw.""It acts as a pull. It encourages the people traffickers.""The Home Office has insisted it is not giving up on vulnerable children and youngsters will continue to arrive from around the world through other resettlement schemes and the asylum system."

and rare - insight into Germany's approach as Britain starts the process of leaving the European Union.And that approach is hawkish.""The current model of using London as a gateway to Europe is likely to end,"" Mr Dombret said at the closed-door event.Mr Dombret made it clear that he did not support a ""confrontational approach"" to future relations between the UK's substantial financial services sector and the EU.But he argued there was ""intense uncertainty"" about how the Brexit negotiations would progress and significant hurdles to overcome.The Bundesbank executive, who is responsible for banking and financial supervision, said he was concerned that the trend towards internationally agreed standards was under pressure.And that Britain might try to become the ""Singapore of Europe"" following Brexit, by cutting taxes and relaxing financial regulations to encourage banks and businesses to invest in the UK.""Brexit fits into a certain trend we are seeing towards renationalisation,"" he said.""I strongly believe that this negatively affects the well-being of us all.""We should therefore invest all our efforts in containing these trends.""This holds for the private sector as well as for supervisors and policymakers in the EU and the UK.""Some voices are calling for deregulation after Brexit,"" he continued.""One such example is the 'financial centre strategy' that is being discussed as a fallback option for the City of London.""Parts of this recipe are low corporate taxes and loose financial regulation.""We should not forget that strictly supervised and well-capitalised financial systems are the most successful ones in the long run.""The EU will not engage in a regulatory race to the bottom.""At present, London operates as the financial services capital for the EU.More than a third of all wholesale banking between larger businesses, governments and pension funds takes place in Britain.Nearly 80% of all foreign exchange transactions in the EU are carried out in the UK.The business is valued in trillions of pounds, with billions of pounds being traded every day to insure companies, for example, against interest rate changes, currency fluctuations and inflation risk.If there were significant changes to the present free-trading relationship between Britain and the EU, that could have a major impact on the value of the financial services to the UK and on the one million people employed in the sector.Mr Dombret said it would also have an impact on German businesses which use London as a source of funding.Some banks are hoping that, with the government looking to fully leave the single market, an ""equivalence regime"" can be agreed where the UK and the EU recognise each other's regulatory standards.That would allow cross-border transactions to continue with few regulatory hurdles.But Mr Dombret said that equivalence had ""major drawbacks"" and was not an ""ideal substitute"".""I am very sceptical about whether equivalence decisions offer a sound footing for banks' long-term location decisions,"" he said.""Equivalence is miles away from single market access.""Equivalence decisions are reversible, so banks would be forced to adjust to a new environment in the event that supervisory frameworks are no longer deemed equivalent.""These lead to the overall conclusion that equivalence decisions are no ideal substitute for passporting [which allows banks in one EU country to operate in another as part of the single market].""Whatever the arrangements, Mr Dombret said that a ""transition period"" would ease the pressure of change and reduce what he described as the ""earnings risk"".""Let me say that I expect London to remain an important financial centre,"" Mr Dombret told the audience.""Nevertheless, I also expect many UK-based market participants to move at least some business units to the EU in order to hedge against all possible outcomes of the negotiations.""One of the biggest EU-focused businesses in the UK is euro-denominated clearing - insurance products called derivatives, which allow companies to protect themselves from movements in currencies, interest rates and inflation.Three-quarters of the multi-trillion-pounds-a-day market is executed in London and a recent report from the accountancy firm EY estimated that nearly 83,000 jobs could be lost in Britain over the next seven years if clearing has to move to an EU member state following Brexit.Mr Dombret said it was difficult to see how euro-clearing could remain in London, as it depended on the ""acceptance of the European Court of Justice"" as the arbiter of the thousands of legal contracts signed between counter-parties, many of which last for years.Britain has made it clear that it does not want to be bound by ECJ judgements once it has left the EU.""I see strong arguments for having the bulk of the clearing business inside the euro area,"" Mr Dombret said."

Ms Long-Bailey, MP for Salford and Eccles, was previously shadow chief secretary to the Treasury and was described by Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell as a ""brilliant"" member of the ""next generation of our socialist leadership team"" last week. Ms Hayman, MP for Workington in West Cumbria, was a shadow environment minister before her promotion, while Ms Rees, MP for Neath, was a shadow justice minister. Mr Dowd is MP for Bootle.Ms Rees and Ms Hayman both nominated Owen Smith in his unsuccessful challenge to Mr Corbyn's leadership in 2016.There are now 14 women in Mr Corbyn's 29-member shadow cabinet.The Labour Party said that more junior shadow ministerial roles would be filled ""in due course"".What is striking about this announcement is not who has been appointed, and to which job - it is the leadership's approach to the frontbenchers among the 52 Labour rebels who defied Jeremy Corbyn in last night's vote on Brexit. Most of them tonight are still in a job, despite abandoning the collective responsibility of the party's official position and ignoring their leader. I understand it's unlikely there will be any sackings. This in itself is extraordinary, not least because among the rebels were three whips, the very people responsible for party discipline. It illustrates what you might call Jeremy Corbyn's human resources challenge. When you discount those who won't serve under him, and those who have but no longer do, his options are limited.Mr Lewis announced his resignation from the party's front bench as MPs began voting for the final time on the Brexit bill on Wednesday.In a letter to Mr Corbyn, he wrote that he was leaving the shadow cabinet ""with a very heavy heart"", but Labour had not won ""the protections the people of this country need"" during the Commons debates on Brexit.Asked on the BBC about Mr Lewis's departure, Mr Corbyn said: ""It's not a disaster. ""The majority of Labour MPs voted to trigger Article 50. Fifty-odd voted against it, mainly on the basis of their strong message from their own constituents.""Labour's chief whip Nick Brown will handle any disciplinary action to be taken against the 52 Labour MPs who rebelled against the party line and voted against the Brexit bill on Wednesday."

2017-02-10,Farm subsidy delays 'raise Brexit fears',https://web.archive.org//web/20170211031622/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38923450,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe government's failure to pay EU subsidies on time or help farmers hit hard by delays raises doubts about its ability to cope with Brexit, MPs say.Delays to Common Agricultural Policy payments meant some farmers had to sell livestock to pay bills, they say.Only 38% of England's farmers were paid on the first day possible in 2015 - in other years it had been more than 90%.The government said major progress had since been made and it had met its 2017 target to pay 93% of farmers by March.On 1 January 2015, the Common Agricultural Policy Basic Payment Scheme replaced the previous Single Payment Scheme - bringing with it new requirements. The Rural Payments Agency, which distributes EU funds to farmers, went from an ""all time high"" - paying out 95% of farmers on day one of the scheme in December 2014 - to paying out just 38% of farmers on 1 December 2015.By the end of March 2016, only 84% of farmers had been paid - meaning some 14,300 farmers had received no payment. Some were still owed more than 1,000 euros (£850) nine months after they could first have been paid.Delays were blamed on changes to the CAP scheme and a problematic IT system. Applications had to be processed on paper, because an online application system was not ready, which ""introduced a significant amount of errors... despite farmers submitting appropriate evidence"".And new requirements under the CAP meant the agency did not hold the more detailed level of information about what type of land farmers had.Payments made to flood-affected farmers in North Yorkshire and Cumbria had also ""lagged behind the rest of England until June 2016"", the MPs said.The Public Accounts Committee report said: ""The department's record of failure when developing systems to support subsidy payments to farmers does not inspire confidence in its ability to cope with the challenges associated with Brexit that lie ahead.""It called on the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to use better data and to make sure ""accurate, full payments are made in a timely manner"".The committee heard that some farmers had needed to take out bank loans or sell livestock to cover their costs because payments had been delayed. The government was also criticised for the high number of ""disallowance penalties"" - fines imposed by the European Commission for late or inaccurate payments or other failures to meet the rules.  England has already incurred £642m in the penalties - about 2.98% of the total value of payments made since 2005, the fourth highest in the EU. The committee's deputy chairman, Richard Bacon, described the late payment of subsidies as ""a sorry affair"".He said: ""Farmers have suffered badly from the collapse in service levels, and government has done too little to help them cope with the fallout.""EU subsidies account for about 50% of British farm incomes. The government has promised to match EU subsidies until 2020. Mr Bacon added: ""If farmers are to be properly supported through Brexit and beyond, it is vital their interests are represented at senior level. ""In particular, the RPA must be at the table during discussions of any future subsidy payment scheme.""A Defra spokesman said: ""The Common Agricultural Policy is a complex and bureaucratic scheme. ""The UK government is working to improve the system and ensure farmers get the support they are entitled to. ""We have made major progress - this year the Rural Payments Agency has already met its target to pay 93% of farmers by March 2017, and it is working hard to get outstanding payments into bank accounts.""We are leaving the European Union. ""This represents one of many opportunities to design a better system which supports farmers and our agricultural economy, and cut unnecessary red tape."""
2017-02-10,MP launches bid to oust Speaker Bercow,https://web.archive.org//web/20170211031622/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38923451,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkA Conservative MP is hoping to increase pressure on Commons Speaker John Bercow by tabling a no-confidence motion.Mr Bercow said this week he would be ""strongly opposed"" to US President Donald Trump addressing Parliament, accusing him of ""racism and sexism"". James Duddridge said Mr Bercow had ""overstepped the mark"" although he did not expect his motion to be debated.The Speaker is the highest authority of the House of Commons and is expected to remain politically impartial.Who is John Bercow?Mr Duddridge told the BBC: ""I've done this because Speaker Bercow for a long time has been overstepping the mark and with his comments on the state visit [of President Trump] he has clearly expressed views.""That is not the role of the Speaker, and it is impossible for him to chair debates as Speaker adjudicating on things he has expressed a view on.""I've tabled a motion to the House of Commons. I expect over the week of recess for people to be supporting that but they can't actually sign it until the first day back. ""But to be frank, I think there's a very real possibility that once the level of discontent is known and Speaker Bercow sees the writing is on the wall he will go of his own accord.""BBC Parliamentary correspondent Mark D'Arcy said other senior backbenchers doubt that Mr Duddridge's tactics would work.He said Mr Bercow has a reservoir of support on the backbenches - particularly among pro-Brexit Conservative backbenchers - and was seen to have enabled MPs to challenge the government far more effectively. Mr Duddridge, Conservative MP for Rochford and Southend East, had already written to the prime minister, asking for MPs to be given a free vote if there was a vote of no confidence in the Speaker.Conservative MP Alec Shelbrooke tweeted on Thursday that he disagreed with President Trump's executive order barring migrants from seven countries but added: ""John Bercow has politicised the office of Speaker and his position is untenable.""But fellow Conservative Claire Perry said on BBC One's Question Time: ""I think for us to try and remove a speaker over something that he said would be really rather drastic. He's entitled to his opinions, perhaps he just shouldn't have addressed them on this particular issue.""Meanwhile an early day motion calling for officials to withhold permission for Mr Trump to address Parliament, has now been signed by 204 MPs - largely from the Labour Party.That motion was sponsored by the Labour MP Stephen Doughty - whose point of order about it on Monday prompted Mr Bercow's initial comments.President Trump has accepted an invitation from the Queen for a state visit to the UK, which can include an address to both Houses of Parliament, later this year.However, responding to a point of order in the Commons on Monday, Mr Bercow said he was opposed to Mr Trump speaking to MPs and peers saying it was ""not an automatic right"", but an ""earned honour"", to applause from Labour and SNP MPs.He has since said it was time ""to move on to other matters"".In March 2015 a bid to change the rules on electing Commons speakers - which was seen by some as a bid by the Tory leadership to oust Mr Bercow - was defeated by 228 votes to 202. Mr Bercow is one of three ""key holders"" to Westminster Hall - where Mr Trump's predecessor Barack Obama spoke in 2011 - along with the Speaker of the House of Lords, Lord Fowler, and the Lord Great Chamberlain, a hereditary peer in charge of certain parts of the Palace of Westminster. All three must agree in order for an address to take place there. No date for Mr Trump's visit has been announced. "

2017-02-10,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20170211031622/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThis article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide to the UK's vote to leave the European Union. It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 52% to 48%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%, as did Wales, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who resigned on the day after losing the referendum. Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she says she will respect the will of the people. She has said ""Brexit means Brexit"" but there is still a lot of debate about what that will mean in practice especially on the two key issues of how British firms do business in the European Union and what curbs are brought in on the rights of European Union nationals to live and work in the UK. She set out more details of her negotiating hopes in her key speech on Brexit.The UK economy appears to have weathered the initial shock of the Brexit vote, although the value of the pound remains near a 30-year low, but opinion is sharply divided over the long-term effects of leaving the EU. Some major firms such as Easyjet and John Lewis have pointed out that the slump in sterling has increased their costs. Britain also lost its top AAA credit rating, meaning the cost of government borrowing will be higher. But share prices have recovered from a dramatic slump in value, with both the FTSE 100 and the broader FTSE 250 index, which includes more British-based businesses, trading higher than before the referendum. The Bank of England cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - a record low and the first cut since 2009 - after the vote and there has not been the economic slump or recession that some had predicted. Here is a regularly updated detailed rundown of how Britain's economy is doingThe European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it has to invoke an agreement called Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May has said she intends to trigger this process by the end of March 2017, meaning the UK will be expected to have left by the summer of 2019, depending on the precise timetable agreed during the negotiations. The government will also enact a Great Repeal Bill which will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. It is expected to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove.After a court battle, the UK's Supreme Court has ruled that Parliament must be consulted before Article 50 is invoked. This is why a two line Brexit bill is currently making its way through Parliament. MPs and Lords have to vote on it.The court verdict was not what the government argued for, but ministers have insisted it will not delay their planned timetable.Most MPs are expected to vote in favour of Article 50 being triggered, although there could be attempts to amend the draft legislation.Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These men - dubbed the Three Brexiteers - will play a central role in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although it will be Mrs May, as prime minister, who will have the final say. The government did not do any emergency planning for Brexit ahead of the referendum and Mrs May has rejected calls to say what her negotiating goals are.Once Article 50 has been triggered, the UK will have two years to negotiate its withdrawal. But no one really knows how the Brexit process will work - Article 50 was only created in late 2009 and it has never been used. Former Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, now Chancellor, wanted Britain to remain in the EU, and he has suggested it could take up to six years for the UK to complete exit negotiations. The terms of Britain's exit will have to be agreed by 27 national parliaments, a process which could take some years, he has argued. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. The UK will continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making.Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Following Theresa May's Brexit recent speech we now know that the UK is not intending to stay in the EU's single market. Although there has been speculation for months about the issue, it would have meant the UK staying under the auspices of the European Court of Justice and having to allow unlimited EU immigration, under freedom of movement rules.Both sides want trade to continue after Brexit with the UK seeking a positive outcome for those who wish to trade goods and services"" - such as those in the City of London and wanting a ""comprehensive free trade deal"" giving the UK ""the greatest possible access"" to the single market. Mrs May says she wants the UK to reach a new customs union deal with the EU. A customs union is where countries agree not to impose tariffs on each others' goods and have a common tariff on goods coming in from elsewhere. The UK is currently part of the EU customs union but that stops the UK being able to do its own trade deals with other countries. Reality Check: How could customs union work?These terms have increasingly been used as debate focused on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people in order to maintain access to the EU single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result.The government has declined to give a firm guarantee about the status of EU nationals currently living in the UK, saying this is not possible without a reciprocal pledge from other EU members about the millions of British nationals living on the continent. EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, will be be able to stay, the chief civil servant at the Home Office has said. The rights of other EU nationals would be subject to negotiations on Brexit and the ""will of Parliament"", he added.A lot depends on the kind of deal the UK agrees with the EU. If it remains within the single market, it would almost certainly retain free movement rights, allowing UK citizens to work in the EU and vice versa. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.Again, it depends on whether the UK government decides to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages. Citizens' Advice has reminded people their rights have not changed yet and asked anyone to contact them if they think they have been discriminated against following the Leave vote.Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested EU migrants who come to the UK as Brexit nears may not be given the right to stay. He has said there might have to be a cut-off point if there was a ""surge"" in new arrivals.People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote.The day-to-day spending impact is likely to be more significant. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it to remain at least 10% below where it was on 23 June, in the long term. This means imported goods will consequently get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have already been seen and the issue was most notably illustrated by the dispute between Tesco and Marmite's makers about whether prices would be put up or not in the stores.The latest UK inflation figures, for December, showed the CPI inflation rate jumping to 1.6%, its highest level for two years with signs of more cost pressures set to feed through in the months to come.Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration.She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations. As mentioned above, the key issue is whether other EU nations will grant the UK access to the single market, if that is what it wants, while at the same time being allowed to restrict the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK.Mrs May has said she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. It is currently running at 330,000 a year, of which 184,000 are EU citizens, and 188,000 are from outside the EU - the figures include a 39,000 outflow of UK citizens.It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Liberal Democrats - who have just a handful of MPs - have vowed to halt Brexit and keep Britain in the EU if they were to win the next general election.Some commentators, including former House of Commons clerk Lord Lisvane, have argued that a further referendum would be needed to ratify whatever deal the UK hammers out with the EU, but there are few signs political leaders view this as a viable option.Yes. Theresa May has appeared keen to avoid a vote on her negotiating stance, to avoid having to give away her priorities, but Theresa May has said there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. It is worth mentioning that any deal also has to be agreed by the European Parliament - with British MEPs getting a chance to vote on it there.  While there could be limitations on British nationals' ability to live and work in EU countries, it seems unlikely they would want to deter tourists. There are many countries outside the European Economic Area, which includes the 28 EU nations plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway, that British citizens can visit for up to 90 days without needing a visa and it is possible that such arrangements could be negotiated with European countries.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. In theory, the government could, if it wanted, decide to change the colour, which is currently standardised for EU countries, says the BBC's Europe correspondent, Chris Morris.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketNo nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it is ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faces being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. A second independence referendum for the country is now ""highly likely"", she has said, although not in 2017. She has said she wants Scotland to stay in the single market and said Mrs May's decision to rule out the UK staying in the single market ""undoubtedly"" brings the referendum closer.Before his resignation Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said the impact in Northern Ireland would be ""very profound"" and that the whole island of Ireland should now be able to vote on reunification. But, speaking while she was still Northern Ireland Secretary, Theresa Villiers ruled out the call from Sinn Féin for a border poll, saying the circumstances in which one would be called did not exist. The land border is likely to be a key part of the Brexit talks. Theresa May said a priority for her would be negotiating a deal with the EU which allowed a common travel area between the UK and the Republic of Ireland.During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest. But his successor Theresa May has said she will keep it in place, at least for the current Parliament, which is due to last until 2020.So far there has been a cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. There are yet to be signs that rising inflation have worried the Bank of England  enough to consider raising interest rates.  But if that happened it would make mortgages and loans more expensive to repay - but would be good news for savers.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.Eurotunnel boss Jacques Gounon said last November the reintroduction of duty-free would be ""an incredible boost for my business"" but he later said  that remark had been ""light-hearted"". Erik Juul-Mortensen, president of the Tax Free World Association (TFWA) said after the referendum vote ""it is not possible to predict how Brexit will affect the duty free and travel retail industry, and it is wiser not to make assumptions about exactly what the impact will be.""  They are at the moment but no-one knows the longer term prospects for definite. The EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - is not an EU initiative. It was negotiated between countries within a group known as the European Economic Area, often simply referred to as the single market (plus Switzerland, which confusingly is not a member of the EEA, but has agreed access to the single market). Therefore, the future of Britons' EHIC cover could depend on whether the UK decided to sever ties with the EEA.Probably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report. In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two-thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.However, the UK government is committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, the UK government is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR. However, the EU has its own European Court of Justice, whose decisions are binding on EU institutions and member states.Its rulings have sometimes caused controversy in Britain and supporters of a Brexit have called for immediate legislation to curb its powers. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also cited sovereignty and democracy, and they wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Four of the biggest US banks have committed to helping maintain the City's position. But HSBC will move up to 1,000 jobs to Paris, the BBC understands. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Pest control firm Rentokil Initial says it could make £15m extra this year thanks to a weaker currency.Others are less optimistic. Hilary Jones, a director at UK cosmetics firm Lush said the company was ""terrified"" about the economic impact. She added that while the firm's Dorset factory would continue to produce goods for the UK market, products for the European market may be made at its new plant in Germany.Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After the Leave vote, the government will probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""As with most elements of the UK economy, not enough solid data has been published yet to accurately conclude the Brexit effect on house prices. Industry figures have pointed to ""uncertainty"" among buyers and sellers that could potentially change the housing market.So far, the most significant research has come from the respected Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which has published the conclusions of a survey of its members. This primarily records sentiment among surveyors.It found that house prices are expected to fall across the UK in the three months after the referendum vote. However, the dip in prices is only expected to persist over the 12 months from June in London and East Anglia, surveyors predict.House prices were already slowing in central London, owing to the fall-out from changes to stamp duty rules in April.Separate figures from property portal Rightmove suggested the average asking price of houses coming on to the market in England and Wales fell by 0.9%, or £2,647, in July compared with June. It said that agents had reported very few sales had fallen through as a result of the vote.Many potential first-time buyers would welcome a fall in house prices, with ownership among the young falling owing to affordability concerns. Investors in property, or those who have paid off a mortgage and hope to leave homes as inheritance would be unhappy with a long-term reduction in value.  Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law following the decision to leave the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" will not necessarily disappear overnight - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU means the UK will not be part of TTIP. It will have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Former Labour health secretary Lord Owen has said that because of TTIP (see answer above) the only way to protect the NHS from further privatisation was to get out of the EU."

I don't think so. The coverage of one MP's Early Day Motion (EDM) of no confidence in the Speaker, in the wake of his comments about President Trump, is massively over-egged. First, it's an EDM. They are a form of parliamentary graffiti - a way of expressing an opinion, and nestling amongst the 946 EDMs on such subjects as the Queen's sapphire jubilee, diplomatic relations with Armenia, the Battle of Cable St and organised dog fighting, it has so far attracted a single signature - although that might change when MPs return from their holidays. But the more important point about EDMs is that some special parliamentary acrobatics are needed for them to be debated on the floor of the Commons. The government could provide the time, but it won't. An opposition party could give up some of its allocated time, but they won't. The Backbench Business Committee, which controls its own block of Commons time, could allocate a slot - but it almost certainly won't.So no debate. But what if a large number of MPs do, eventually, sign it? Will a shamed Speaker Bercow retire to his state dining room with a bottle of his own-brand whisky and a loaded revolver? I strongly doubt it. This Speaker saw off a coup attempt on the last day of the 2010 Parliament, when the coalition whips attempted to change the rules on Speaker elections as a precursor to an attempt to unseat him after the general election. That vote was effectively a direct attack on the Speaker - and was supported by 202 MPs. Yet Speaker Bercow did not resign. Like another Marmite politician, he's a fighter, not a quitter. And no-one should make the mistake of assuming he is universally loathed by Tory MPs. The Bercow phenomenon is a complex thing. On the one hand, he's a hardline parliamentary moderniser. On a cosmetic level, he has ditched the grand gold-embroidered robes worn by his predecessors, and most recently, presided over the decision to abandon the court dress worn by the Commons Clerks. But more importantly, he has opened up the procedure of the House, with historically important results.A few months back I wrote about how his rulings provided the parliamentary openings that led to pro-Brexit MPs cornering David Cameron into conceding the EU referendum. But he has also allowed 353 Urgent Questions, putting ministers on the spot on topical issues, so that the Commons is visible on the TV news, debating the issues of the moment. In the 21st Century that is essential. MPs also appreciate his brisk conduct of question times, giving many more their moment in the Parliamentary limelight.But then there's the other side of the coin. His put-downs can be brutal, and Tory MPs believe he targets them more often than the opposition - although the Lib Dems, still smarting from the duffing up of their leader, Tim Farron, at PMQs the other week, might argue that they get swatted too. Where other Speakers might have poured on a little honey ""the Right Hon Gentleman who is a distinguished parliamentarian, should know better…"", Bercow's repartee - like his admonition to Tory Tim Loughton ""the children's minister should stop acting like a child"" - has not been forgotten or forgiven by its targets. His stand-up shouting match with the then government Chief Whip, Patrick McLoughlin, on the floor of the Commons, may be the most spectacular example of a loss of temper, but it's not the only one. To quote Kipling, the burnt Speaker's bandaged finger goes wabbling back to the fire. But there are plenty of reasons why I expect him to survive. First there is no Commons majority to remove him. Support for the Speaker may be the love that dare not speak its name in the Conservative 1922 Committee, but there is a solid phalanx of Bercow-supporting Tories out there. As one senior member of this elusive group put it, ""with this Speaker, you have to take the rough with the smooth"". They believe his failings are a price worth paying for a Speaker who they believe facilitates tough scrutiny of the government.Second, the government has learned the lesson of its attempt to remove him on 26 March 2015, and doesn't want to place its dabs on the dagger this time. And without a government whipping operation behind it, any direct attempt to topple the Speaker is doomed.Third, MPs want to protect the Office. This is a more subtle point. If the Speaker is to be dethroned, his successor will feel vulnerable from day one. They will be less willing to offend, not just ministers, but pretty much anyone. And that means the rights of individual MPs and backbench groupings like the pre-referendum Brexiteers to make life difficult, may be less diligently enforced. This argument convinces a lot of older hands who are not obvious Bercow backers on other grounds.Fourth, he's going anyway. Perhaps later in this Parliament than some may hope, but he's been in the Chair since 2009, and that's a pretty long spell. So why mount a putsch when success is not guaranteed and there's a price to be paid?So when the Bercow era does end, it will be at a time of his choosing."
2017-02-10,Peering ahead,https://web.archive.org//web/20170211031622/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38918526,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkSharpen your pencils. Now Theresa May has her prize from the Commons, getting the Article 50 bill (she never wanted) through with no major changes, it makes its way to the red and gold end of the Palace of Westminster, to the Lords.The first debate is set for 20 February. More than 140 Peers have already put their names down to speak. But at that stage there probably won't be a vote. A week later the thornier more detailed committee stage begins. Then the last certain stage, the third reading and report is scheduled for 7 March. If it all goes according to the government's plan, which sources say is ""hugely unpredictable"", it would allow Theresa May to stick to her timetable and push the button for exit talks to start the next week, once the Bill has been rubber-stamped by the other Palace. (It's daft in this business to make too many predictions, but I d put a fiver on that happening on Wednesday 15 March.)The government will have a bumpier ride in the Lords after a grumpy process in the Commons. The Lords is dramatically different because the government most certainly does not have a majority among peers. And, it is the Lords' express purpose to scrutinise and if needed, improve draft laws before sending them back along the corridor to the Commons.Overnight a government source suggested that the Lords had better jolly well let the Brexit bill go through, or else. Despite the sabre-rattling though, the atmosphere in the Lords is less febrile than that language might suggest.Downing Street this morning tried to dampen down the aggressive briefing. And one source in the Lords described the threat as ""total BS"" - I'll leave you to work that out.The main opposition leader, Baroness Smith, has made it plain on several occasions that although the Lords may try to tweak the Bill, Labour, broadly, has no intention of trying to block it. Her modus operandi is to ""hold to account, not hold to ransom"".The Liberal Democrats are more intent on making changes in the Lords, for it is there they can wield power, rather than in the Commons. But unless they have the support of Labour too, there is a limit to how much trouble they can cause.The chatter suggests the Lords will push for concessions from the government over the rights of EU citizens to stay here, reporting the progress of negotiations regularly to Parliament and maybe on a final ""meaningful vote"" for both Houses on the deal.It will be up to the government to decide whether to tweak the bill slightly as they did in the Commons or risk some defeats. Insiders predict it is likely the Lords may end up sending back the bill to the Commons once, as ""ping pong"" to force the government to make a change or two. But even senior Lib Dem sources don't expect hostile stand-offs for weeks on end. The Lords will make their voices heard, there is no question about that and the Article 50 bill could run into trouble. It would be wrong to suggest that ministers don't anticipate a tricky time. But today at least, whatever the sabre-rattling from some parts of government, this historic piece of legislation looks likely to be the subject of a few skirmishes in the Lords, rather than an apocalyptic battle.

2017-02-10,Ward-by ward,https://web.archive.org//web/20170211031622/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38762034,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe BBC has obtained a more localised breakdown of votes from nearly half of the local authorities which counted EU referendum ballots last June.This information provides much greater depth and detail in explaining the pattern of how the UK voted. The key findings are:A statistical analysis of the data obtained for over a thousand individual local government wards confirms how the strength of the local Leave vote was strongly associated with lower educational qualifications.Wards where the population had fewer qualifications tended to have a higher Leave vote, as shown in the chart. If the proportion of the local electorate with a degree or similar qualification was one percentage point lower, then on average the leave vote was higher by nearly one percentage point.Using ward-level data means we can compare voting figures in this way to the local demographic information collected in the 2011 census. Of the main census statistics, this is the one with the greatest association with how people voted. In statistical terms the level of educational qualifications explains about two-thirds of the variation in the results between different wards. The correlation is strong, whether based on assessing graduate and equivalent qualifications or lower-level ones. This ward-by-ward analysis covers 1,070 individual wards in England and Wales whose boundaries had not changed since the 2011 census, about one in nine of the UK's wards. We had very little ward-level data from Scotland, and none from Northern Ireland.It should be noted, however, that many ward counts also included some postal votes from across the counting area, and therefore some variation between wards will have been masked by the random allocation of postal votes for counting. This makes the results less accurate geographically, but we can still use the information to explore broad national and local patterns.  Adding age as a second factor significantly helps to further explain voting patterns. Older populations were more likely to vote Leave. Education and age combined account for nearly 80% of the voting variation between wards. Ethnicity is a smaller factor, but one which also contributed to the results. Adding that in means that now 83% of the variation in the vote between wards is explained. White populations were generally more pro-Leave, and ethnic minorities less so.  However, there were some interesting differences between London and elsewhere.The ethnic dimension is particularly interesting when examining the outliers on the graph that compares the Leave vote to levels of education.There are numerous wards towards the bottom left of the graph where electorates with lower educational qualifications nevertheless produced low Leave and high Remain votes. This is where the link between low qualifications and Leave voting breaks down. It turns out that these exceptional wards have high ethnic minority populations, particularly in Birmingham and Haringey in north London. In contrast, there are virtually no dramatic outliers on the other side of the line, where comparatively highly educated populations voted Leave. Only one point on the graph stands out - this is Osterley and Spring Grove in Hounslow, west London, a mainly ethnic minority ward which had a Leave vote of 63%. While this figure does include some postal votes, they are not nearly enough to explain away this unusual outcome.In fact, in Ealing and Hounslow, west London boroughs with many voters of Asian origin, the ethnic correlation was in the other direction to the national picture: a higher number of Asian voters was associated with a higher Leave vote.This powerful link to educational attainment could stem from the lower qualified tending to feel less confident about their prospects and ability to compete for work in a competitive globalised economy with high levels of migration. On the other hand some commentators see it as primarily reflecting a ""culture war"" or ""values conflict"", rather than issues of economics and inequality. Research shows that non-graduates tend to take less liberal positions than graduates on a range of social issues from immigration and multi-culturalism to the death penalty.   The former campaign director of Vote Leave, Dominic Cummings, argues that the better educated are more prone to holding irrational political opinions because they are more driven by fashion and a group mentality. Of course this assessment does not imply that Leave voters were almost all poorly educated and old, and Remain voters well educated and young. The Leave side obviously attracted support from many middle class professionals, graduates and younger people. Otherwise it couldn't have won. While there was undoubtedly a lot of voting which cut across these criteria, the point of this analysis is to explore how different social groups most probably voted - and it is clear that education, age and ethnicity were crucial influences.  After these three key factors are taken into account, adding in further demographic measures from the census does little to increase the explanation of UK-wide voting patterns. However, this does not reflect the distinctively more pro-Remain voting in Scotland, since we are short of Scottish data at this geographical level. It is clear as well that in a few specific locations high student numbers were also very relevant. To a certain extent, using the level of educational qualifications as a measure combines both class and age factors, with working class and older adults both tending to be less well qualified.But the association between education and the voting results is stronger than the association between social or occupational class and the results. This is still true after taking the age of the local population into account.This suggests that voters with lower qualifications were more likely to back Leave than the better qualified, even when they were in the same social or occupational class.The existence of a significant connection between Leave voting and lower educational qualifications had already been suggested by analysis of the published referendum results from the official counting areas.The data we have obtained strengthens this conclusion, because voting patterns can now be compared to social statistics from the 2011 census at a much more detailed geographical level than by the earlier studies. The BBC analysis is also consistent with opinion polling (for example, from Lord Ashcroft, Ipsos Mori and YouGov) that tried to identify the characteristics of Leave and Remain voters.  The data we have collected can be used to illustrate the sort of places where the Leave and Remain camps did particularly well: it is hard to imagine a more glaring social contrast than that between the deprived, poorly educated housing estates of Brambles and Thorntree in Middlesbrough, and the privileged elite colleges of Market ward in central Cambridge. It is important to bear in mind, however, that most of the voting figures mentioned below also include some postal votes, so they should be treated as approximate rather than precise.  It is also important to note that the examples are limited to the places for which we were able to obtain localised information, which was only a minority of areas. The rest of the country may well contain even starker instances.Of the 1,283 individual wards for which we have data, the highest Leave vote was 82.5% in Brambles and Thorntree, a section of east Middlesbrough with many social problems. Ward boundaries have changed since the 2011 census, but in that survey the Thorntree part of the area had the lowest proportion of people with a degree or similar qualification of anywhere in England and Wales, at only 5%. And according to Middlesbrough council, the figure for the current Brambles and Thorntree ward is even lower, at just 4%. Second highest was 80.3% in Waterlees Village, a poor locality within Wisbech, Cambridgeshire. This area has seen a major influx of East European migrants who have been doing low-paid work in nearby food processing factories and farms, with tensions between them and British residents. Other wards with available data which had the strongest Leave votes were congregated in Middlesbrough, Canvey Island in Essex, Skegness in coastal Lincolnshire, and Havering in east London.The highest Remain vote was 87.8% in Market ward in central Cambridge, an area with numerous colleges and a high student population, in a city which was strongly pro-Remain.This was followed by Ashley ward  (85.6%) in central Bristol, a district featuring ethnic diversity, gentrification and alternative culture.Next highest was Northumberland Park (85.0%) in Haringey, north London, which has a substantial black population. Other wards with available data which had the strongest Remain votes were generally located in Cambridge, Bristol and the multi-ethnic London boroughs of Haringey and Lambeth. The count for Ashburton in Croydon, south London, split 50-50 exactly, with both Leave and Remain getting 3,885 votes, but that did include some postal ballots.As for being nearest to the overall result, the combined count of Tulketh and University, neighbouring wards near the centre of Preston, was 51.92% for leave, very close to the UK wide figure of 51.89%. The individual ward of Barnwood in Gloucester had Leave at 51.94%. Both figures however contain some postal votes.Given that a few councils provided even more detailed data down to the level of polling districts, it is possible to identify some very small localities that were nicely representative of the national picture. The 527 voters in the neighbouring districts of Kirk Langley and Mackworth in Amber Valley in Derbyshire, whose two ballot boxes were counted together, produced a leave proportion of 51.99%. And this figure is not contaminated by any postal votes.So journalists (or anyone else for that matter) who seek a microcosm of the UK should perhaps visit the Mundy Arms pub in Mackworth, the location for that district's polling station.Similarly, the 427 voters in the combined neighbouring polling districts of Chiddingstone Hoath and Hever Four Elms to the south of Sevenoaks in Kent delivered a leave vote of 51.6% (again, without any postal votes).The data obtained points to 269 areas of various sizes (wards, clusters of wards or constituencies) which had a different Leave/Remain outcome compared to the official counting area of which they were part.This consists of 150 areas which backed Remain but were part of Leave-voting counting areas; and 119 in the other direction. The detailed information therefore gives us an understanding of how the electorate voted which is more variegated than the officially published results.Every one of Scotland's 32 counting areas came down on the Remain side. Yet, despite the fact that most Scottish councils did not give us much detailed information, we can nevertheless identify a few smaller parts of the country which actually backed Leave.A cluster of six wards in the Banff and Buchan area in north Aberdeenshire had a strong Leave majority of 61%. There is much local discontent within the fishing industry of this coastal district about the EU's common fisheries policy.An Taobh Siar agus Nis, a ward at the northern end of the Isle of Lewis in Na h-Eileanan an Iar (Western Isles), also voted Leave, if very narrowly. And at a smaller geographical level, in Shetland the 567 voters in the combined polling districts of Whalsay and South Unst had an extremely high Leave vote of 81%. The island of Whalsay is a fishing community, where EU rules have been controversial and in 2012 numerous skippers were heavily fined for major breaches of fishing quotas.Ealing and Hounslow are neighbouring multi-ethnic boroughs in the west of London with large Asian populations, where - in contrast to the national picture - non-white ethnicity was associated with voting Leave, particularly in Ealing. Both boroughs shared a varied internal pattern of prosperous largely white areas voting strongly Remain, poorer largely white areas preferring Leave, and the Asian areas tending to be more evenly split.Ealing voted 60% Remain, with Southfield ward hitting 76%, but in contrast the Southall wards which are over 90% ethnic minority were close to 50-50.In Hounslow the richer wards in Chiswick in the east of the area voted heavily Remain (73%), but the poorer largely white wards at the opposite western end in Feltham and Bedfont voted Leave (64-66%). Osterley and Spring Grove was also 63% Leave, the highest Leave vote in any individual ward in the UK with a non-white majority for which we have data. The south London borough of Bromley narrowly voted Remain. Those parts which did not do so by a significant margin were the Cray Valley wards, largely poor white working class areas; and Biggin Hill and Darwin wards, locations to the south which contain more open countryside and lie outside the built-up commuter belt. In Croydon in south London, places which voted Leave by substantial amounts were New Addington and Fieldway, neighbouring wards with large council estates. Beyond the areas with the strongest backing for Leave and Remain, examining the detailed breakdown of votes in various places gives greater insight into the pattern of support for the two sides - as can be seen from the following examples.In several places (for example, Birmingham, Bristol, Nottingham, Portsmouth) there was a strong contrast between the Leave-voting populations of large, rundown, predominantly white, housing estates in the urban periphery, versus Remain-voting populations in inner city areas with large numbers of ethnic minorities and sometimes students.Birmingham had several wards with large Remain votes, although the city as a whole narrowly voted Leave.  These pro-Remain wards tended to be the more highly educated, better off localities, or minority ethnic areas which strongly backed Remain despite low levels of educational qualifications. I have written about this before. In Blackburn with Darwen, Bastwell ward had the highest Remain vote at 65%, compared to only 44% in the area as a whole. This ward has an ethnic minority proportion of over 90%. Other Blackburn wards which voted Remain were also ones with high minority populations.Bradford voted to Leave (54%), but the area included some starkly contrasting places which went over 60% Remain: the prosperous, genteel, spa town of Ilkley, and strongly ethnic minority wards in the city, such as Manningham and Toller.Bristol voted strongly Remain on the whole (62%), but there were some striking exceptions, particularly the large, deprived, mainly white estates to the south of the city. Hartcliffe and Withywood backed Leave at 67%. Similar neighbouring wards (Hengrove and Whitchurch Park, Filwood, Bishopsworth and Stockwood) also voted Leave, as did the more industrial area of Avonmouth and Lawrence Weston to the north west of the city.As a county Cornwall voted to Leave. But one of its six parliamentary constituencies, Truro and Falmouth, voted 53% to Remain, possibly linked to a significant student population.In Lincoln, which voted 57% to Leave, Carholme ward stands out as very different - it voted 63% to Remain. This ward includes Lincoln University, and 43% of the residents are students Middlesbrough voted 65% to Leave. As already noted, it had several wards with extremely high leave votes of over 75%. But one ward, Linthorpe, voted very narrowly to Remain - a comparatively well-to-do inner suburb which includes an art college; and another ward, Central, which contains Teesside University, nearly did. Mole Valley in Surrey exhibited a dramatic contrast between two neighbouring districts with very different demographics and housing. The highest Remain vote was in the very prosperous location of Dorking South, which voted 63% Remain, but the neighbouring ward of Holmwoods, dominated by large estates on the edge of the town of Dorking, voted 57% Leave, the area's highest Leave vote. Nottingham voted narrowly to Leave, but the inner city ward of Radford and Park voted 68% Remain. This has both a comparatively high proportion of ethnic minorities and considerable numbers of students from two nearby universities. There was a lot of variation within the area. Bulwell - a market town to the north of the city with many social problems - voted 69% Leave  There was also a high Leave vote in the housing estate locations of the Clifton wards in the south of Nottingham.Oldham voted to Leave at 61%, but Werneth, the city ward with the highest ethnic minority population, voted Remain (57%). Other wards with high minority populations also voted Remain.In Oxford the cluster of polling districts which included Blackbird Leys and other deprived estates on the southern edge of the city voted to Leave at 51%. In contrast the central areas containing colleges, university buildings and student accommodation voted to Remain at over 80%.Plymouth voted 60% Leave, but Drake ward which includes the university had the city's highest Remain vote at 56%. Portsmouth was another place with wide variation. Paulsgrove ward, with its large estate on the edge of the city, had the highest Leave vote at 70%, whereas at the other end of the spectrum Central Southsea, an inner city ward and student area, voted 57% Remain.Rochdale voted 60% Leave. The place which bucked this trend by voting 59% Remain, Milkstone and Deeplish, was the most predominantly ethnic minority ward. Central Rochdale had the second highest Remain vote and is the other ward that is mainly not white. Walsall voted strongly Leave (68%). The only ward which voted Remain, Paddock, is both a comparatively prosperous and multi-ethnic locality.A few councils released their data at remarkably localised levels, down even to individual polling districts (ie ballot boxes) in the case of Blackburn with Darwen and Bracknell Forest, or clusters of two/three/four districts, in the case of Amber Valley, Brentwood, Sevenoaks, Shetland, South Oxfordshire, and Tewkesbury.This provides very local and specific data, in some cases just for neighbourhoods of hundreds of voters.At its most detailed this reveals that the 110 people who cast their votes in the ballot box at St. Alban's Primary School in central Blackburn split 56-52 in favour of Remain, with two spoilt papers.It also discloses stark contrasts in some neighbouring locations. The 953 people who voted at Little Harwood community centre in north Blackburn had a Leave vote of only 31%, while the 336 electors who voted in the neighbouring ballot box at Roe Lee Park primary school produced a Leave percentage over twice as high, at 64%.The very detailed data we obtained also provides some rare evidence on the views of postal compared to non-postal voters. Campaign strategists have often deliberated on whether the two groups vote differently and should be given separate targeted messages.Most places mixed boxes of postal and non-postal votes for counting, so generally it's not possible to draw comparative conclusions. However there were a few exceptions which recorded them separately, or included a very small number of non-postal votes with the postals.These figures indicate that postal voters were narrowly less likely to back Leave than voters in polling stations. Data covering five counting areas with about 260,000 votes shows that in these places the roughly one in five electors who voted by post backed Leave at 55.4%, one percentage point lower than the local non-postal support for Leave of 56.4%.The counting areas involved are Amber Valley, East Cambridgeshire, Gwynedd, Hyndburn and North Warwickshire.Since the referendum the BBC has been trying to get the most detailed, localised voting data we could from each of the counting areas.  This was a major data collection exercise carried out by my colleague George Greenwood. We managed to obtain voting figures broken down into smaller geographical units for 178 of the 399 referendum counting areas (380 councils in England, Wales and Scotland, with a separate tally in Gibraltar, while in Northern Ireland results were issued for the 18 constituencies). This varied between data for individual local government wards, wards grouped into clusters, and constituency level data. In a few cases the results supplied were even more localised than ward level. Overall the extra data covers a wide range of different areas and kinds of councils across the UK. Electoral returning officers are not covered by the Freedom of Information Act, so releasing the information was up to the discretion of councils. While some were very willing, in other cases it required a lot of persistence and persuasion. Some councils could not supply any detailed data because they mixed all ballot boxes prior to counting; some did possess more local figures but simply refused to disclose them to us. Others did provide data, but the combinations in which ballot boxes were mixed before counting were too complex to fit ward boundaries neatly.A few places such as Birmingham released their ward by ward data following the referendum on their own initiative, but in most cases the information had to be obtained by us requesting it directly, and sometimes repeatedly, from the authority."

The government has now specified what would count as exceptional circumstances. It is not clear whether the new rules will be more or less strict than just letting councils decide what counted as exceptional circumstances. The government has described the housing market as broken, promised more affordable homes and said it would help people to buy and rent.A big question in discussions of increasing the supply of homes is whether planning regulations will be changed to make it easier to build on green belt land.Green belts were introduced after World War Two to stop cities from sprawling and countryside being spoilt. About 13% of England is now covered.This covers scenic sites open to the public, such as the Chiltern Hills and North Downs, but it also covers a lot of land that has limited public access and may not be particularly beautiful.In the House of Commons, Communities Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""In 2015, we promised the British people that the green belt was safe in our hands and that is still the case.""So what has changed?There has been little variation in the amount of green belt land since 1997, although data is not available for every year.The Housing White Paper says the current planning regulations allow building on the green belt only ""in exceptional circumstances"" but that there is no detail given of what would amount to exceptional circumstances.The government has now specified that before allowing development on green belt land, councils would need to rule out options including: The White Paper also says that councils allowing the boundaries of green belt land to be changed would have to make up for it by improving other bits of green belt. It also asks for suggestions of other things councils should take into account before doing so. Read more from Reality Check"
2017-02-10,Budget lookahead,https://web.archive.org//web/20170211031622/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-38891441,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkPhilip Hammond knows all about the government's attempts to ""get the public finances in order"" following the financial crisis of 2008.He was the man, as shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, credited by many for the tough detail of the austerity plan laid before voters in the run up to the 2010 election.George Osborne was the architect, Mr Hammond the foreman, ensuring there was a plan that might actually have a chance of working, public sector cut by public sector cut.Now Mr Hammond is the man in charge of the public finances - his dream government job and, a relatively rare occurrence for the resident of Number 11, said authoritatively to be the high water mark of his ambitions.Whatever his relations with the Prime Minister, and they are better than often reported, the fact that he doesn't want to move his sofas next door is a useful salve to any scratchiness between Downing Street's most important neighbours.Today sees the publication of the Institute for Fiscal Studies' (IFS) annual Green Budget, its analysis of Mr Hammond's room for manoeuvre as he prepares for the real Budget, on 8 March.There is one clear message.If you thought the era of cuts is over, think again.Day-to-day spending, officially known rather more prosaically as the Resource Departmental Expenditure Limit (which excludes investment spending), is set to fall by 4% over the next three years.The IFS says that a ""particularly sharp cut"" has been loaded onto the last year of the parliament, 2019-20, never a particularly comfortable time for a government to be squeezing the public sector pips even more aggressively.Alongside that, the IFS says the overall tax burden is set to rise as a proportion of national income to the highest level since 1986.That is not a function of actual tax rises - taxes for many millions of people have fallen as income tax thresholds have risen - but a function of a relatively high tax take throughout an era of pretty stagnant growth.Will Mr Hammond change course on 8 March, and further loosen the government's austerity strictures as he did in the Autumn Statement last year - pushing the deficit reduction target into the conveniently indistinct long grass of ""during the next parliament""?The government has, after all, promised an economy that works for all.I am told not - and that Mr Hammond is approaching his first Budget as a ""steady-as-she-goes affair"" with no major yanks on the national rudder, particularly given the economy's robust performance since the Brexit referendum.It has been pointed out to me that, just ahead of the triggering of Article 50 - the official mechanism for leaving the European Union - the last thing Britain needs is a reset of fiscal policy.In 2010, the Conservatives were elected as the party that would bring public income and public expenditure into balance.Mr Hammond still cleaves to that view. ""He is a Conservative,"" as one official close to him says.George Osborne's economic approach is alive and well. Yes, there are criticisms by some economists that there is no need to run a country like a household budget where pennies in and pennies out matter - governments are able to borrow at very cheap rates on the international markets and put that money to economically valuable use.Yes, there are criticisms that debt costs as a percentage of national income are low by historic standards and so the room for manoeuvre is rather greater than the national debt headline figures suggest.But those close to Mr Hammond argue that, OK, borrowing may be cheap now but servicing Britain's £1.7 trillion debt is still expensive, costing around £34bn a year, or 4.6% of all government spending.Cut out the deficit and start dealing with the debt and those costs can be brought down.Certainly, since the referendum, the cost of government debt has increased as rising inflation risk pushes up yields - the interest rate on government bonds issued to investors.Mr Hammond is briefing the Cabinet for the first time this week on the broad parameters of next month's Budget.He will talk about Britain's historic productivity problem and how to solve it, he will talk about skills, he will talk about research and development support and he will talk about infrastructure spending.Supporting the private economy is his priority, not reversing public sector cuts.Mr Hammond will also say that the new world of work - the gig economy - is affecting the way the Treasury has to approach complicated issues such as tax receipts as the number of self-employed - who tend to pay a lower proportion of their income to the state - grows.A lot of it will be rhetoric at this stage.For Mr Hammond wants to keep his powder dry.Dry for the bigger fiscal event of the year, the autumn Budget (as we should now call it) in November or December.As he said last year, he only wants one major tax and spend ""moment"" a year.And it's not going to be next month.

2017-02-10,NHS week,https://web.archive.org//web/20170211031622/http://www.bbc.com/news/health-38853700,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkNo matter where you live in the UK, you will find local NHS services are under immense pressure. None of the four nations is achieving any of its three key targets for A&E, cancer or routine treatments, such as knee and hip replacements.All have developed plans and strategies to deal with the common challenges - rising demand, squeezes on funding and the ageing population. But each has found this winter to be particularly difficult. Spending: £2,057 per personKey fact: Just one hospital trust hit the four-hour A&E target in the first week of January.The system: The NHS is split between providers of services, known as NHS trusts, and commissioners, working for clinical commissioning groups. Social care, covering care homes and help in the home, is organised by councils and is means-tested.The story so far: The first week of January was the most difficult since the four-hour target was introduced in 2004. The proportion of patients being treated or discharged in time fell below 78%, with nearly half of hospitals declaring major alerts because of a shortage of beds.An estimated one in five patients ended up facing long delays for a bed after an emergency admission - double the normal rate - while ambulance crews reported problems handing over patients to A&E staff.It comes after a gradual increase in pressures in recent years. The winters have been getting progressively worst, while the 62-day target for cancer treatment to begin following an urgent GP referral has been missed for 11 months in a row. The number of people on hospital waiting lists for a routine operation has also been rising.NHS bosses set out a five-year vision for the NHS, which involved a greater emphasis on keeping people well in the community. But savings also have to be made - there is a £22bn target for 2020. This has led to the development of 44 local plans to overhaul services - some of which involve closing hospitals and cutting staff.Spending: £2,125 per personKey fact: 63% of A&E patients were seen in four hours over the Christmas period.The system: There are five integrated health and care boards that run hospitals, community services and social care. The over-75s get free care in their own home if they have high needs.The story so far: Northern Ireland has some of the worst performance figures in the UK. During the Christmas period, the number of patients seen in four hours in A&E departments dropped to 63%.Exactly the same proportion started their cancer treatment within 62 days, according to the latest statistics, while the numbers waiting longer than they should for a routine operation have almost doubled in the past four years.In response to the growing pressures, ministers have already set out a new vision for the health service, which they acknowledged was at ""breaking point"". A 10-year plan was published in the autumn, which called for greater investment in general practice as a way of coping with the rising demands on hospitals.The plan was widely criticised for its lack of detail and costings. It did not mention hospital closures, but there is a general consensus that Northern Ireland has too many small units and care would be better concentrated in fewer bigger centres.Political instability in Northern Ireland, which is facing its second assembly election in less than a year, also means the budget for the next financial year has yet to be agreed.Spending: £2,160 per personKey fact: Scotland was the last nation to hits its A&E target - in July.The system: The NHS is run by 14 health boards that organise hospital and community services. Social care is organised by councils with personal care - that is help with  washing and dressing - provided free in people's homes and residential care if an individual has high needs. The story so far: Out of all the four nations, hospitals in Scotland seem to have fared the best. Weekly data shows four-hour performance in major units hovering around the 90% mark during January.Much of the credit has been given to the way councils and the health service are working together. Budgets have been pooled, encouraging a close working relationship to help get frail patients out of hospital by providing extra rehabilitation services in the community.But most of the progress has been concentrated in and around Glasgow and Edinburgh, where over a quarter of the population lives. Arguably, this gives Scotland an advantage, as improvements in just two regions can have a significant impact on performance.In terms of cancer treatment, over 87% started treatment within 62 days, according to the latest figures, below the 95% target.Spending: £2,084 per personKey fact: 81% of patients were seen in four hours in A&E during December.The system: The NHS is run by seven health boards that organise hospital and community services. Social care is organised by councils, which cap the cost of home care at £60 a week. The story so far: NHS Wales boss Dr Andrew Goodall has described the pressures seen this winter as ""exceptional"". Some hospitals have been reporting a 10% rise in admissions compared with 12 months previously, while the ambulance services said the start of the year had been the busiest on record.The government invested an extra £50m to help hospitals deal with winter pressures and this paid for an extra 400 beds - the equivalent of one more district general hospital.But the numbers being seen in four hours during December dropped to 81% - well below the 95% target.And the numbers waiting over 12 hours nearly hit 2,500 - a rise of two-thirds on the same period the year before.Wales has become the first part of the UK to redefine how it deals with 999 calls. Instead of requiring ambulances to reach a third of calls in eight minutes, it narrowed the number of conditions needing an urgent response and now just aims for this in abut 5% of cases. Ambulance bosses say this has allowed the service to use its fleet more effectively, which means the most life-threatening cases are getting quicker treatment.Over 86% of patients given an urgent GP referral get cancer treatment within 62-days - some way short of the 95% target.Do you have a question about the NHS?

The veteran Gaullist already has form.When he was Commissioner for the Internal Market and Financial Services, Mr Barnier was dubbed ""the most dangerous man in Europe"" after taking on the banking sector and championing a cap on bankers' bonuses. But while he alarmed some in the City, and will probably do so again, he also won grudging respect as a tough but even-handed negotiator.He will need all those skills and more in his new role - chief Brexit negotiator at the European Commission. And having moved seamlessly between big jobs in Paris and Brussels - French foreign minister, Commissioner, MEP - he looks well prepared. ""Don't ask me to tell you what will be at the end of the road, we haven't begun to walk yet,"" he told a conference in Brussels last month. Mr Barnier will stick closely to the official EU position of ""no negotiation without notification"" - waiting for the UK to trigger Article 50 to start the formal process of withdrawal. But he's clearly eager to get going.""I am waiting to begin,"" he said. ""I will be ready tomorrow to negotiate, frankly speaking.""And he will bring with him an instinctive pro-European agenda, and a deep knowledge of the workings of the single market.His deputy as chief Brexit negotiator is a German trade expert, Sabine Weyand, adding to the impression that Mr Barnier will lead a team that means business.One of the biggest challenges he (and his boss Jean-Claude Juncker) faces, is to ensure that representatives of the big member states don't sideline him in the Brexit divorce negotiations.But Mr Barnier's long career in French politics means he could well have the ear of the Elysee Palace, especially if - as looks likely - a centre-right candidate wins the French presidency next year. The stakes are so high that there are bound to be some clashes.Mr Barnier has sparred with the UK's Minister for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, before, when the men both served as Europe ministers in the 1990s. It is another reminder that Michel Barnier is a politician first and foremost, rather than a bureaucrat. There have certainly been criticisms - a dash of vanity, a lack of attention to detail. His career has had plenty of downs as well as ups.But he will defend his European vision to the end, and the British government would do well not to underestimate him.At the height of the eurozone crisis, Mr Barnier always refused (politely) to do broadcast interviews in English.""One wrong word,"" he told me once with a smile, ""and we could move markets.""The next few years will be equally challenging."

Scotland voted 62% in favour of Remain.The conversation online was being driven overwhelmingly by pro-independence campaigners. But people who had supported ""Better Together"" during the Scottish referendum vote also spoke about the possibility of a break-away from the UK as a result of the vote over EU membership.  Perhaps the most significant was Scottish author JK Rowling who tweeted: ""Scotland will seek independence now. Cameron's legacy will be breaking up two unions. Neither needed to happen.""Many took to Twitter to express new or strengthened pro-independence feelings in the wake of the latest vote (Just as a reminder: a ""Yes"" vote in Scotland's 2014 referendum was for independence, while the winning ""No"" campaign backed staying in the UK).One old tweet from 2014's independence referendum gained new life on Friday.

In highlighting football, it said attitudes in sport in general are out of step with wider society.There are no openly gay professional male players in British football.The wide-ranging report said more should be done to show support for athletes who want to come out.It also said match officials at all levels of sport should have a clear duty to report and document any kind of abuse, and sporting authorities should issue immediate one to two-year bans to indicate clearly that homophobic behaviour would not be tolerated. Damian Collins MP, chairman of the committee, said: ""From the evidence we have received in this inquiry, we believe there are many gay athletes who have not come out, because they are frightened of the impact this decision will have on their careers, and the lives of the people they love. ""That is not acceptable and should not be tolerated.""The committee said the report had been commissioned in part following Tyson Fury's inclusion in the shortlist for the 2015 BBC Sports Personality of the Year award. The inclusion of Fury, who had made homophobic remarks, is ""symptomatic of homophobia not being taken seriously enough in sport, or the media that shows it"", according to the report.The committee said it was ""very dissatisfied"" with BBC director general Tony Hall's response to the controversy.In a statement, a BBC spokesperson said: ""The British public decides who becomes Sports Personality of the Year.""A panel of experts in sport unanimously agreed that Tyson Fury should be on the shortlist for the public vote based solely on his sporting achievement in being crowned world heavyweight champion - we were clear it was not an endorsement of his personal views.""

                        A Football Association spokesperson said: ""We welcome the select committee's report on how to address homophobia in sport and we will review it in full.""It is an issue that we take very seriously and, as the chairman has previously stated, tackling homophobia, transphobia and biphobia in football is one of his top priorities.""In 2012, a Culture, Media and Sport Committee report on racism in sport found homophobia was emerging as a ""bigger problem in football than racism and other forms of discrimination"". Research at the time found 25% of fans thought homophobia was present in football, compared to 10% who thought racism was. In May 2015, the 'Out on the Fields' study - the first international study into homophobia in sport - found 73% of survey participants did not believe youth sports were a 'supportive and safe' place for LGB participants.A recent Stonewall survey reported 72% of football fans have heard homophobic abuse while, in October, a BBC Radio 5 live survey found 82% of supporters would have no issue with a gay player, but 8% said they would stop watching their team.Damian Collins MP, chair of the Culture, Media and Sport Committee""No sportsperson should feel under pressure or feel 'forced' to come out, but sports authorities must create an environment, in the stadium and the locker room, where players and athletes at all levels feel it is a choice they can make, and that they will be supported and accepted if they do. ""More needs to be done by the authorities to address both the overt and latent homophobia that exists within sport. ""Sanctions appear to be left to the discretion of the club or governing body involved: a zero-tolerance approach to the use of all homophobic language and behaviours must be implemented with standardised sanctions across all sports."""

Convention dictates that members of the leader's shadow cabinet team should resign or be sacked if they defy such an order.Some did resign but the remaining rebels are to receive only a letter insisting that they must comply with the whip in the future.The decision not to sack them leaves Labour facing the prospect of three whips trying to persuade their colleagues to vote with a leader who himself rebelled against Labour more than 400 times - when they have defied him themselves, BBC political correspondent Chris Mason says.Mr Lewis has since been replaced as shadow business secretary by Rebecca Long-Bailey.The churn in Corbyn's shadow cabinetSpeaking to the Eastern Daily Press, Mr Lewis, who is MP for Norwich, said his resignation was not the beginning of a bid to challenge Mr Corbyn for the party leadership, adding that he was ""working hard"" to support him from the back benches. A string of resignations from the Labour front bench mean there are still a ""couple of vacancies"" to be filled but it is not expected there will be any further announcements until next week.New appointments announced on Friday include Ian Lavery and Andrew Gwynne, who become joint national elections and campaign coordinators.Jon Trickett has become shadow minister for the Cabinet Office and will remain shadow Lord President of the Council.4Shadow Cabinet re-shuffles in 18 months32  resignations, of whom... 4 later returned to top positions  4 of those who quit, did so to vote against the Brexit Bill The draft Brexit legislation was approved by 494 votes to 122 in Wednesday's vote and now moves to the House of Lords.Prime Minister Theresa May wants to trigger formal Brexit talks by the end of March.She will do this by invoking Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty but requires Parliament's permission before doing so."
2017-02-11,Child protection opt-outs 'dangerous',https://web.archive.org//web/20170212031033/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-38933234,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkPlans to allow councils to opt out of key legal duties to vulnerable children have been labelled a ""serious danger"" by a former government adviser.Prof Eileen Munro, whose social work review inspired the Children and Social Work Bill, said the opt-outs create ""more dangers than benefits"".Under the bill, children's rights and checks on care could be set aside by councils trying new ways of working.Ministers said it was wrong to say that children would be at risk as a result.Instead they argue the Bill is a bold approach to removing red tape and allowing innovative ways of working. The Bill, which is going through Parliament, has been described as ""a bonfire of child protection rights"", with many campaigners arguing that to allow councils to opt out of these long-standing duties would be risky and unnecessary.If it becomes law, local authorities would be able to apply to the secretary of state to be exempted from one or more legal duties for a period of three years so it could try out new ways of working.This could then be extended for a further three years.Ministers have regularly cited Prof Munro as a supporter of what the government refers to as ""innovation powers"", referring to a statement issued last year in which she supported the plans. However, the professor of social policy has now signalled her opposition to the Bill in an email to children's rights campaign group Article 39.""I have reached the conclusion that the power to have exemption from primary and secondary legislation creates more dangers than the benefits it might produce,"" she said.""While I understand and respect the motivation of the current government, there is a serious danger in having such wide-reaching powers in statute.  ""Some future secretary of state might use them in ways that are completely contrary to the current intentions and consequently subvert the will of Parliament.""The legal duties affected by the Bill relate to nearly all the social care services children receive from local authorities, which have been laid down in numerous acts of Parliament.These include statutory rights on child protection, family support, children's homes and fostering, support to care leavers and services for disabled children.About 50 organisations publicly oppose the proposed exemptions, including the British Association of Social Workers, the Care Leavers' Association, Women's Aid, Liberty and the National Association of People Abused in Childhood.Article 39 director Carolyne Willow said: ""The death knell has finally sounded for this appalling attack on children's law and parliamentary sovereignty.""From the start, ministers claimed their dangerous plan to test out the removal of legal protection from vulnerable children and young people had the backing of Prof Munro. Well now she has walked away. ""Peers rejected these clauses, more than 50 organisations oppose them, social workers and others with long careers helping children reject them and more than 107,000 members of the public have signed a petition against them. ""Nobody wants our child protection and welfare system to lose its legal infrastructure.""Ministers must do the decent thing for children and young people and withdraw these hated clauses.""A Department for Education spokeswoman said: ""We know that over-regulation can get in the way of good social work practice, and the power to innovate will allow local authorities to test new approaches in a carefully controlled and monitored way. ""We have amended these clauses to strengthen the safeguards - to suggest the power to innovate would place children at risk is simply wrong.""   "
2017-02-11,Public parks 'risk falling into neglect',https://web.archive.org//web/20170212031033/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38935787,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkPublic parks are at risk of falling into neglect as funding to maintain them comes under pressure, says a report by a committee of MPs.The squeeze has resulted in reduced opening hours, the removal of play equipment, toilets closing and more litter, vandalism and rats, MPs said.They urged councils to find new ways to fund and manage parks.The Local Government Association said councils have to balance spending on parks against other priorities.The report by the Commons Communities and Local Government (CLG) Committee argued housing demand was also putting parks at risk, with new homes ""nibbling away"" at green spaces in some areas.Unless parks were recognised as ""much more than just grass and tulips"", there was a risk of turning the clock back to an era of neglect of 20 to 30 years ago, the MPs warned.Local authorities have no statutory duty to fund and maintain public parks, and a 2014 report by the Heritage Lottery Fund found 86% of park managers had seen cuts to their budgets since 2010.The UK has about 27,000 public parks attracting 2.6 billion visits a year.The MPs argued that parks play an important role by:Councils should publish strategic plans that recognise parks' wider value and consider a range of alternative models for looking after parks, they said.However, the MPs added, they should remain owned by local authorities and be freely available to everyone.The MPs also entered the debate over the free use of parks by organisations such as Parkrun, which hit the headlines when a parish council tried to charge for its weekly runs in a Bristol park last year.Community organisations, such as Parkrun, which do not charge for participation or raise revenue, could be encouraged to contribute volunteer time to help maintain parks or undertake fundraising, the report said.Helen Griffiths, chief executive of Fields in Trust, a charity that seeks better statutory protection for recreational spaces, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that parks can help to get more people active, tackle obesity and address anti-social behaviour.""I think it is really important that we shouldn't see parks as a drain on our services, not as a budget just for cutting the grass, but as an area that can make a real contribution to tackling some of those very important issues,"" she said.Peter Fleming, deputy chairman of the Local Government Association, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Many councils are saying actually the park is an asset that can help things around public health, but also around how we bring open spaces for families who live in urban areas as well.""But we have to try and balance that spending against those other priorities that councils have, so it is a difficult thing.""Parkrun UK facts and figures:•Number of events - 78,995•Number of locations - 443•Average run time - 00:27:54•Number of runners - 1,199,064•Total distance run - 69,671,120km.Clive Betts, Labour chairman of the Commons committee, said: ""Parks are treasured public assets, as the overwhelming response to our inquiry demonstrates, but they are at a tipping point and, if we are to prevent a period of decline with potentially severe consequences, then action must be taken.""He said the government had a leadership role to play and volunteers did ""fantastic work"" but the primary responsibility lay with local authorities.The vast majority of councils have cut budgets for parks and were likely to cut further, with Newcastle City Council's parks management budget slashed from £2.589m in 2011/12 to £0.253m in 2016/17, the report found.The government should help councils find innovative ways of managing public parks and green spaces should also be at the heart of planning, the report added."

The government had come under pressure from campaigners and members of the public to take in children from the ""Jungle"" migrant camp in Calais.The legislation required the Home Office to allow ""a specified number"" of vulnerable unaccompanied children into the UK. Lord Dubs and his supporters suggested this number could be as high as 3,000, but the government said the 350 children eventually accepted satisfied the ""intention and spirit"" of the amendment.In a letter to the prime minister, Ms Sturgeon said she found it ""hard to understand why the UK government would even consider the inhumane withdrawal of essential routes to safety"" for vulnerable children.She said: ""The plight of all unaccompanied children demands a resolute and humanitarian approach from all parts of the UK, and other countries, and this departure from the Dubs amendment cuts off a vital route to safety.""The first minister said her government supported a number of other UK commitments to taking in refugees, such as the Syrian Resettlement Programme, and said Scotland ""stands ready"" to help ""provide a place of safety to children in the gravest of situations"".She added: ""I urge you to reverse the shameful decision on the Dubs amendment which cuts off the only reliable and legal route for unaccompanied children arriving from Europe.""We all have a moral duty to do what we can to help those most in need, so I look forward to your earliest response.""The UK government announced it would stop taking in children via the Dubs amendment at the end of March in a written statement at Westminster. Immigration minister Robert Goodwill said 200 children had already arrived, and said 150 more would follow before the end of March, filling the available places offered by local authorities.He said that more than 900 children had been brought to the UK from Calais in total in 2016.Speaking in the House of Commons, Ms Rudd said the government had a ""clear strategy"" and believed it was taking ""the right approach"".She said: ""Here in the UK we have launched the national transfer scheme, and we've also significantly increased funding for local authorities caring for unaccompanied asylum-seeking children by between 20 and 28%.""The government has taken significant steps to improve an already comprehensive approach, and we are providing protection to thousands of children this year. I am proud of this government's active approach to helping and sheltering the most vulnerable, and that is a position which will continue.""Addressing the Dubs scheme directly, she added: ""I am clear that when working with my French counterparts they do not want us to indefinitely continue to accept children under the Dubs amendment because they specify, and I agree with them, that it acts as a draw.""It acts as a pull. It encourages the people traffickers.""Campaigners have sought to challenge the decision in court, saying the consultation process by which Ms Rudd decided on the figure of 350 was ""fundamentally flawed"".At a preliminary hearing at the High Court in London on Friday, judges said they were ""determined"" to move the case forward quickly, setting a provision date for a full hearing in May."

It is hoped 5,700 pupils aged 14 and over will spend up to four hours a week on the subject in a five-year pilot.Classroom and online teaching, ""real-world challenges"" and work experience will be made available from September. A Commons committee last week warned that a skills shortage was undermining confidence in the UK's cyber defences.  The risk that criminals or foreign powers might hack into critical UK computer systems is now ranked as one of the top four threats to national security.  Russia in particular is suspected of planning sustained attacks on Western targets. Cyber security is a fast-growing industry, employing 58,000 experts, the government says, but the Public Accounts Committee has warned it is proving difficult to recruit people with the right skills.  UK's cyber security defences questionedRussian hacks 'aim to destabilise the West'The Department for Culture, Media and Sport is providing £20m for the lessons, which will be designed to fit around pupils' current courses and exams.Digital and Culture Minister Matt Hancock said: ""This forward-thinking programme will see thousands of the best and brightest young minds given the opportunity to learn cutting-edge cyber security skills alongside their secondary school studies. ""We are determined to prepare Britain for the challenges it faces now and in the future and these extra-curricular clubs will help identify and inspire future talent.""The government is already providing university funding and work placements for promising students.An apprenticeship scheme has also begun to support key employers to train and recruit young people aged 16 or over who have a ""natural flair for problem-solving"" and are ""passionate about technology"".Steve Elder, 20, who is a cyber security apprentice with BT, told BBC Radio 5 Live that educating young people about the risks and vulnerabilities of the cyber security world would help the UK prepare for the future. He added: ""Getting young people involved and getting them taught from a young age will allow them - even in their home environment - to protect themselves, before it has to come to people at a specialist level."" Mr Hancock told the BBC he wanted to ensure the UK ""had the pipeline of talent"" it would need.Cyber security expert Brian Lord, a former deputy director at GCHQ, told BBC Breakfast that the scheme was an ""essential initiative"" to recruit more people into the profession. He added: ""There is perception that cyber security is all about techno geeks who have long hair, glasses, wear heavy metal t-shirts and drink red bull. ""There are those, and they do an extraordinarily good job. But there is a whole range of other activities... that can appeal to a wide cross section of children, graduates and apprentices, and at the moment they don't know what [is on] offer.""The more exposure [children] can get [the more it will] prepare them for a future career and, as that generation needs to understand how to be safe online, you get a double benefit.""

""Those under investigation have suffered unacceptable stress, have had their lives put on hold, and their careers damaged,"" it added.Conservative MP Johnny Mercer, a former army captain who chairs the committee, said the process had been ""horrific"" for those involved.""Families torn apart, careers ended, and for what?"" he told BBC Radio 4's PM programme. ""It should have been shut down a long time ago.""The Ministry of Defence had been ""extremely slow off the mark"", he said, and there were a lot of questions to be answered about how it had been allowed to continue for so long. The committee report said there had been a ""catalogue of serious failings"" in the way IHAT handled its investigations.Service personnel and veterans had been contacted unannounced and covert surveillance appeared to have been used on serving and retired members of the armed forces, it said.The report added: ""IHAT investigators have impersonated police officers in order to gain access to military establishments or threaten arrest. Investigations which had previously been closed down were re-opened on the back of dubious evidence.""It said the most telling failure of the unit was the fact there had not been a single prosecution against the UK military.The report went on: ""IHAT has operated without any regard to its impact on the UK military which has directly harmed their reputation across the world, and negatively affected the way this country conducts military operations and defends itself.""The MoD said the department had done its ""utmost"" to support those under investigation, which included funding all their legal costs, providing pastoral support and tackling issues in the legal process.It had been unable to shut down IHAT sooner because the investigations had been under scrutiny by the High Court and the International Criminal Court, it added.A Leigh Day spokesman said it had referred 15 cases to IHAT and would continue to represent individuals against the government.The firm went on to say it would defend itself against allegations made by the Solicitors Regulation Authority when they are heard in a tribunal later in the year.The unit has cost the UK taxpayer £34m so far, but costs were predicted to reach nearly £60m had it remained active until 2019.The department also announced the Royal Military Police would drop around 90% of the abuse cases involving British troops who had served in Afghanistan, many which were brought by Leigh Day.Leigh Day said it had notified the MoD of 80 Afghan citizens who said they had been abused or illegally detained and a number involved allegations of unlawful killings."

I am doing this job because I want NHS care to be the safest and best in the world. That kind of care is completely unacceptable. No-one would want it for members of their own family.""He said there were ""no excuses"" for some of the stories that have emerged this week, including the case of Iris Sibley, who has been left stranded in Bristol Royal Infirmary for more than six months because a nursing home place could not be found for her.""It is terrible for Mrs Sibley but it is also very bad for the NHS,"" Mr Hunt said.He went on to say it was ""completely unacceptable"" - the third time he used the phrase when pressed by the BBC about some of the problems that have come to light.Mr Hunt said: ""We are trying very hard to sort out these problems.""But he admitted progress had been ""disappointingly slow"" in some areas, including integrating the NHS with council-run care services, such as care homes and home help.However, he added: ""Where I disagree with some of your coverage is the idea this is a problem unique to the NHS.""He claimed all health systems were ""grappling"" with similar problems because of the ageing population. ""There's no silver bullet,"" he added.He also took issue with suggestions that it was all about money, pointing out France and Germany, who both spend more than the UK on health, did not do as well as the NHS on 14 out of 35 measures.He said France had struggled this winter with flu, while some German cities had been forced to close their A&Es on ""certain nights"".Mr Hunt said in England extra money was being put in - nearly £4bn this year, which he pointed out was the equivalent to the whole budget of the fire service.While this represents an increase in the front-line budget of nearly 4% this year, since 2010 the NHS has had much less generous rises than it has traditionally enjoyed. That trend is forecast to continue until 2020.He said tackling social care problems - a major reason why so many frail patients cannot be discharged from hospital - was on the government's agenda.""The prime minister has been very clear. We recognise the pressure's there. We recognise there is a problem about the sustainability of the social care system.""That has to be addressed and we are going to do that.""Mr Hunt also said there were ""positive"" things happening in the health service as well as negative, highlighting improvements in cancer survival and the investment being made in general practice.However, Sir Robert Francis said the financial pressures on the NHS - together with the high levels of demand - had created an environment in which a care scandal equal to Mid Staffordshire was ""inevitable"".The health service was ""manifestly failing"" to keep pace with demand, he told the Health Service Journal. Sir Robert, who is a non-executive director at the Care Quality Commission, also warned of ""depressingly familiar"" pressures on NHS chief executives ""coming down from the top.""He said there was an ""increasing disconnect"" between what was said nationally about the NHS and ""what people on the ground feel or see is going on"".""The message is put out that we are putting more money into the service than we ever did and it is the best health service around.""But against that there is a front-line feeling that things have never been as bad as they are now and we can't deal with the pressures,"" he added.Labour Shadow Health Secretary Jon Ashworth said: ""A few weeks ago the prime minister was glibly dismissing concerns as amounting to nothing more than a 'small number of incidents'. ""I'm pleased the secretary of state is waking up to the scale of the crisis.""He urged the government to make more money available to put the NHS and social care on a ""sustainable footing"".Read more from NickFollow Nick on TwitterA week of coverage by BBC News examining the state of the NHS across the UK as it comes under intense pressure during its busiest time of the year."
2017-02-11,Council tax bills set to rise in England,https://web.archive.org//web/20170212031033/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38929869,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkScores of local authorities in England plan to increase council tax by up to 5% in 2017-8, according to research. The Local Government Information Unit said 94% of the 131 councils it spoke to were intending to put up bills, with their finances at ""breaking point"". A third of these, 34% in total, intend to hike bills by more than 2% in April. Councils, many of whom have frozen bills in recent years, say it will not be enough to plug the funding ""gap"" exacerbated by the cost of social care.But the government says council tax is expected to be lower in real terms at the end of this Parliament than it was in 2010.Although councils in Wales were included in the survey, the Welsh government has said it will not allow councils to raise bills to pay for social care. Ministers say they are bringing forward money to help councils pay for social care by increasing the ""precept"" - a supplement that councils are able to charge on bills - from 2% to 5% over the next two years. Years of cuts to central government funding since 2011 have put pressure on the budgets of the 375 councils in England and Wales, with many paring back core services. Financial pressures on county councils and unitary authorities that provide adult social care have become particularly acute in the past year.Surrey County Council abandoned controversial plans this week to hold a referendum on a 15% rise in council tax which it said was needed to pay for social care. It will now increase bills by 4.99% - the maximum it can do without holding a public vote.Labour have accused the government of doing a sweetheart deal with the Tory-controlled council to call off the referendum - claims it denies.Publishing its research, the Local Government Information Unit said five district councils which do not provide social care had wanted to hold local referendums to sanction council tax rises above 2% but had ""thought better"" of it in recent weeks.Inflation, as measured by the CPI index, currently stands at 1.6% but is projected to rise to 2.7% next year. The LGIU said there was growing concern in town halls that the current system of funding local authorities - through a mixture of government grants, council tax and other income streams such as business rates and parking charges - would become unsustainable in the near future.Of the 163 council chiefs - across 131 local authorities - which responded to its survey, 42% said future cuts would be ""noticed"" by residents while one in 10 feared the situation might become so serious that they would no longer be able to fulfil their councils' legal obligations to provide certain services. A number of county councils - including Newcastle, North Tyneside, South Tyneside and Sunderland - have already said they will add the full 3% ""social care precept"" to council tax bills next year and many others are expected to follow suit. Jonathan Carr-West, chief executive of the LGIU, said: ""Local government finances are at breaking point.""""We see councils around the country patching their budgets by raising council tax, drawing on their reserves and increasing charging. They have very little confidence in the sustainability of the system.""Councils are allowed to place a 3% precept on council tax to fund adult social care - nine out of 10 of them saying it is not enough money and won't meet the gap. Councils are going to retain 100% of the new business rates - half of councils tell us they think they will be worse off under that new system post-2020.""He said councils were being frustrated in their efforts to address the problems themselves with revenue-raising measures such as greater scope for charging, local hotel taxes and a re-evaluation of council tax bands ""off the government's agenda"".""None of these are wild and wacky ideas. They are things that are done in other countries, in the US, France and Spain and they work. ""Here they are not even part of the conversation. That needs to change.""A spokesman for the Department of Communities and Local Government said: ""Council tax is expected to be lower in real terms at the end of this Parliament than it was in 2010 and we've protected residents by allowing them to veto excessive rises at a local referendum.""Our historic four-year funding settlement gives local authorities the certainty they need to plan ahead, with almost £200bn available to provide the services that local people most value. ""We've also announced an additional £900m for social care, meaning councils will have £7.6bn of dedicated funding to spend over the four years."" "
2017-02-11,Child refugees 'at risk of being killed',https://web.archive.org//web/20170212031033/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-38926955,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkChild refugees will be at risk of being exploited, trafficked and even killed following the government's decision to end the ""Dubs amendment"" scheme, the Archbishop of Canterbury has warned.His criticism comes as campaigners challenge ministers over the number of vulnerable children accepted by the UK at a High Court hearing.They say ministers have not worked with local councils to find enough places.Ministers argue the arrangement is ""a pull"" for children and traffickers.The Most Reverend Justin Welby previously said he was ""shocked and saddened"" at the government's announcement that only 350 children would be accepted into the UK under the Dubs scheme.Speaking to BBC Radio 4's World at One, he added: ""Parents do not casually wake up one day and say the easiest thing to do is send our children off by themselves.""This is the symptom of a situation more extreme than anything any of us can imagine and at some point the vulnerability of these children must be recognised - the alternative is they will be trafficked.""It's not going to stop them being trafficked, and they will end up in brothels, they will end up in places they will be exploited, ill-treated, manipulated and very often finally killed.""The archbishop said there was not a ""simple approach"" to the refugee crisis but ""to leave the whole weight on Italy and Greece is deeply unjust"".On Wednesday the government ended the Dubs amendment scheme, designed by the Labour peer and former child refugee, Lord Dubs.The amendment, which was attached to the Immigration Act last year, required the Home Office to allow some of the most vulnerable unaccompanied children stranded in Europe into the UK.However, refugee groups and charities have previously accused the government of dragging its feet on the issue. The legal action by the charity Help Refugees, begun before the government's announcement on Wednesday, argues that ministers have failed to work hard enough to find sufficient places for the children.Campaigners say the consultation process by which the Home Secretary Amber Rudd decided only 350 would be accepted was ""fundamentally flawed"".At a preliminary hearing in London on Friday, Mr Justice Holman said he was ""determined"" the case should move forward quickly and a provisional date for a full hearing was set for May.Meanwhile, the daughter of the man called ""Britain's Schindler"" has criticised the ending of the Dubs scheme.Barbara Winton, daughter of Sir Nicholas Winton - who helped save hundreds of children from the Nazis in World War Two - has called on the prime minister to reinstate the Dubs amendment.In a letter to Theresa May, she said her father had said the UK had ""a responsibility to offer sanctuary to those fleeing persecution"".Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, she said she wanted to ""remind"" the prime minister of the words Mrs May had used at a memorial to Sir Nicholas, that she hoped his life would ""encourage us to do the right thing"".Ms Winton said children in migrant camps in Europe were ""suffering really difficult situations"" and were alone.""I would say that rather than honouring what my father did 80 years ago by just talking about that, the best way to honour him is to do what he would do now and that is help as many children as possible,"" she added. Ministers say 350 children will have arrived under the scheme by the time it ends in March, but have highlighted fears that it encourages people traffickers.Lord Dubs and his supporters have suggested the UK could help 3,000 of the most vulnerable children.On Thursday, church leaders, charities, MPs and peers also condemned the decision to close the scheme.Lord Dubs said: ""I believe, in arbitrarily closing down the scheme without any good reason for doing so, the government is in breach of its own commitments.""Home Secretary Amber Rudd defended the approach to the Dubs scheme - saying UK and French authorities feared it had provided opportunities for people traffickers.Speaking in the Commons, she said: ""I am clear that when working with my French counterparts they do not want us to indefinitely continue to accept children under the Dubs amendment because they specify, and I agree with them, that it acts as a draw.""It acts as a pull. It encourages the people traffickers.""The Home Office has insisted it is not giving up on vulnerable children and youngsters will continue to arrive from around the world through other resettlement schemes and the asylum system."
2017-02-11,Germany warns the City over Brexit risk,https://web.archive.org//web/20170212031033/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-38925440,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkOne of Germany's most senior banking regulators has warned London that it is likely to lose its role as ""the gateway to Europe"" for vital financial services.Dr Andreas Dombret, executive board member for the German central bank, the Bundesbank, said that even if banking rules were ""equivalent"" between the UK and the rest of the European Union, that was ""miles away from access to the single market"".Mr Dombret's comments were made at a private meeting of German businesses and banks organised by Boston Consulting Group in Frankfurt earlier this week.They give a clear - and rare - insight into Germany's approach as Britain starts the process of leaving the European Union.And that approach is hawkish.""The current model of using London as a gateway to Europe is likely to end,"" Mr Dombret said at the closed-door event.Mr Dombret made it clear that he did not support a ""confrontational approach"" to future relations between the UK's substantial financial services sector and the EU.But he argued there was ""intense uncertainty"" about how the Brexit negotiations would progress and significant hurdles to overcome.The Bundesbank executive, who is responsible for banking and financial supervision, said he was concerned that the trend towards internationally agreed standards was under pressure.And that Britain might try to become the ""Singapore of Europe"" following Brexit, by cutting taxes and relaxing financial regulations to encourage banks and businesses to invest in the UK.""Brexit fits into a certain trend we are seeing towards renationalisation,"" he said.""I strongly believe that this negatively affects the well-being of us all.""We should therefore invest all our efforts in containing these trends.""This holds for the private sector as well as for supervisors and policymakers in the EU and the UK.""Some voices are calling for deregulation after Brexit,"" he continued.""One such example is the 'financial centre strategy' that is being discussed as a fallback option for the City of London.""Parts of this recipe are low corporate taxes and loose financial regulation.""We should not forget that strictly supervised and well-capitalised financial systems are the most successful ones in the long run.""The EU will not engage in a regulatory race to the bottom.""At present, London operates as the financial services capital for the EU.More than a third of all wholesale banking between larger businesses, governments and pension funds takes place in Britain.Nearly 80% of all foreign exchange transactions in the EU are carried out in the UK.The business is valued in trillions of pounds, with billions of pounds being traded every day to insure companies, for example, against interest rate changes, currency fluctuations and inflation risk.If there were significant changes to the present free-trading relationship between Britain and the EU, that could have a major impact on the value of the financial services to the UK and on the one million people employed in the sector.Mr Dombret said it would also have an impact on German businesses which use London as a source of funding.Some banks are hoping that, with the government looking to fully leave the single market, an ""equivalence regime"" can be agreed where the UK and the EU recognise each other's regulatory standards.That would allow cross-border transactions to continue with few regulatory hurdles.But Mr Dombret said that equivalence had ""major drawbacks"" and was not an ""ideal substitute"".""I am very sceptical about whether equivalence decisions offer a sound footing for banks' long-term location decisions,"" he said.""Equivalence is miles away from single market access.""Equivalence decisions are reversible, so banks would be forced to adjust to a new environment in the event that supervisory frameworks are no longer deemed equivalent.""These lead to the overall conclusion that equivalence decisions are no ideal substitute for passporting [which allows banks in one EU country to operate in another as part of the single market].""Whatever the arrangements, Mr Dombret said that a ""transition period"" would ease the pressure of change and reduce what he described as the ""earnings risk"".""Let me say that I expect London to remain an important financial centre,"" Mr Dombret told the audience.""Nevertheless, I also expect many UK-based market participants to move at least some business units to the EU in order to hedge against all possible outcomes of the negotiations.""One of the biggest EU-focused businesses in the UK is euro-denominated clearing - insurance products called derivatives, which allow companies to protect themselves from movements in currencies, interest rates and inflation.Three-quarters of the multi-trillion-pounds-a-day market is executed in London and a recent report from the accountancy firm EY estimated that nearly 83,000 jobs could be lost in Britain over the next seven years if clearing has to move to an EU member state following Brexit.Mr Dombret said it was difficult to see how euro-clearing could remain in London, as it depended on the ""acceptance of the European Court of Justice"" as the arbiter of the thousands of legal contracts signed between counter-parties, many of which last for years.Britain has made it clear that it does not want to be bound by ECJ judgements once it has left the EU.""I see strong arguments for having the bulk of the clearing business inside the euro area,"" Mr Dombret said."
2017-02-11,Corbyn reshuffles shadow cabinet,https://web.archive.org//web/20170212031033/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38925552,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn has appointed Rebecca Long-Bailey as shadow business secretary, as he reshuffled the shadow cabinet.Sue Hayman takes the environment, food and rural affairs brief, while Christina Rees becomes shadow Welsh secretary.The new shadow chief secretary to the Treasury is Peter Dowd.The business brief became vacant when Clive Lewis resigned on Wednesday to oppose his party in the Brexit vote.Other shadow cabinet members remain in place.4Shadow Cabinet re-shuffles in 18 months32  resignations, of whom... 4 later returned to top positions  4 of those who quit, did so to vote against the Brexit Bill The four newly-promoted MPs are all part of the party's 2015 intake. Ms Long-Bailey, MP for Salford and Eccles, was previously shadow chief secretary to the Treasury and was described by Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell as a ""brilliant"" member of the ""next generation of our socialist leadership team"" last week. Ms Hayman, MP for Workington in West Cumbria, was a shadow environment minister before her promotion, while Ms Rees, MP for Neath, was a shadow justice minister. Mr Dowd is MP for Bootle.Ms Rees and Ms Hayman both nominated Owen Smith in his unsuccessful challenge to Mr Corbyn's leadership in 2016.There are now 14 women in Mr Corbyn's 29-member shadow cabinet.The Labour Party said that more junior shadow ministerial roles would be filled ""in due course"".What is striking about this announcement is not who has been appointed, and to which job - it is the leadership's approach to the frontbenchers among the 52 Labour rebels who defied Jeremy Corbyn in last night's vote on Brexit. Most of them tonight are still in a job, despite abandoning the collective responsibility of the party's official position and ignoring their leader. I understand it's unlikely there will be any sackings. This in itself is extraordinary, not least because among the rebels were three whips, the very people responsible for party discipline. It illustrates what you might call Jeremy Corbyn's human resources challenge. When you discount those who won't serve under him, and those who have but no longer do, his options are limited.Mr Lewis announced his resignation from the party's front bench as MPs began voting for the final time on the Brexit bill on Wednesday.In a letter to Mr Corbyn, he wrote that he was leaving the shadow cabinet ""with a very heavy heart"", but Labour had not won ""the protections the people of this country need"" during the Commons debates on Brexit.Asked on the BBC about Mr Lewis's departure, Mr Corbyn said: ""It's not a disaster. ""The majority of Labour MPs voted to trigger Article 50. Fifty-odd voted against it, mainly on the basis of their strong message from their own constituents.""Labour's chief whip Nick Brown will handle any disciplinary action to be taken against the 52 Labour MPs who rebelled against the party line and voted against the Brexit bill on Wednesday."

2017-02-11,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20170212031033/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThis article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide to the UK's vote to leave the European Union. It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 52% to 48%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%, as did Wales, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who resigned on the day after losing the referendum. Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she says she will respect the will of the people. She has said ""Brexit means Brexit"" but there is still a lot of debate about what that will mean in practice especially on the two key issues of how British firms do business in the European Union and what curbs are brought in on the rights of European Union nationals to live and work in the UK. She set out more details of her negotiating hopes in her key speech on Brexit.The UK economy appears to have weathered the initial shock of the Brexit vote, although the value of the pound remains near a 30-year low, but opinion is sharply divided over the long-term effects of leaving the EU. Some major firms such as Easyjet and John Lewis have pointed out that the slump in sterling has increased their costs. Britain also lost its top AAA credit rating, meaning the cost of government borrowing will be higher. But share prices have recovered from a dramatic slump in value, with both the FTSE 100 and the broader FTSE 250 index, which includes more British-based businesses, trading higher than before the referendum. The Bank of England cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - a record low and the first cut since 2009 - after the vote and there has not been the economic slump or recession that some had predicted. Here is a regularly updated detailed rundown of how Britain's economy is doingThe European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it has to invoke an agreement called Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May has said she intends to trigger this process by the end of March 2017, meaning the UK will be expected to have left by the summer of 2019, depending on the precise timetable agreed during the negotiations. The government will also enact a Great Repeal Bill which will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. It is expected to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove.After a court battle, the UK's Supreme Court has ruled that Parliament must be consulted before Article 50 is invoked. This is why a two line Brexit bill is currently making its way through Parliament. MPs and Lords have to vote on it.The court verdict was not what the government argued for, but ministers have insisted it will not delay their planned timetable.Most MPs are expected to vote in favour of Article 50 being triggered, although there could be attempts to amend the draft legislation.Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These men - dubbed the Three Brexiteers - will play a central role in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although it will be Mrs May, as prime minister, who will have the final say. The government did not do any emergency planning for Brexit ahead of the referendum and Mrs May has rejected calls to say what her negotiating goals are.Once Article 50 has been triggered, the UK will have two years to negotiate its withdrawal. But no one really knows how the Brexit process will work - Article 50 was only created in late 2009 and it has never been used. Former Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, now Chancellor, wanted Britain to remain in the EU, and he has suggested it could take up to six years for the UK to complete exit negotiations. The terms of Britain's exit will have to be agreed by 27 national parliaments, a process which could take some years, he has argued. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. The UK will continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making.Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Following Theresa May's Brexit recent speech we now know that the UK is not intending to stay in the EU's single market. Although there has been speculation for months about the issue, it would have meant the UK staying under the auspices of the European Court of Justice and having to allow unlimited EU immigration, under freedom of movement rules.Both sides want trade to continue after Brexit with the UK seeking a positive outcome for those who wish to trade goods and services"" - such as those in the City of London and wanting a ""comprehensive free trade deal"" giving the UK ""the greatest possible access"" to the single market. Mrs May says she wants the UK to reach a new customs union deal with the EU. A customs union is where countries agree not to impose tariffs on each others' goods and have a common tariff on goods coming in from elsewhere. The UK is currently part of the EU customs union but that stops the UK being able to do its own trade deals with other countries. Reality Check: How could customs union work?These terms have increasingly been used as debate focused on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people in order to maintain access to the EU single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result.The government has declined to give a firm guarantee about the status of EU nationals currently living in the UK, saying this is not possible without a reciprocal pledge from other EU members about the millions of British nationals living on the continent. EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, will be be able to stay, the chief civil servant at the Home Office has said. The rights of other EU nationals would be subject to negotiations on Brexit and the ""will of Parliament"", he added.A lot depends on the kind of deal the UK agrees with the EU. If it remains within the single market, it would almost certainly retain free movement rights, allowing UK citizens to work in the EU and vice versa. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.Again, it depends on whether the UK government decides to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages. Citizens' Advice has reminded people their rights have not changed yet and asked anyone to contact them if they think they have been discriminated against following the Leave vote.Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested EU migrants who come to the UK as Brexit nears may not be given the right to stay. He has said there might have to be a cut-off point if there was a ""surge"" in new arrivals.People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote.The day-to-day spending impact is likely to be more significant. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it to remain at least 10% below where it was on 23 June, in the long term. This means imported goods will consequently get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have already been seen and the issue was most notably illustrated by the dispute between Tesco and Marmite's makers about whether prices would be put up or not in the stores.The latest UK inflation figures, for December, showed the CPI inflation rate jumping to 1.6%, its highest level for two years with signs of more cost pressures set to feed through in the months to come.Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration.She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations. As mentioned above, the key issue is whether other EU nations will grant the UK access to the single market, if that is what it wants, while at the same time being allowed to restrict the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK.Mrs May has said she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. It is currently running at 330,000 a year, of which 184,000 are EU citizens, and 188,000 are from outside the EU - the figures include a 39,000 outflow of UK citizens.It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Liberal Democrats - who have just a handful of MPs - have vowed to halt Brexit and keep Britain in the EU if they were to win the next general election.Some commentators, including former House of Commons clerk Lord Lisvane, have argued that a further referendum would be needed to ratify whatever deal the UK hammers out with the EU, but there are few signs political leaders view this as a viable option.Yes. Theresa May has appeared keen to avoid a vote on her negotiating stance, to avoid having to give away her priorities, but Theresa May has said there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. It is worth mentioning that any deal also has to be agreed by the European Parliament - with British MEPs getting a chance to vote on it there.  While there could be limitations on British nationals' ability to live and work in EU countries, it seems unlikely they would want to deter tourists. There are many countries outside the European Economic Area, which includes the 28 EU nations plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway, that British citizens can visit for up to 90 days without needing a visa and it is possible that such arrangements could be negotiated with European countries.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. In theory, the government could, if it wanted, decide to change the colour, which is currently standardised for EU countries, says the BBC's Europe correspondent, Chris Morris.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketNo nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it is ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faces being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. A second independence referendum for the country is now ""highly likely"", she has said, although not in 2017. She has said she wants Scotland to stay in the single market and said Mrs May's decision to rule out the UK staying in the single market ""undoubtedly"" brings the referendum closer.Before his resignation Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said the impact in Northern Ireland would be ""very profound"" and that the whole island of Ireland should now be able to vote on reunification. But, speaking while she was still Northern Ireland Secretary, Theresa Villiers ruled out the call from Sinn Féin for a border poll, saying the circumstances in which one would be called did not exist. The land border is likely to be a key part of the Brexit talks. Theresa May said a priority for her would be negotiating a deal with the EU which allowed a common travel area between the UK and the Republic of Ireland.During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest. But his successor Theresa May has said she will keep it in place, at least for the current Parliament, which is due to last until 2020.So far there has been a cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. There are yet to be signs that rising inflation have worried the Bank of England  enough to consider raising interest rates.  But if that happened it would make mortgages and loans more expensive to repay - but would be good news for savers.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.Eurotunnel boss Jacques Gounon said last November the reintroduction of duty-free would be ""an incredible boost for my business"" but he later said  that remark had been ""light-hearted"". Erik Juul-Mortensen, president of the Tax Free World Association (TFWA) said after the referendum vote ""it is not possible to predict how Brexit will affect the duty free and travel retail industry, and it is wiser not to make assumptions about exactly what the impact will be.""  They are at the moment but no-one knows the longer term prospects for definite. The EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - is not an EU initiative. It was negotiated between countries within a group known as the European Economic Area, often simply referred to as the single market (plus Switzerland, which confusingly is not a member of the EEA, but has agreed access to the single market). Therefore, the future of Britons' EHIC cover could depend on whether the UK decided to sever ties with the EEA.Probably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report. In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two-thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.However, the UK government is committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, the UK government is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR. However, the EU has its own European Court of Justice, whose decisions are binding on EU institutions and member states.Its rulings have sometimes caused controversy in Britain and supporters of a Brexit have called for immediate legislation to curb its powers. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also cited sovereignty and democracy, and they wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Four of the biggest US banks have committed to helping maintain the City's position. But HSBC will move up to 1,000 jobs to Paris, the BBC understands. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Pest control firm Rentokil Initial says it could make £15m extra this year thanks to a weaker currency.Others are less optimistic. Hilary Jones, a director at UK cosmetics firm Lush said the company was ""terrified"" about the economic impact. She added that while the firm's Dorset factory would continue to produce goods for the UK market, products for the European market may be made at its new plant in Germany.Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After the Leave vote, the government will probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""As with most elements of the UK economy, not enough solid data has been published yet to accurately conclude the Brexit effect on house prices. Industry figures have pointed to ""uncertainty"" among buyers and sellers that could potentially change the housing market.So far, the most significant research has come from the respected Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which has published the conclusions of a survey of its members. This primarily records sentiment among surveyors.It found that house prices are expected to fall across the UK in the three months after the referendum vote. However, the dip in prices is only expected to persist over the 12 months from June in London and East Anglia, surveyors predict.House prices were already slowing in central London, owing to the fall-out from changes to stamp duty rules in April.Separate figures from property portal Rightmove suggested the average asking price of houses coming on to the market in England and Wales fell by 0.9%, or £2,647, in July compared with June. It said that agents had reported very few sales had fallen through as a result of the vote.Many potential first-time buyers would welcome a fall in house prices, with ownership among the young falling owing to affordability concerns. Investors in property, or those who have paid off a mortgage and hope to leave homes as inheritance would be unhappy with a long-term reduction in value.  Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law following the decision to leave the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" will not necessarily disappear overnight - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU means the UK will not be part of TTIP. It will have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Former Labour health secretary Lord Owen has said that because of TTIP (see answer above) the only way to protect the NHS from further privatisation was to get out of the EU."

I don't think so. The coverage of one MP's Early Day Motion (EDM) of no confidence in the Speaker, in the wake of his comments about President Trump, is massively over-egged. First, it's an EDM. They are a form of parliamentary graffiti - a way of expressing an opinion, and nestling amongst the 946 EDMs on such subjects as the Queen's sapphire jubilee, diplomatic relations with Armenia, the Battle of Cable St and organised dog fighting, it has so far attracted a single signature - although that might change when MPs return from their holidays. But the more important point about EDMs is that some special parliamentary acrobatics are needed for them to be debated on the floor of the Commons. The government could provide the time, but it won't. An opposition party could give up some of its allocated time, but they won't. The Backbench Business Committee, which controls its own block of Commons time, could allocate a slot - but it almost certainly won't.So no debate. But what if a large number of MPs do, eventually, sign it? Will a shamed Speaker Bercow retire to his state dining room with a bottle of his own-brand whisky and a loaded revolver? I strongly doubt it. This Speaker saw off a coup attempt on the last day of the 2010 Parliament, when the coalition whips attempted to change the rules on Speaker elections as a precursor to an attempt to unseat him after the general election. That vote was effectively a direct attack on the Speaker - and was supported by 202 MPs. Yet Speaker Bercow did not resign. Like another Marmite politician, he's a fighter, not a quitter. And no-one should make the mistake of assuming he is universally loathed by Tory MPs. The Bercow phenomenon is a complex thing. On the one hand, he's a hardline parliamentary moderniser. On a cosmetic level, he has ditched the grand gold-embroidered robes worn by his predecessors, and most recently, presided over the decision to abandon the court dress worn by the Commons Clerks. But more importantly, he has opened up the procedure of the House, with historically important results.A few months back I wrote about how his rulings provided the parliamentary openings that led to pro-Brexit MPs cornering David Cameron into conceding the EU referendum. But he has also allowed 353 Urgent Questions, putting ministers on the spot on topical issues, so that the Commons is visible on the TV news, debating the issues of the moment. In the 21st Century that is essential. MPs also appreciate his brisk conduct of question times, giving many more their moment in the Parliamentary limelight.But then there's the other side of the coin. His put-downs can be brutal, and Tory MPs believe he targets them more often than the opposition - although the Lib Dems, still smarting from the duffing up of their leader, Tim Farron, at PMQs the other week, might argue that they get swatted too. Where other Speakers might have poured on a little honey ""the Right Hon Gentleman who is a distinguished parliamentarian, should know better…"", Bercow's repartee - like his admonition to Tory Tim Loughton ""the children's minister should stop acting like a child"" - has not been forgotten or forgiven by its targets. His stand-up shouting match with the then government Chief Whip, Patrick McLoughlin, on the floor of the Commons, may be the most spectacular example of a loss of temper, but it's not the only one. To quote Kipling, the burnt Speaker's bandaged finger goes wabbling back to the fire. But there are plenty of reasons why I expect him to survive. First there is no Commons majority to remove him. Support for the Speaker may be the love that dare not speak its name in the Conservative 1922 Committee, but there is a solid phalanx of Bercow-supporting Tories out there. As one senior member of this elusive group put it, ""with this Speaker, you have to take the rough with the smooth"". They believe his failings are a price worth paying for a Speaker who they believe facilitates tough scrutiny of the government.Second, the government has learned the lesson of its attempt to remove him on 26 March 2015, and doesn't want to place its dabs on the dagger this time. And without a government whipping operation behind it, any direct attempt to topple the Speaker is doomed.Third, MPs want to protect the Office. This is a more subtle point. If the Speaker is to be dethroned, his successor will feel vulnerable from day one. They will be less willing to offend, not just ministers, but pretty much anyone. And that means the rights of individual MPs and backbench groupings like the pre-referendum Brexiteers to make life difficult, may be less diligently enforced. This argument convinces a lot of older hands who are not obvious Bercow backers on other grounds.Fourth, he's going anyway. Perhaps later in this Parliament than some may hope, but he's been in the Chair since 2009, and that's a pretty long spell. So why mount a putsch when success is not guaranteed and there's a price to be paid?So when the Bercow era does end, it will be at a time of his choosing."
2017-02-11,Peering ahead,https://web.archive.org//web/20170212031033/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38918526,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkSharpen your pencils. Now Theresa May has her prize from the Commons, getting the Article 50 bill (she never wanted) through with no major changes, it makes its way to the red and gold end of the Palace of Westminster, to the Lords.The first debate is set for 20 February. More than 140 Peers have already put their names down to speak. But at that stage there probably won't be a vote. A week later the thornier more detailed committee stage begins. Then the last certain stage, the third reading and report is scheduled for 7 March. If it all goes according to the government's plan, which sources say is ""hugely unpredictable"", it would allow Theresa May to stick to her timetable and push the button for exit talks to start the next week, once the Bill has been rubber-stamped by the other Palace. (It's daft in this business to make too many predictions, but I d put a fiver on that happening on Wednesday 15 March.)The government will have a bumpier ride in the Lords after a grumpy process in the Commons. The Lords is dramatically different because the government most certainly does not have a majority among peers. And, it is the Lords' express purpose to scrutinise and if needed, improve draft laws before sending them back along the corridor to the Commons.Overnight a government source suggested that the Lords had better jolly well let the Brexit bill go through, or else. Despite the sabre-rattling though, the atmosphere in the Lords is less febrile than that language might suggest.Downing Street this morning tried to dampen down the aggressive briefing. And one source in the Lords described the threat as ""total BS"" - I'll leave you to work that out.The main opposition leader, Baroness Smith, has made it plain on several occasions that although the Lords may try to tweak the Bill, Labour, broadly, has no intention of trying to block it. Her modus operandi is to ""hold to account, not hold to ransom"".The Liberal Democrats are more intent on making changes in the Lords, for it is there they can wield power, rather than in the Commons. But unless they have the support of Labour too, there is a limit to how much trouble they can cause.The chatter suggests the Lords will push for concessions from the government over the rights of EU citizens to stay here, reporting the progress of negotiations regularly to Parliament and maybe on a final ""meaningful vote"" for both Houses on the deal.It will be up to the government to decide whether to tweak the bill slightly as they did in the Commons or risk some defeats. Insiders predict it is likely the Lords may end up sending back the bill to the Commons once, as ""ping pong"" to force the government to make a change or two. But even senior Lib Dem sources don't expect hostile stand-offs for weeks on end. The Lords will make their voices heard, there is no question about that and the Article 50 bill could run into trouble. It would be wrong to suggest that ministers don't anticipate a tricky time. But today at least, whatever the sabre-rattling from some parts of government, this historic piece of legislation looks likely to be the subject of a few skirmishes in the Lords, rather than an apocalyptic battle.

2017-02-11,Ward-by ward,https://web.archive.org//web/20170212031033/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38762034,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe BBC has obtained a more localised breakdown of votes from nearly half of the local authorities which counted EU referendum ballots last June.This information provides much greater depth and detail in explaining the pattern of how the UK voted. The key findings are:A statistical analysis of the data obtained for over a thousand individual local government wards confirms how the strength of the local Leave vote was strongly associated with lower educational qualifications.Wards where the population had fewer qualifications tended to have a higher Leave vote, as shown in the chart. If the proportion of the local electorate with a degree or similar qualification was one percentage point lower, then on average the leave vote was higher by nearly one percentage point.Using ward-level data means we can compare voting figures in this way to the local demographic information collected in the 2011 census. Of the main census statistics, this is the one with the greatest association with how people voted. In statistical terms the level of educational qualifications explains about two-thirds of the variation in the results between different wards. The correlation is strong, whether based on assessing graduate and equivalent qualifications or lower-level ones. This ward-by-ward analysis covers 1,070 individual wards in England and Wales whose boundaries had not changed since the 2011 census, about one in nine of the UK's wards. We had very little ward-level data from Scotland, and none from Northern Ireland.It should be noted, however, that many ward counts also included some postal votes from across the counting area, and therefore some variation between wards will have been masked by the random allocation of postal votes for counting. This makes the results less accurate geographically, but we can still use the information to explore broad national and local patterns.  Adding age as a second factor significantly helps to further explain voting patterns. Older populations were more likely to vote Leave. Education and age combined account for nearly 80% of the voting variation between wards. Ethnicity is a smaller factor, but one which also contributed to the results. Adding that in means that now 83% of the variation in the vote between wards is explained. White populations were generally more pro-Leave, and ethnic minorities less so.  However, there were some interesting differences between London and elsewhere.The ethnic dimension is particularly interesting when examining the outliers on the graph that compares the Leave vote to levels of education.There are numerous wards towards the bottom left of the graph where electorates with lower educational qualifications nevertheless produced low Leave and high Remain votes. This is where the link between low qualifications and Leave voting breaks down. It turns out that these exceptional wards have high ethnic minority populations, particularly in Birmingham and Haringey in north London. In contrast, there are virtually no dramatic outliers on the other side of the line, where comparatively highly educated populations voted Leave. Only one point on the graph stands out - this is Osterley and Spring Grove in Hounslow, west London, a mainly ethnic minority ward which had a Leave vote of 63%. While this figure does include some postal votes, they are not nearly enough to explain away this unusual outcome.In fact, in Ealing and Hounslow, west London boroughs with many voters of Asian origin, the ethnic correlation was in the other direction to the national picture: a higher number of Asian voters was associated with a higher Leave vote.This powerful link to educational attainment could stem from the lower qualified tending to feel less confident about their prospects and ability to compete for work in a competitive globalised economy with high levels of migration. On the other hand some commentators see it as primarily reflecting a ""culture war"" or ""values conflict"", rather than issues of economics and inequality. Research shows that non-graduates tend to take less liberal positions than graduates on a range of social issues from immigration and multi-culturalism to the death penalty.   The former campaign director of Vote Leave, Dominic Cummings, argues that the better educated are more prone to holding irrational political opinions because they are more driven by fashion and a group mentality. Of course this assessment does not imply that Leave voters were almost all poorly educated and old, and Remain voters well educated and young. The Leave side obviously attracted support from many middle class professionals, graduates and younger people. Otherwise it couldn't have won. While there was undoubtedly a lot of voting which cut across these criteria, the point of this analysis is to explore how different social groups most probably voted - and it is clear that education, age and ethnicity were crucial influences.  After these three key factors are taken into account, adding in further demographic measures from the census does little to increase the explanation of UK-wide voting patterns. However, this does not reflect the distinctively more pro-Remain voting in Scotland, since we are short of Scottish data at this geographical level. It is clear as well that in a few specific locations high student numbers were also very relevant. To a certain extent, using the level of educational qualifications as a measure combines both class and age factors, with working class and older adults both tending to be less well qualified.But the association between education and the voting results is stronger than the association between social or occupational class and the results. This is still true after taking the age of the local population into account.This suggests that voters with lower qualifications were more likely to back Leave than the better qualified, even when they were in the same social or occupational class.The existence of a significant connection between Leave voting and lower educational qualifications had already been suggested by analysis of the published referendum results from the official counting areas.The data we have obtained strengthens this conclusion, because voting patterns can now be compared to social statistics from the 2011 census at a much more detailed geographical level than by the earlier studies. The BBC analysis is also consistent with opinion polling (for example, from Lord Ashcroft, Ipsos Mori and YouGov) that tried to identify the characteristics of Leave and Remain voters.  The data we have collected can be used to illustrate the sort of places where the Leave and Remain camps did particularly well: it is hard to imagine a more glaring social contrast than that between the deprived, poorly educated housing estates of Brambles and Thorntree in Middlesbrough, and the privileged elite colleges of Market ward in central Cambridge. It is important to bear in mind, however, that most of the voting figures mentioned below also include some postal votes, so they should be treated as approximate rather than precise.  It is also important to note that the examples are limited to the places for which we were able to obtain localised information, which was only a minority of areas. The rest of the country may well contain even starker instances.Of the 1,283 individual wards for which we have data, the highest Leave vote was 82.5% in Brambles and Thorntree, a section of east Middlesbrough with many social problems. Ward boundaries have changed since the 2011 census, but in that survey the Thorntree part of the area had the lowest proportion of people with a degree or similar qualification of anywhere in England and Wales, at only 5%. And according to Middlesbrough council, the figure for the current Brambles and Thorntree ward is even lower, at just 4%. Second highest was 80.3% in Waterlees Village, a poor locality within Wisbech, Cambridgeshire. This area has seen a major influx of East European migrants who have been doing low-paid work in nearby food processing factories and farms, with tensions between them and British residents. Other wards with available data which had the strongest Leave votes were congregated in Middlesbrough, Canvey Island in Essex, Skegness in coastal Lincolnshire, and Havering in east London.The highest Remain vote was 87.8% in Market ward in central Cambridge, an area with numerous colleges and a high student population, in a city which was strongly pro-Remain.This was followed by Ashley ward  (85.6%) in central Bristol, a district featuring ethnic diversity, gentrification and alternative culture.Next highest was Northumberland Park (85.0%) in Haringey, north London, which has a substantial black population. Other wards with available data which had the strongest Remain votes were generally located in Cambridge, Bristol and the multi-ethnic London boroughs of Haringey and Lambeth. The count for Ashburton in Croydon, south London, split 50-50 exactly, with both Leave and Remain getting 3,885 votes, but that did include some postal ballots.As for being nearest to the overall result, the combined count of Tulketh and University, neighbouring wards near the centre of Preston, was 51.92% for leave, very close to the UK wide figure of 51.89%. The individual ward of Barnwood in Gloucester had Leave at 51.94%. Both figures however contain some postal votes.Given that a few councils provided even more detailed data down to the level of polling districts, it is possible to identify some very small localities that were nicely representative of the national picture. The 527 voters in the neighbouring districts of Kirk Langley and Mackworth in Amber Valley in Derbyshire, whose two ballot boxes were counted together, produced a leave proportion of 51.99%. And this figure is not contaminated by any postal votes.So journalists (or anyone else for that matter) who seek a microcosm of the UK should perhaps visit the Mundy Arms pub in Mackworth, the location for that district's polling station.Similarly, the 427 voters in the combined neighbouring polling districts of Chiddingstone Hoath and Hever Four Elms to the south of Sevenoaks in Kent delivered a leave vote of 51.6% (again, without any postal votes).The data obtained points to 269 areas of various sizes (wards, clusters of wards or constituencies) which had a different Leave/Remain outcome compared to the official counting area of which they were part.This consists of 150 areas which backed Remain but were part of Leave-voting counting areas; and 119 in the other direction. The detailed information therefore gives us an understanding of how the electorate voted which is more variegated than the officially published results.Every one of Scotland's 32 counting areas came down on the Remain side. Yet, despite the fact that most Scottish councils did not give us much detailed information, we can nevertheless identify a few smaller parts of the country which actually backed Leave.A cluster of six wards in the Banff and Buchan area in north Aberdeenshire had a strong Leave majority of 61%. There is much local discontent within the fishing industry of this coastal district about the EU's common fisheries policy.An Taobh Siar agus Nis, a ward at the northern end of the Isle of Lewis in Na h-Eileanan an Iar (Western Isles), also voted Leave, if very narrowly. And at a smaller geographical level, in Shetland the 567 voters in the combined polling districts of Whalsay and South Unst had an extremely high Leave vote of 81%. The island of Whalsay is a fishing community, where EU rules have been controversial and in 2012 numerous skippers were heavily fined for major breaches of fishing quotas.Ealing and Hounslow are neighbouring multi-ethnic boroughs in the west of London with large Asian populations, where - in contrast to the national picture - non-white ethnicity was associated with voting Leave, particularly in Ealing. Both boroughs shared a varied internal pattern of prosperous largely white areas voting strongly Remain, poorer largely white areas preferring Leave, and the Asian areas tending to be more evenly split.Ealing voted 60% Remain, with Southfield ward hitting 76%, but in contrast the Southall wards which are over 90% ethnic minority were close to 50-50.In Hounslow the richer wards in Chiswick in the east of the area voted heavily Remain (73%), but the poorer largely white wards at the opposite western end in Feltham and Bedfont voted Leave (64-66%). Osterley and Spring Grove was also 63% Leave, the highest Leave vote in any individual ward in the UK with a non-white majority for which we have data. The south London borough of Bromley narrowly voted Remain. Those parts which did not do so by a significant margin were the Cray Valley wards, largely poor white working class areas; and Biggin Hill and Darwin wards, locations to the south which contain more open countryside and lie outside the built-up commuter belt. In Croydon in south London, places which voted Leave by substantial amounts were New Addington and Fieldway, neighbouring wards with large council estates. Beyond the areas with the strongest backing for Leave and Remain, examining the detailed breakdown of votes in various places gives greater insight into the pattern of support for the two sides - as can be seen from the following examples.In several places (for example, Birmingham, Bristol, Nottingham, Portsmouth) there was a strong contrast between the Leave-voting populations of large, rundown, predominantly white, housing estates in the urban periphery, versus Remain-voting populations in inner city areas with large numbers of ethnic minorities and sometimes students.Birmingham had several wards with large Remain votes, although the city as a whole narrowly voted Leave.  These pro-Remain wards tended to be the more highly educated, better off localities, or minority ethnic areas which strongly backed Remain despite low levels of educational qualifications. I have written about this before. In Blackburn with Darwen, Bastwell ward had the highest Remain vote at 65%, compared to only 44% in the area as a whole. This ward has an ethnic minority proportion of over 90%. Other Blackburn wards which voted Remain were also ones with high minority populations.Bradford voted to Leave (54%), but the area included some starkly contrasting places which went over 60% Remain: the prosperous, genteel, spa town of Ilkley, and strongly ethnic minority wards in the city, such as Manningham and Toller.Bristol voted strongly Remain on the whole (62%), but there were some striking exceptions, particularly the large, deprived, mainly white estates to the south of the city. Hartcliffe and Withywood backed Leave at 67%. Similar neighbouring wards (Hengrove and Whitchurch Park, Filwood, Bishopsworth and Stockwood) also voted Leave, as did the more industrial area of Avonmouth and Lawrence Weston to the north west of the city.As a county Cornwall voted to Leave. But one of its six parliamentary constituencies, Truro and Falmouth, voted 53% to Remain, possibly linked to a significant student population.In Lincoln, which voted 57% to Leave, Carholme ward stands out as very different - it voted 63% to Remain. This ward includes Lincoln University, and 43% of the residents are students Middlesbrough voted 65% to Leave. As already noted, it had several wards with extremely high leave votes of over 75%. But one ward, Linthorpe, voted very narrowly to Remain - a comparatively well-to-do inner suburb which includes an art college; and another ward, Central, which contains Teesside University, nearly did. Mole Valley in Surrey exhibited a dramatic contrast between two neighbouring districts with very different demographics and housing. The highest Remain vote was in the very prosperous location of Dorking South, which voted 63% Remain, but the neighbouring ward of Holmwoods, dominated by large estates on the edge of the town of Dorking, voted 57% Leave, the area's highest Leave vote. Nottingham voted narrowly to Leave, but the inner city ward of Radford and Park voted 68% Remain. This has both a comparatively high proportion of ethnic minorities and considerable numbers of students from two nearby universities. There was a lot of variation within the area. Bulwell - a market town to the north of the city with many social problems - voted 69% Leave  There was also a high Leave vote in the housing estate locations of the Clifton wards in the south of Nottingham.Oldham voted to Leave at 61%, but Werneth, the city ward with the highest ethnic minority population, voted Remain (57%). Other wards with high minority populations also voted Remain.In Oxford the cluster of polling districts which included Blackbird Leys and other deprived estates on the southern edge of the city voted to Leave at 51%. In contrast the central areas containing colleges, university buildings and student accommodation voted to Remain at over 80%.Plymouth voted 60% Leave, but Drake ward which includes the university had the city's highest Remain vote at 56%. Portsmouth was another place with wide variation. Paulsgrove ward, with its large estate on the edge of the city, had the highest Leave vote at 70%, whereas at the other end of the spectrum Central Southsea, an inner city ward and student area, voted 57% Remain.Rochdale voted 60% Leave. The place which bucked this trend by voting 59% Remain, Milkstone and Deeplish, was the most predominantly ethnic minority ward. Central Rochdale had the second highest Remain vote and is the other ward that is mainly not white. Walsall voted strongly Leave (68%). The only ward which voted Remain, Paddock, is both a comparatively prosperous and multi-ethnic locality.A few councils released their data at remarkably localised levels, down even to individual polling districts (ie ballot boxes) in the case of Blackburn with Darwen and Bracknell Forest, or clusters of two/three/four districts, in the case of Amber Valley, Brentwood, Sevenoaks, Shetland, South Oxfordshire, and Tewkesbury.This provides very local and specific data, in some cases just for neighbourhoods of hundreds of voters.At its most detailed this reveals that the 110 people who cast their votes in the ballot box at St. Alban's Primary School in central Blackburn split 56-52 in favour of Remain, with two spoilt papers.It also discloses stark contrasts in some neighbouring locations. The 953 people who voted at Little Harwood community centre in north Blackburn had a Leave vote of only 31%, while the 336 electors who voted in the neighbouring ballot box at Roe Lee Park primary school produced a Leave percentage over twice as high, at 64%.The very detailed data we obtained also provides some rare evidence on the views of postal compared to non-postal voters. Campaign strategists have often deliberated on whether the two groups vote differently and should be given separate targeted messages.Most places mixed boxes of postal and non-postal votes for counting, so generally it's not possible to draw comparative conclusions. However there were a few exceptions which recorded them separately, or included a very small number of non-postal votes with the postals.These figures indicate that postal voters were narrowly less likely to back Leave than voters in polling stations. Data covering five counting areas with about 260,000 votes shows that in these places the roughly one in five electors who voted by post backed Leave at 55.4%, one percentage point lower than the local non-postal support for Leave of 56.4%.The counting areas involved are Amber Valley, East Cambridgeshire, Gwynedd, Hyndburn and North Warwickshire.Since the referendum the BBC has been trying to get the most detailed, localised voting data we could from each of the counting areas.  This was a major data collection exercise carried out by my colleague George Greenwood. We managed to obtain voting figures broken down into smaller geographical units for 178 of the 399 referendum counting areas (380 councils in England, Wales and Scotland, with a separate tally in Gibraltar, while in Northern Ireland results were issued for the 18 constituencies). This varied between data for individual local government wards, wards grouped into clusters, and constituency level data. In a few cases the results supplied were even more localised than ward level. Overall the extra data covers a wide range of different areas and kinds of councils across the UK. Electoral returning officers are not covered by the Freedom of Information Act, so releasing the information was up to the discretion of councils. While some were very willing, in other cases it required a lot of persistence and persuasion. Some councils could not supply any detailed data because they mixed all ballot boxes prior to counting; some did possess more local figures but simply refused to disclose them to us. Others did provide data, but the combinations in which ballot boxes were mixed before counting were too complex to fit ward boundaries neatly.A few places such as Birmingham released their ward by ward data following the referendum on their own initiative, but in most cases the information had to be obtained by us requesting it directly, and sometimes repeatedly, from the authority."

The government has now specified what would count as exceptional circumstances. It is not clear whether the new rules will be more or less strict than just letting councils decide what counted as exceptional circumstances. The government has described the housing market as broken, promised more affordable homes and said it would help people to buy and rent.A big question in discussions of increasing the supply of homes is whether planning regulations will be changed to make it easier to build on green belt land.Green belts were introduced after World War Two to stop cities from sprawling and countryside being spoilt. About 13% of England is now covered.This covers scenic sites open to the public, such as the Chiltern Hills and North Downs, but it also covers a lot of land that has limited public access and may not be particularly beautiful.In the House of Commons, Communities Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""In 2015, we promised the British people that the green belt was safe in our hands and that is still the case.""So what has changed?There has been little variation in the amount of green belt land since 1997, although data is not available for every year.The Housing White Paper says the current planning regulations allow building on the green belt only ""in exceptional circumstances"" but that there is no detail given of what would amount to exceptional circumstances.The government has now specified that before allowing development on green belt land, councils would need to rule out options including: The White Paper also says that councils allowing the boundaries of green belt land to be changed would have to make up for it by improving other bits of green belt. It also asks for suggestions of other things councils should take into account before doing so. Read more from Reality Check"
2017-02-11,Budget lookahead,https://web.archive.org//web/20170212031033/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-38891441,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkPhilip Hammond knows all about the government's attempts to ""get the public finances in order"" following the financial crisis of 2008.He was the man, as shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, credited by many for the tough detail of the austerity plan laid before voters in the run up to the 2010 election.George Osborne was the architect, Mr Hammond the foreman, ensuring there was a plan that might actually have a chance of working, public sector cut by public sector cut.Now Mr Hammond is the man in charge of the public finances - his dream government job and, a relatively rare occurrence for the resident of Number 11, said authoritatively to be the high water mark of his ambitions.Whatever his relations with the Prime Minister, and they are better than often reported, the fact that he doesn't want to move his sofas next door is a useful salve to any scratchiness between Downing Street's most important neighbours.Today sees the publication of the Institute for Fiscal Studies' (IFS) annual Green Budget, its analysis of Mr Hammond's room for manoeuvre as he prepares for the real Budget, on 8 March.There is one clear message.If you thought the era of cuts is over, think again.Day-to-day spending, officially known rather more prosaically as the Resource Departmental Expenditure Limit (which excludes investment spending), is set to fall by 4% over the next three years.The IFS says that a ""particularly sharp cut"" has been loaded onto the last year of the parliament, 2019-20, never a particularly comfortable time for a government to be squeezing the public sector pips even more aggressively.Alongside that, the IFS says the overall tax burden is set to rise as a proportion of national income to the highest level since 1986.That is not a function of actual tax rises - taxes for many millions of people have fallen as income tax thresholds have risen - but a function of a relatively high tax take throughout an era of pretty stagnant growth.Will Mr Hammond change course on 8 March, and further loosen the government's austerity strictures as he did in the Autumn Statement last year - pushing the deficit reduction target into the conveniently indistinct long grass of ""during the next parliament""?The government has, after all, promised an economy that works for all.I am told not - and that Mr Hammond is approaching his first Budget as a ""steady-as-she-goes affair"" with no major yanks on the national rudder, particularly given the economy's robust performance since the Brexit referendum.It has been pointed out to me that, just ahead of the triggering of Article 50 - the official mechanism for leaving the European Union - the last thing Britain needs is a reset of fiscal policy.In 2010, the Conservatives were elected as the party that would bring public income and public expenditure into balance.Mr Hammond still cleaves to that view. ""He is a Conservative,"" as one official close to him says.George Osborne's economic approach is alive and well. Yes, there are criticisms by some economists that there is no need to run a country like a household budget where pennies in and pennies out matter - governments are able to borrow at very cheap rates on the international markets and put that money to economically valuable use.Yes, there are criticisms that debt costs as a percentage of national income are low by historic standards and so the room for manoeuvre is rather greater than the national debt headline figures suggest.But those close to Mr Hammond argue that, OK, borrowing may be cheap now but servicing Britain's £1.7 trillion debt is still expensive, costing around £34bn a year, or 4.6% of all government spending.Cut out the deficit and start dealing with the debt and those costs can be brought down.Certainly, since the referendum, the cost of government debt has increased as rising inflation risk pushes up yields - the interest rate on government bonds issued to investors.Mr Hammond is briefing the Cabinet for the first time this week on the broad parameters of next month's Budget.He will talk about Britain's historic productivity problem and how to solve it, he will talk about skills, he will talk about research and development support and he will talk about infrastructure spending.Supporting the private economy is his priority, not reversing public sector cuts.Mr Hammond will also say that the new world of work - the gig economy - is affecting the way the Treasury has to approach complicated issues such as tax receipts as the number of self-employed - who tend to pay a lower proportion of their income to the state - grows.A lot of it will be rhetoric at this stage.For Mr Hammond wants to keep his powder dry.Dry for the bigger fiscal event of the year, the autumn Budget (as we should now call it) in November or December.As he said last year, he only wants one major tax and spend ""moment"" a year.And it's not going to be next month.

The veteran Gaullist already has form.When he was Commissioner for the Internal Market and Financial Services, Mr Barnier was dubbed ""the most dangerous man in Europe"" after taking on the banking sector and championing a cap on bankers' bonuses. But while he alarmed some in the City, and will probably do so again, he also won grudging respect as a tough but even-handed negotiator.He will need all those skills and more in his new role - chief Brexit negotiator at the European Commission. And having moved seamlessly between big jobs in Paris and Brussels - French foreign minister, Commissioner, MEP - he looks well prepared. ""Don't ask me to tell you what will be at the end of the road, we haven't begun to walk yet,"" he told a conference in Brussels last month. Mr Barnier will stick closely to the official EU position of ""no negotiation without notification"" - waiting for the UK to trigger Article 50 to start the formal process of withdrawal. But he's clearly eager to get going.""I am waiting to begin,"" he said. ""I will be ready tomorrow to negotiate, frankly speaking.""And he will bring with him an instinctive pro-European agenda, and a deep knowledge of the workings of the single market.His deputy as chief Brexit negotiator is a German trade expert, Sabine Weyand, adding to the impression that Mr Barnier will lead a team that means business.One of the biggest challenges he (and his boss Jean-Claude Juncker) faces, is to ensure that representatives of the big member states don't sideline him in the Brexit divorce negotiations.But Mr Barnier's long career in French politics means he could well have the ear of the Elysee Palace, especially if - as looks likely - a centre-right candidate wins the French presidency next year. The stakes are so high that there are bound to be some clashes.Mr Barnier has sparred with the UK's Minister for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, before, when the men both served as Europe ministers in the 1990s. It is another reminder that Michel Barnier is a politician first and foremost, rather than a bureaucrat. There have certainly been criticisms - a dash of vanity, a lack of attention to detail. His career has had plenty of downs as well as ups.But he will defend his European vision to the end, and the British government would do well not to underestimate him.At the height of the eurozone crisis, Mr Barnier always refused (politely) to do broadcast interviews in English.""One wrong word,"" he told me once with a smile, ""and we could move markets.""The next few years will be equally challenging."

But people who had supported ""Better Together"" during the Scottish referendum vote also spoke about the possibility of a break-away from the UK as a result of the vote over EU membership.  Perhaps the most significant was Scottish author JK Rowling who tweeted: ""Scotland will seek independence now. Cameron's legacy will be breaking up two unions. Neither needed to happen.""Many took to Twitter to express new or strengthened pro-independence feelings in the wake of the latest vote (Just as a reminder: a ""Yes"" vote in Scotland's 2014 referendum was for independence, while the winning ""No"" campaign backed staying in the UK).One old tweet from 2014's independence referendum gained new life on Friday.

The key points of her speech were:The current rate of re-offending within a year of conviction is 25.3%.Speaking to the Centre for Social Justice, Ms Truss said: ""Reductions by cap or quota, or by sweeping sentencing cuts are not a magic bullet, they are a dangerous attempt at a quick fix.""The most recent figures put the population of inmates in England and Wales at 85,490 in 2016 - up from 50,962 on average in 1995.Put prisoner safety first, charities sayWhat is going wrong with the prison system?Ms Truss said more sex offenders were being sent to prison as sentence lengths ""better reflect the severity"" of crimes like domestic violence, rape and child abuse.She rejected calls by Labour officials to reduce the number of prisoners in England and Wales by half, warning that such a move would be ""reckless"" and ""endanger the public"".Ms Truss said courts needed to be given the right tools to intervene before prison was an option.""There can never be an excuse for committing crime but too often people end up in prison because our interventions to tackle problems like drug addiction or mental health issues don't work as well as they should,"" she added.""Community sentences are most effective when they tackle the problems that contribute to the offender's crime."" The justice secretary said the Prison and Courts Bill - due to be published this month - will ""enshrine in law that reforming offenders is a key purpose of prison and that the Secretary of State has a responsibility for delivering it"".""This will usher in the biggest reform of our prisons in a generation. It will transform our prisons from offender warehouses to disciplined and purposeful centres of reform,"" she added.After her speech, Ms Truss said she would be meeting with the family of Dean Saunders, who died in Chelmsford Prison after he was found electrocuted in his cell.Andrew Neilson, spokesman for the Howard League for Penal Reform, said the justice secretary needed to act to get prison numbers down quickly.""She wants to reduce prison numbers in a long-term way through tackling reoffending but she won't look at sentencing reform to actually try and get numbers down quickly,"" he told the BBC.""And I'm afraid that without that sentencing reform we are going to continue to have ministers making similar speeches bemoaning the violence and the deaths in prisons because we will not get a solution without doing something about prison numbers."""
2017-02-12,UK warned over 'divide and rule' Brexit,https://web.archive.org//web/20170213180622/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38959995,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe UK should not try to play different EU states off against each other or pursue ""special discussions"" in key areas, a top EU official has warned.European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker said the UK may want to be more ""obliging"" to certain countries to secure future commercial advantages.The EU is keen to maintain a united front and conduct central negotiations.Meanwhile, a leading candidate to be France's next President says he will take a ""pretty tough"" line on Brexit.Emmanuel Macron, who opinion polls suggest could win May's election, told Channel 4 News the UK should not be punished for voting to leave the EU but the EU's interests had to be paramount into the upcoming negotiations.""We have to preserve the rest of the European Union and not to convey the message that you can decide to leave without any consequence,"" he said. Official discussions on the terms of the UK's exit and its future relationship with the EU are expected to begin in the Spring once the UK has triggered Article 50 - notifying the union of its intention to leave.Prime Minister Theresa May has made clear that the UK will leave the EU's single market and wants bespoke commercial and customs agreements based on tariff-free and ""frictionless"" cross-border trade.  She has also made clear that she is prepared to leave the EU without a formal deal rather sign up to a bad one.The final agreement on the UK's exit will need the approval of 20 out of the EU's 27 other member states as well as the support of the European Parliament. However, a future trade deal could need the backing of all EU states.There have been suggestions the UK could potentially exploit divisions within the EU over how hard a bargain they are willing to drive.Several EU leaders have insisted the UK cannot expect a better deal outside the EU than it has now and their priority is to protect the interests of the remaining 27 members. Others have advised against ""punishing"" the UK. Speaking after holding talks with Austrian Chancellor Christian Kern, Mr Juncker said there would be no parallel negotiations and the UK would not be allowed to conduct bilateral discussions in key areas such as finance, telecommunications or chemicals.""A situation could arise whereby the UK might attempt to or wish to be obliging to certain member states in certain economic zones and certain sectors whereby those countries might wish to provide certain advantages to the UK,"" he said.""It is in our interests therefore that we don't have any special discussions... with certain individual countries.""Mr Kern said that Europe would not ""capitulate"" to the UK by granting it a better status than it would enjoy if it was still an EU member.""If you want to be a member of a club you have better conditions, obviously, than if you want to be outside the club,"" he said.The EU's negotiating team will be headed up by former commissioner Michel Barnier.Speaking during a visit to Finland his UK counterpart, Brexit Secretary David Davis, said he wanted an outcome which was good for the EU as well as the UK.""We're not talking about a break-up, we're talking about a new relationship, that's what we want to see,"" he said. The UK's former ambassador to the EU Sir Ivan Rogers has said the negotiations - which are scheduled to be completed in two years - will be ""humungous"" in scope.Preparatory work has been taking place in more than 50 different sectors, spanning manufacturing and services as well as key industries such as farming and fishing."

Talking to Reading students, Mr Bercow said: ""Personally, I voted to remain. I thought it was better to stay in the European Union than not.""He said this was ""partly for economic reasons - being part of a big trade bloc - and partly because I think we're in a world of power blocs.""I think for all the weaknesses and deficiencies of the European Union, it's better to be part of that big power bloc in the world than thinking you can act as effectively on your own.""He also said immigration was a good thing and expressed concern Labour had not done more to strike a ""very clear, resonant Remain note"".When he was elected Speaker in 2009, Mr Bercow said he would serve for no more than nine years.Responding to the row over his Brexit comments, his spokeswoman said he had voted in  June's referendum ""along with millions of others"".""The record shows that he has rigorously facilitated the raising of concerns of those on both sides of this argument, as he does on every other issue,"" she said.""The Speaker's impartiality is required on matters of debate before the House, and he has been scrupulous in ensuring that both sides of the argument are always heard.""Asked if the prime minister thought Mr Bercow was doing a good job, her spokesman said: ""The Speaker is a matter for MPs, he's the elected chairman of the House of Commons, he's not a member of the government, he's not appointed by the government.""He represents all the MPs in the House of Commons. It's up to them to decide whether they feel he's doing a good job or not."""
2017-02-12,MPs reject grammars as 'distraction',https://web.archive.org//web/20170213180622/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-38956439,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe government has failed to make a convincing case for opening a new wave of grammar schools in England, say MPs.The education select committee has cast doubt on claims that they can help social mobility.There is also scepticism about whether an entrance test for grammars can be made ""tutor proof"".Neil Carmichael, the committee's chair, says the focus on expanding grammars has become an ""unnecessary distraction"" from improving the school system.The Department for Education has argued that removing the ban on opening new grammars will be a way of making ""more good school places available, to more parents, in more parts of the country"".The cross-party committee of MPs, responding to the evidence gathered about plans to increase selective education, said ministers still needed to demonstrate how this would improve social mobility and close the gap between rich and poor pupils.MPs said there had been no convincing evidence that a test could be devised which would not favour those who could afford private coaching.As such they argued that such tests should not be the only criteria for entry.The MPs also raised concerns about how an expansion of grammars would affect other non-selective schools, in terms of funding and the supply of teachers.The committee called on the government to carry out an assessment of the potential impact on the wider school system.Head teachers wrote to MPs last week to express their ""incredulity"" that grammar schools were being offered extra funds to expand places, while they were facing job cuts because of deepening pressures on their budgets.The cross-party committee also highlighted the vagueness of the plans so far - with no clear outline of how many grammar schools would be created or how local demand for such grammars would be measured.There were also questions about whether this push for academic selection should be a priority when there had been so many concerns about vocational skills shortages.""The focus on opening new grammar schools is, in my view, an unnecessary distraction from the need to ensure all our young people are equipped with the skills to compete in the modern workplace,"" said Mr Carmichael.Since the prime minister last year announced the ambition to create new grammars, there have been few details of how this might be put into practice.But last week the Grammar School Heads' Association published details of a private meeting with education ministers, where they discussed options for expanding selection.This suggested that new grammar schools could open from 2020 - but in the meantime there would be £150m funding to expand existing grammars or to introduce grammar streams through academy trusts.There was also a suggestion that these new grammars would be much more selective than traditional grammars, with places for the top 10% of the ability range.Another idea was that there would be a single national entry test for grammars, rather than a range of local tests, with the aim of designing an exam that would be more resistant to coaching by private tutors.A Department for Education spokeswoman said that grammar schools have a ""track record of closing the attainment gap to almost zero between children on free school meals and their better off classmates"".The spokeswoman said that ""99% of grammar schools are rated good or outstanding; and even when you take higher ability intakes into account pupils still perform better in selective schools than in non-selective schools"". Labour's shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, said: ""When even the Conservative-dominated education select committee calls Theresa May's new grammar schools an 'unnecessary distraction', it's time that ministers finally sat up and took notice.""There is a crisis in teacher recruitment, schools budgets are being cut for the first time in decades and hundreds of thousands of pupils are in super-sized classes. The Tories should be keeping their pledge to protect school funding rather than pressing ahead with this policy,"" she said.John Pugh, the Liberal Democrats' education spokesman, said: ""Instead of ploughing ahead with these divisive plans, Theresa May should address the £3bn funding black hole facing our schools over the next five years.""Sir Peter Lampl, founder of the Sutton Trust, backed the calls for the government to show evidence that new grammars could close the attainment gap - when less than 3% of grammar school entrants are eligible for free school meals.""Until existing grammar schools demonstrate they can be vehicles for social mobility, the number of grammar schools should not be increased,"" said Sir Peter."
2017-02-12,Pensioners 'now better off than workers',https://web.archive.org//web/20170213180622/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-38948369,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkTypical pensioner incomes after housing costs now outstrip those of working-age people, a new report suggests.The Resolution Foundation also says pensioners are more likely than their predecessors to be working, own a home and have generous private pensions.The think tank says growth in pensioner incomes has been coupled with weak income growth for working-age people.Pensioner households are now £20 a week better off than working age households, but were £70 a week worse off in 2001.Reality Check: Are pensioners better off than workers?Pensions, parents and children: Am I better off?However, the report, called As Time Goes By, adds: ""This strong growth is not the result of a boom time for all pensioners, with most finding that their personal situation changes little from year to year. ""It says while typical incomes across the pensioner population have grown by more than 30% since 2001, the typical income of someone who turned 65 in that year was only 7% higher by 2014.Adam Corlett, economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: ""The main driver of pensioner income growth has been the arrival of successive new waves of pensioners, who are more likely to work, own their home and have generous private pension wealth than any previous generation.""Of course, not all pensioners can draw on these income sources, which is why the state pension will always be the main income for many pensioners. ""We can't assume either that young people today will be able to draw upon the kind of wealth that recent pensioners have accumulated, given the recent fall in home ownership and decline in generous defined benefit schemes.""The report identifies four key drivers of growth in typical pensioner incomes since the 2000s.These are: the possession of occupational pensions, a growth in the numbers in employment, increased state benefits, and a move towards home ownership from renting. But the Resolution Foundation warns that future generations of pensioners cannot assume that they will benefit from further gains from these income sources.Other findings include:Lord David Willetts - an executive chair of the Resolution Foundation and former Conservative minister - said that the ""triple-lock"" pension policy of successive governments should be reviewed. The triple-lock guarantees pensions rise by the same as average earnings, the consumer price index, or 2.5%, whichever is the highest.""Of course there has to be some kind of framework for increasing the state pension,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme. ""But the [triple-lock] is a very powerful ratchet pushing up pensions at a time when incomes of the less affluent half of working households are barely rising at all."" He added: ""I actually think pensioners worry about their kids and grandchildren. They don't want to live in a society where all the big increases in incomes are accruing to pensioners and other groups are being left behind.""  He said the government needed to look at ways of improving younger people's ""pension rights"" and chances of owning their own homes.""These are all things that have enabled today's pensioners to be so prosperous,"" he said."
2017-02-12,Undercover filming reveals prison chaos,https://web.archive.org//web/20170213180622/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-38931580,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkChaos in one of the biggest prisons in the country has been revealed in secret filming for the BBC.An undercover reporter spent two months at HMP Northumberland, which houses up to 1,348 male inmates, for Panorama. He discovered widespread drug use, a lack of control, door alarms that did not go off in one block and a hole in an internal security fence. The Ministry of Justice said it would investigate the ""extremely serious allegations"" at the Acklington jail.Prison officers also found balaclavas, blackout clothing and wire-cutting tools at the category C jail.It is believed inmates had been sneaking out to collect drugs or other contraband thrown over the perimeter fence. These discoveries were made in a block where inmates preparing to transfer to open prisons were not locked in their cells at night. In one of the most disturbing episodes of the undercover investigation, footage shows a prison officer having convulsions on the floor after accidentally inhaling spice, a cheap and stronger synthetic alternative to cannabis, which is rife in the jail.What is going wrong with the prison system?Put prisoner safety first, charities sayPrison suicides rise to record levelThe undercover reporter, who was working as a custody officer, was told by some staff they did not feel able to confront prisoners because they were worried back-up support would take too long to arrive. During the secret filming, the reporter also recorded scenes including: The Panorama investigation comes days after the Ministry of Justice announced the replacement of the National Offender Management Service with a new prison and probation service aimed at cutting crime and reforming offenders. HMP Northumberland is run by Sodexo Justice Services. It was privatised in 2014, when the government was aiming to cut £500m from the prisons budget.  To win the contract, Sodexo pledged to save the taxpayer £130m over 15 years. Two hundred jobs, including 96 prison officer posts, were cut.At the time of the deal, the Prison Officers Association warned it could result in ""escapes and riots"". Read Prison Undercover: Reporter Joe Fenton's story:It didn't take too long to realise the inmates were, in effect, running this prisonHMP Northumberland is a training prison that is meant to offer a range of education and training programmes to prepare inmates for release. The Panorama reporter witnessed some inmates colouring in pictures of the children's cartoon character Peppa Pig in an ""employability skills"" class provided by an outside contractor, Novus.It told Panorama it had investigated these concerns and sent a report to the government.The president of the Prison Governors Association, Andrea Albutt, told the BBC previous staff cuts were behind the loss of control. She said: ""The situation is that there are so few prison officers at the moment - that their confidence has been affected and we have a more violent prison population.""Good quality staff-prisoner relationships, which yielded intelligence, had been hit by the lack of staff, she said.The Ministry of Justice told the BBC: ""The justice secretary has been clear that levels of violence and self harm in our prisons are too high, which is why we are investing an extra £100m annually to boost the front line by 2,500 officers.""These are longstanding issues which will not be resolved in weeks or months but we are determined to make our prisons places of safety and reform.""A spokesman for Sodexo said: ""We are proud of those staff at HMP Northumberland who do a professional job in such difficult circumstances. ""Security and the safety of our prisoners and staff are our top priority, which is why we have made significant investments in these two areas over and above the contract requirements.""As part of the investigation, Panorama analysed what prisoners had been saying about safety in prisons across England and Wales. Panorama took HM Inspectorate of Prisons data on prisoners' perceptions and analysed it to reveal how fears have changed over the last decade. The calculations are a snapshot of what inmates said was happening at the time of the inspection. Not every jail is inspected every year and conditions can change rapidly if a new regime or resources are introduced.Sir Martin Narey, former head of the Prison Service and now a non-executive member of the Ministry of Justice's board, said: ""The plain truth is that there are too few prison officers.""If that reduction in number leads to a lack of confidence, then the great danger is some officers have retreated from interaction with prisoners to the ends of wings.""That's very dangerous for the sort of prison service that we want.""Sir Martin believes that Justice Secretary Elizabeth Truss's pledge to recruit more officers would make a difference. ""We need to concentrate on recovering their confidence,"" he said.""The disorder we've seen more recently reflects prisoner anger about reductions in regime.""""If you take people and lock them up and don't use that period to try to do something, then we're just losing a golden opportunity.""This was echoed by the Conservative MP and former prisons minister Crispin Blunt,  who said: ""We have got to get to a place where prison is used as a place to turn people around.""

Inflation is also predicted to rise this year in the eurozone, reaching an annual rate of 1.%, up from just 0.2% in 2016.The view of the Commission on the UK was shared recently by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR).Earlier this month it also predicted an economic slowdown in the UK, with the country growing by 1.7% this year and 1.9% in 2018."

The Association for Licensed Multiple Retailers (ALMR) has written to Philip Hammond asking for more transitional relief for the sector. Business rates in England and Wales are being updated to take into account changes in property values. However, the government says a cap on how much bills can rise will cushion the impact for firms facing increases. The letter written by the ALMR on behalf of its members says that ""on average, the pub sector will see a 15% increase and restaurants a 23% increase across the country"".""This will add a further £300m to £500m in additional cost in the hospitality sector,"" it says.The ALMR says the impact of the extra costs could threaten the positive contribution the sector is making to overall economic growth in the UK. The ALMR represents leading brands, including Pizza Express, Wagamama and Yo Sushi, as well as smaller businesses operating from only one or two premises. ""We would urge you to consider reviewing the transitional relief provisions and the introduction of sector specific hospitality retail relief,"" the letter says. Rates are calculated by multiplying the rateable value of a property by a multiplier set by the government. But as property values change over time, rateable values need to be reassessed periodically - usually every five years.However this update to property values is two years behind schedule, making it a harder pill to swallow in areas where the price of real estate has been rising. A statement from the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) said that most businesses will not face sharp rises in costs.""Following the revaluation, three-quarters of properties will see no change or even a fall in their bills, and the small minority of businesses that face an increase will benefit from our £3.6bn transitional relief scheme,"" it said.However, property experts have predicted that some businesses, especially in thriving commercial centres and the south-east of England could see very dramatic changes to their rates bills, by as much as several hundred percent.Many pubs and restaurants occupy prime real estate in town and city centres. The DCLG added that many pubs had seen turnover increase significantly since the last rates valuation in 2010 as a result of the growth in casual dining. That increase in revenue would affect the rateable value of the property, it said.However the government's planned cap on annual increases means that bills will rise gradually over five years rather than all in one go, with greater protection provided for smaller businesses.The DCLG said that while some businesses will see their rates bill rise, others will see bills remain the same or even fall.Overall the rates upgrade is designed to be revenue neutral."

Mr Watson said the party had ""got the leadership settled for this Parliament"".   The most recent ICM opinion poll put Labour on 27%, 15 points behind the Conservatives. And a YouGov poll suggested that 62% of voters were unfavourable towards Mr Corbyn, compared with 22% who were favourable. The Sunday Times is reporting that Labour is involved in ""succession planning"", and research carried out on its behalf suggests Mr Corbyn is the ""most unpopular"" choice.Labour's elections co-ordinator, Ian Lavery told the BBC: ""There's plenty of leaders to pick from if and when Jeremy decides, of his own volition, that it's not for him at the election. That isn't the case at this point in time.""Asked if Labour was looking at potential replacements for Mr Corbyn in carrying out its research, Mr Lavery said: ""I'm absolutely sure that that hasn't been the case and isn't the case. Speaking on BBC Radio 5 live's Pienaar's Politics, he added: ""I think that's pure political poppycock. To suggest that the Labour party have been like polling with these groupings to identify popularity between potential candidates for the leadership is nonsense.""And Mr Watson told the Andrew Marr Show: ""I only saw this story last night. People tell me that isn't the case, it wasn't road-testing leadership candidates. ""There was a range of shadow cabinet members that were so-called road-tested, this is what we do in our normal run of political consultations.""I'm just slightly relieved they weren't road testing me on the document that was leaked to the newspaper."" The churn in Corbyn's shadow cabinetMr Corbyn saw off a challenge from Owen Smith last year, winning 61.8% of the vote - a higher share than in the first contest.Mr Watson said: ""This is not the time for a leadership election. He got a second mandate from our members last year. He is now the established leader of the Labour Party.""It is his duty to lead the official Opposition through a period of unprecedented economic uncertainty and he will be tested. He has to explain those and he has to improve on them and he's well aware of that.""Last week, Mr Corbyn imposed a three-line whip - the strongest possible sanction - on his MPs to support the government's Brexit bill, arguing that this reflected the will of the people, as expressed in last year's EU referendum.Shadow business secretary Clive Lewis resigned from the front bench, saying that to back the bill would go against his conscience. Altogether, 52 Labour MPs voted against Mr Corbyn's orders.Mr Watson called the timing of Mr Lewis's resignation not ""particularly helpful"", but welcomed his denial of rumours he was mounting a bid to topple Mr Corbyn.He said: ""We've had a tough 18 months. We had a damaging second leadership election, so we've got an uphill struggle ahead. ""The polls aren't great for us, but I'm determined that we've got the leadership settled for this Parliament, that we can focus on developing a very positive, clear message to the British people in a general election.""He added: ""We need to make sure we address the concerns of the British people in a manifesto and that we communicate our message far more clearly than we have been doing. But there's nothing to say that Labour can't win a general election.""Mr Watson said Labour had to convince voters the party wanted ""this country to be great again, that if you live and work hard in this country you can eventually own your own home or rent a home at an affordable price, have a job that is satisfying and then have a dignified retirement.""Political parties that don't address those issues are political parties that don't have a future.""He described Labour as ""a patriotic party"", saying: ""We're very proud of our country and very proud of singing the national anthem.""ICM interviewed 1,984 adults from 3 to 5 February. For its poll, YouGov interviewed 1,670 adults on 2 and 3 February."

The paper claimed that, afterwards, the Brexit secretary exchanged texts with a Conservative colleague who said that he could not believe Mr Davis tried to give Ms Abbott a hug.In reply, Mr David reportedly said he hadn't, but had ""whispered in her ear"" to say ""Thanks for your vote"".He then allegedly added: ""I am not blind.""Labour MP Chuka Umunna told Sky's Sophy Ridge: ""I think it's sexist, I think it's misogynistic...""This type of behaviour has absolutely no place in the Conservative Party or British politics full stop.""And Lady Chakrabarti told ITV's Peston on Sunday: ""Diane Abbott and David Davis were once on the same side on some really important civil liberties issues in this country and he should show her more respect.""She added: ""David Davis was very silly. He was sexist and he was patronising and let's just say, Diane is not someone who would have her hand patted by Donald Trump or David Davis or anybody else.""A spokesman for the Brexit secretary said: ""This was a self-evidently jocular and private exchange with a friend. ""The secretary of state is very sorry for any offence caused to Miss Abbott, someone he has known and respected for many years.""Mr Davis's Conservative colleague, House of Commons leader David Lidington, told the same programme: ""It does sound to me like the sort of thing that is said in the rugby club bar rather than the House of Commons.""David Davis's spokesperson has apologised to Diane Abbott on behalf of David Davis, so plainly he did send the texts.

But many do not get access to mental health support.The report claims that staff shortages, a ""toxic"" working environment and a failure to recognise the impact of prison on both prisoners and staff, all contribute to an ""unsafe environment"".It recommends three steps to help prisons shift away from a ""primarily punitive approach"" to a culture centred on wellbeing, recovery and rehabilitation:Sarah Hughes, chief executive of the Centre for Mental Health, said: ""We need to bring about a culture change in prisons that puts safety top of the agenda, that understands the traumas both prisoners and staff too often live with, and that means people get the right help when they need it."" Last month, the Ministry of Justice said there were 119 self-inflicted deaths in prisons in England and Wales in 2016 - 29 more than the previous year and the highest number since records began in 1978.Frances Crook, chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said it was ""time for action"".She added: ""No-one should be so desperate while in the care of the state that they take their own life. ""Staff who work in prisons should never feel so under pressure that they cannot stop and listen.""A government spokeswoman said: ""Increased support is now available to those at risk of self-harm or suicide, especially in the first 24 hours, and we have invested in mental health awareness training for staff.""An internal inquiry is also under way looking at all deaths in custody in the last year, to further our understanding of why these events happen.""

2017-02-12,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20170213180622/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThis article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide to the UK's vote to leave the European Union. It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 52% to 48%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who resigned on the day after losing the referendum. Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she says she will respect the will of the people. She has said ""Brexit means Brexit"" but there is still a lot of debate about what that will mean in practice especially on the two key issues of how British firms do business in the European Union and what curbs are brought in on the rights of European Union nationals to live and work in the UK. She set out more details of her negotiating hopes in her key speech on Brexit.The UK economy appears to have weathered the initial shock of the Brexit vote, although the value of the pound remains near a 30-year low, but opinion is sharply divided over the long-term effects of leaving the EU. Some major firms such as Easyjet and John Lewis have pointed out that the slump in sterling has increased their costs. Britain also lost its top AAA credit rating, meaning the cost of government borrowing will be higher. But share prices have recovered from a dramatic slump in value, with both the FTSE 100 and the broader FTSE 250 index, which includes more British-based businesses, trading higher than before the referendum. The Bank of England cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - a record low and the first cut since 2009 - after the vote and there has not been the economic slump or recession that some had predicted. The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it has to invoke an agreement called Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May has said she intends to trigger this process by the end of March 2017, meaning the UK will be expected to have left by the summer of 2019, depending on the precise timetable agreed during the negotiations. The government will also enact a Great Repeal Bill which will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. It is expected to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove.After a court battle, the UK's Supreme Court ruled in January that Parliament must be consulted before Article 50 is invoked. This is why a two line Brexit bill is currently making its way through Parliament. MPs have approved it after Labour MPs were told to support it. It is now heading to the House of Lords to be debated and voted on.Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These men - dubbed the Three Brexiteers - will play a central role in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although it will be Mrs May, as prime minister, who will have the final say. David Cameron's government did not do any emergency planning for Brexit ahead of the referendum and Mrs May has rejected calls to say what her negotiating goals are.Once Article 50 has been triggered, the UK will have two years to negotiate its withdrawal. But no one really knows how the Brexit process will work - Article 50 was only created in late 2009 and it has never been used. Former Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, now Chancellor, wanted Britain to remain in the EU, and he has suggested it could take up to six years for the UK to complete exit negotiations. The terms of Britain's exit will have to be agreed by 27 national parliaments, a process which could take some years, he has argued. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. The UK will continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making.Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Following Theresa May's Brexit recent speech we now know that the UK is not intending to stay in the EU's single market. Although there has been speculation for months about the issue, it would have meant the UK staying under the auspices of the European Court of Justice and having to allow unlimited EU immigration, under freedom of movement rules.Both sides want trade to continue after Brexit with the UK seeking a positive outcome for those who wish to trade goods and services"" - such as those in the City of London and wanting a ""comprehensive free trade deal"" giving the UK ""the greatest possible access"" to the single market. Mrs May says she wants the UK to reach a new customs union deal with the EU. A customs union is where countries agree not to impose tariffs on each others' goods and have a common tariff on goods coming in from elsewhere. The UK is currently part of the EU customs union but that stops the UK being able to do its own trade deals with other countries. Reality Check: How could customs union work?These terms have increasingly been used as debate focused on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people in order to maintain access to the EU single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result.The government has declined to give a firm guarantee about the status of EU nationals currently living in the UK, saying this is not possible without a reciprocal pledge from other EU members about the millions of British nationals living on the continent. EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, will be be able to stay, the chief civil servant at the Home Office has said. The rights of other EU nationals would be subject to negotiations on Brexit and the ""will of Parliament"", he added.A lot depends on the kind of deal the UK agrees with the EU. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions on EU nationals, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.Again, it depends on whether the UK government decides to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages. Citizens' Advice has reminded people their rights have not changed yet and asked anyone to contact them if they think they have been discriminated against following the Leave vote.Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested EU migrants who come to the UK as Brexit nears may not be given the right to stay. He has said there might have to be a cut-off point if there was a ""surge"" in new arrivals.People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote. The day-to-day spending impact is likely to be more significant. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it to remain at least 10% below where it was on 23 June, in the long term. This means imported goods will consequently get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have already been seen and the issue was most notably illustrated by the dispute between Tesco and Marmite's makers about whether prices would be put up or not in the stores.The latest UK inflation figures, for January, showed the CPI inflation rate rising to 1.8%, its highest level for two and a half years, with signs of more cost pressures set to feed through in the months to come.Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration.She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations. As mentioned above, the key issue is whether other EU nations will grant the UK access to the single market, if that is what it wants, while at the same time being allowed to restrict the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK.Mrs May has said she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. It is currently running at 330,000 a year, of which 184,000 are EU citizens, and 188,000 are from outside the EU - the figures include a 39,000 outflow of UK citizens.It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Liberal Democrats - who have just a handful of MPs - have vowed to halt Brexit and keep Britain in the EU if they were to win the next general election.Some commentators, including former House of Commons clerk Lord Lisvane, have argued that a further referendum would be needed to ratify whatever deal the UK hammers out with the EU, but there are few signs political leaders view this as a viable option.Yes. Theresa May has appeared keen to avoid a vote on her negotiating stance, to avoid having to give away her priorities, but Theresa May has said there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. It is worth mentioning that any deal also has to be agreed by the European Parliament - with British MEPs getting a chance to vote on it there.  While there could be limitations on British nationals' ability to live and work in EU countries, it seems unlikely they would want to deter tourists. There are many countries outside the European Economic Area, which includes the 28 EU nations plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway, that British citizens can visit for up to 90 days without needing a visa and it is possible that such arrangements could be negotiated with European countries.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. In theory, the government could, if it wanted, decide to change the colour, which is currently standardised for EU countries, says the BBC's Europe correspondent, Chris Morris.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketNo nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it is ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faces being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. A second independence referendum for the country is now ""highly likely"", she has said, although not in 2017. She has said she wants Scotland to stay in the single market and said Mrs May's decision to rule out the UK staying in the single market ""undoubtedly"" brings the referendum closer.Before his resignation Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said the impact in Northern Ireland would be ""very profound"" and that the whole island of Ireland should now be able to vote on reunification. But, speaking while she was still Northern Ireland Secretary, Theresa Villiers ruled out the call from Sinn Féin for a border poll, saying the circumstances in which one would be called did not exist. The land border is likely to be a key part of the Brexit talks. Theresa May said a priority for her would be negotiating a deal with the EU which allowed a common travel area between the UK and the Republic of Ireland.During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest. But his successor Theresa May has said she will keep it in place, at least for the current Parliament, which is due to last until 2020.So far there has been a cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. There are yet to be signs that rising inflation have worried the Bank of England  enough to consider raising interest rates.  But if that happened it would make mortgages and loans more expensive to repay - but would be good news for savers.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.Eurotunnel boss Jacques Gounon said last November the reintroduction of duty-free would be ""an incredible boost for my business"" but he later said  that remark had been ""light-hearted"". Erik Juul-Mortensen, president of the Tax Free World Association (TFWA) said after the referendum vote ""it is not possible to predict how Brexit will affect the duty free and travel retail industry, and it is wiser not to make assumptions about exactly what the impact will be.""  They are at the moment but no-one knows the longer term prospects for definite. The EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - is not an EU initiative. It was negotiated between countries within a group known as the European Economic Area, often simply referred to as the single market (plus Switzerland, which confusingly is not a member of the EEA, but has agreed access to the single market). Therefore, the future of Britons' EHIC cover could depend on whether the UK decided to sever ties with the EEA.Probably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report. In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two-thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.However, the UK government is committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, the UK government is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR. However, the EU has its own European Court of Justice, whose decisions are binding on EU institutions and member states.Its rulings have sometimes caused controversy in Britain and supporters of a Brexit have called for immediate legislation to curb its powers. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also cited sovereignty and democracy, and they wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Four of the biggest US banks have committed to helping maintain the City's position. But HSBC will move up to 1,000 jobs to Paris, the BBC understands. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Pest control firm Rentokil Initial says it could make £15m extra this year thanks to a weaker currency.Others are less optimistic. Hilary Jones, a director at UK cosmetics firm Lush said the company was ""terrified"" about the economic impact. She added that while the firm's Dorset factory would continue to produce goods for the UK market, products for the European market may be made at its new plant in Germany.Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After the Leave vote, the government will probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""As with most elements of the UK economy, not enough solid data has been published yet to accurately conclude the Brexit effect on house prices. Industry figures have pointed to ""uncertainty"" among buyers and sellers that could potentially change the housing market.So far, the most significant research has come from the respected Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which has published the conclusions of a survey of its members. This primarily records sentiment among surveyors.It found that house prices are expected to fall across the UK in the three months after the referendum vote. However, the dip in prices is only expected to persist over the 12 months from June in London and East Anglia, surveyors predict.House prices were already slowing in central London, owing to the fall-out from changes to stamp duty rules in April.Separate figures from property portal Rightmove suggested the average asking price of houses coming on to the market in England and Wales fell by 0.9%, or £2,647, in July compared with June. It said that agents had reported very few sales had fallen through as a result of the vote.Many potential first-time buyers would welcome a fall in house prices, with ownership among the young falling owing to affordability concerns. Investors in property, or those who have paid off a mortgage and hope to leave homes as inheritance would be unhappy with a long-term reduction in value.  Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law following the decision to leave the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" will not necessarily disappear overnight - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU means the UK will not be part of TTIP. It will have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Former Labour health secretary Lord Owen has said that because of TTIP (see answer above) the only way to protect the NHS from further privatisation was to get out of the EU."

Before housing costs are taken into account, working-age households still have higher incomes than pensioner households.News that pensioner households are now better off than working-age families was widely reported on Monday.There have been reports for some time that incomes for pensioners have been growing faster than those for working-age people, largely as a result of pensions being protected by the triple-lock, while many working-age benefits have been frozen.The triple-lock guarantees that pensions rise by the same as average earnings, the consumer price index, or 2.5%, whichever is the highest.But the report from the Resolution Foundation was the first suggestion that the retired had actually overtaken the working-age group.The figures referred to the ""typical pensioner household"", by which it meant the median, which is the household for which half of pensioner households have higher income and half of them have lower incomes.In this case, a pensioner household is one in which at least one member is of pension age or older (65 for men, 64 for women) whether or not that person is working. There can also be working people in a pensioner household.But the important factor that has been mentioned little in the coverage is that the measure of income that the Resolution Foundation is using is one for income after housing costs have been paid. Taking income after housing costs makes a huge difference because pensioner households are more likely to own their own homes and to have relatively small or paid-off mortgages.The report says, for example, that 70% of the silent generation (born 1926-45) own their homes outright, while just over 40% of the baby boomers (1946-65) own theirs, with another 30% still having mortgages to pay.    The median income for both working-age and pensioner households is just over £20,000 a year, so housing costs would make a big difference.Also, the figures do not take account of people in care homes, which would be expected to increase housing costs for those of pension age.The Resolution Foundation confirms in the report that before housing costs are paid, the median working-age household still has a higher income than the median pensioner household.

And if so when? Those whispered questions have been echoing between Labour MPs and party apparatchiks at Westminster for weeks, for months. But today the guessing game has risen to a new pitch.In BBC interviews, we have been given answers of a sort by two of the most prominent members of the shadow cabinet.Yes, the Labour leader could be replaced. And the change could take place at the next election, ""if and when"" Mr Corbyn decides he has had enough.This time, the helpful guidance was not contained in any unattributed, anonymous briefing from a ""senior MP"" or ""party source"", who may or may not be keen to hasten Mr Corbyn on his way. They were the words of the party's newly appointed election co-ordinator in the shadow cabinet, Ian Lavery.In an interview with me for BBC Radio 5 live's Pienaar's Politics, I asked Mr Lavery if a report in the Sunday Times newspaper was true - that the party had conducted focus group research to gauge the potential appeal of two shadow cabinet colleagues, Rebecca Long-Bailey and Angela Raynor, as potential future leadership candidates.His denial was as emphatic as it was unsurprising. It was, he said, ""political poppycock.""""I think they are fantastic candidates. We have got lots of quality in the Labour Party and it's not just the two who have been mentioned,"" he added.More interesting was what he said next. ""There's plenty of leaders to pick from, if and when Jeremy decides, of his own volition, that it's not for him at the election."" He concluded, again helpfully: ""That isn't the case at this point in time.""So, in the space of one brief moment, the man now appointed to guide Labour through what could become a torrid series of electoral tests has volunteered that, in his judgement, Mr Corbyn may conceivably decide to pass on the leadership ""at the election"". And that there had been no such decision on Mr Corbyn's part ""at this point in time"". All of which can only crank up the volume of whispered speculation.Against this background, the verdict of Tom Watson, Labour's deputy Labour leader, in his interview with Andrew Marr, perhaps becomes a little more intriguing. He told Marr the party ""has got the leadership settled for this Parliament"".As for the mood in the party, much depends on the coming Parliamentary by-elections in the once supposedly ""safe"" constituencies of Stoke-on-Trent Central and Copeland in Cumbria.The new election co-ordinator, who replaced Jon Trickett amid a certain unease at the state of Labour's readiness for the fights ahead, was upbeat. Upbeat, at least up to a point. ""If you look at them separately, they are both relatively positive at this moment in time, despite what he polls might say, despite what individuals might say,"" he said. It was not the most ringingly confident assessment I can remember from an election strategist.If Labour loses one or both of these seats, expect the present simmering unease in the party to approach boiling point once again."

I don't think so. The coverage of one MP's Early Day Motion (EDM) of no confidence in the Speaker, in the wake of his comments about President Trump, is massively over-egged. First, it's an EDM. They are a form of parliamentary graffiti - a way of expressing an opinion, and nestling amongst the 946 EDMs on such subjects as the Queen's sapphire jubilee, diplomatic relations with Armenia, the Battle of Cable St and organised dog fighting, it has so far attracted a single signature - although that might change when MPs return from their holidays. But the more important point about EDMs is that some special parliamentary acrobatics are needed for them to be debated on the floor of the Commons. The government could provide the time, but it won't. An opposition party could give up some of its allocated time, but they won't. The Backbench Business Committee, which controls its own block of Commons time, could allocate a slot - but it almost certainly won't.So no debate. But what if a large number of MPs do, eventually, sign it? Will a shamed Speaker Bercow retire to his state dining room with a bottle of his own-brand whisky and a loaded revolver? I strongly doubt it. This Speaker saw off a coup attempt on the last day of the 2010 Parliament, when the coalition whips attempted to change the rules on Speaker elections as a precursor to an attempt to unseat him after the general election. That vote was effectively a direct attack on the Speaker - and was supported by 202 MPs. Yet Speaker Bercow did not resign. Like another Marmite politician, he's a fighter, not a quitter. And no-one should make the mistake of assuming he is universally loathed by Tory MPs. The Bercow phenomenon is a complex thing. On the one hand, he's a hardline parliamentary moderniser. On a cosmetic level, he has ditched the grand gold-embroidered robes worn by his predecessors, and most recently, presided over the decision to abandon the court dress worn by the Commons Clerks. But more importantly, he has opened up the procedure of the House, with historically important results.A few months back I wrote about how his rulings provided the parliamentary openings that led to pro-Brexit MPs cornering David Cameron into conceding the EU referendum. But he has also allowed 353 Urgent Questions, putting ministers on the spot on topical issues, so that the Commons is visible on the TV news, debating the issues of the moment. In the 21st Century that is essential. MPs also appreciate his brisk conduct of question times, giving many more their moment in the Parliamentary limelight.But then there's the other side of the coin. His put-downs can be brutal, and Tory MPs believe he targets them more often than the opposition - although the Lib Dems, still smarting from the duffing up of their leader, Tim Farron, at PMQs the other week, might argue that they get swatted too. Where other Speakers might have poured on a little honey ""the Right Hon Gentleman who is a distinguished parliamentarian, should know better…"", Bercow's repartee - like his admonition to Tory Tim Loughton ""the children's minister should stop acting like a child"" - has not been forgotten or forgiven by its targets. His stand-up shouting match with the then government Chief Whip, Patrick McLoughlin, on the floor of the Commons, may be the most spectacular example of a loss of temper, but it's not the only one. To quote Kipling, the burnt Speaker's bandaged finger goes wabbling back to the fire. But there are plenty of reasons why I expect him to survive. First there is no Commons majority to remove him. Support for the Speaker may be the love that dare not speak its name in the Conservative 1922 Committee, but there is a solid phalanx of Bercow-supporting Tories out there. As one senior member of this elusive group put it, ""with this Speaker, you have to take the rough with the smooth"". They believe his failings are a price worth paying for a Speaker who they believe facilitates tough scrutiny of the government.Second, the government has learned the lesson of its attempt to remove him on 26 March 2015, and doesn't want to place its dabs on the dagger this time. And without a government whipping operation behind it, any direct attempt to topple the Speaker is doomed.Third, MPs want to protect the Office. This is a more subtle point. If the Speaker is to be dethroned, his successor will feel vulnerable from day one. They will be less willing to offend, not just ministers, but pretty much anyone. And that means the rights of individual MPs and backbench groupings like the pre-referendum Brexiteers to make life difficult, may be less diligently enforced. This argument convinces a lot of older hands who are not obvious Bercow backers on other grounds.Fourth, he's going anyway. Perhaps later in this Parliament than some may hope, but he's been in the Chair since 2009, and that's a pretty long spell. So why mount a putsch when success is not guaranteed and there's a price to be paid?So when the Bercow era does end, it will be at a time of his choosing."

Now Theresa May has her prize from the Commons, getting the Article 50 bill (she never wanted) through with no major changes, it makes its way to the red and gold end of the Palace of Westminster, to the Lords.The first debate is set for 20 February. More than 140 Peers have already put their names down to speak. But at that stage there probably won't be a vote. A week later the thornier more detailed committee stage begins. Then the last certain stage, the third reading and report is scheduled for 7 March. If it all goes according to the government's plan, which sources say is ""hugely unpredictable"", it would allow Theresa May to stick to her timetable and push the button for exit talks to start the next week, once the Bill has been rubber-stamped by the other Palace. (It's daft in this business to make too many predictions, but I d put a fiver on that happening on Wednesday 15 March.)The government will have a bumpier ride in the Lords after a grumpy process in the Commons. The Lords is dramatically different because the government most certainly does not have a majority among peers. And, it is the Lords' express purpose to scrutinise and if needed, improve draft laws before sending them back along the corridor to the Commons.Overnight a government source suggested that the Lords had better jolly well let the Brexit bill go through, or else. Despite the sabre-rattling though, the atmosphere in the Lords is less febrile than that language might suggest.Downing Street this morning tried to dampen down the aggressive briefing. And one source in the Lords described the threat as ""total BS"" - I'll leave you to work that out.The main opposition leader, Baroness Smith, has made it plain on several occasions that although the Lords may try to tweak the Bill, Labour, broadly, has no intention of trying to block it. Her modus operandi is to ""hold to account, not hold to ransom"".The Liberal Democrats are more intent on making changes in the Lords, for it is there they can wield power, rather than in the Commons. But unless they have the support of Labour too, there is a limit to how much trouble they can cause.The chatter suggests the Lords will push for concessions from the government over the rights of EU citizens to stay here, reporting the progress of negotiations regularly to Parliament and maybe on a final ""meaningful vote"" for both Houses on the deal.It will be up to the government to decide whether to tweak the bill slightly as they did in the Commons or risk some defeats. Insiders predict it is likely the Lords may end up sending back the bill to the Commons once, as ""ping pong"" to force the government to make a change or two. But even senior Lib Dem sources don't expect hostile stand-offs for weeks on end. The Lords will make their voices heard, there is no question about that and the Article 50 bill could run into trouble. It would be wrong to suggest that ministers don't anticipate a tricky time. But today at least, whatever the sabre-rattling from some parts of government, this historic piece of legislation looks likely to be the subject of a few skirmishes in the Lords, rather than an apocalyptic battle.

2017-02-12,Ward-by ward,https://web.archive.org//web/20170213180622/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38762034,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe BBC has obtained a more localised breakdown of votes from nearly half of the local authorities which counted EU referendum ballots last June.This information provides much greater depth and detail in explaining the pattern of how the UK voted. The key findings are:A statistical analysis of the data obtained for over a thousand individual local government wards confirms how the strength of the local Leave vote was strongly associated with lower educational qualifications.Wards where the population had fewer qualifications tended to have a higher Leave vote, as shown in the chart. If the proportion of the local electorate with a degree or similar qualification was one percentage point lower, then on average the leave vote was higher by nearly one percentage point.Using ward-level data means we can compare voting figures in this way to the local demographic information collected in the 2011 census. Of the main census statistics, this is the one with the greatest association with how people voted. In statistical terms the level of educational qualifications explains about two-thirds of the variation in the results between different wards. The correlation is strong, whether based on assessing graduate and equivalent qualifications or lower-level ones. This ward-by-ward analysis covers 1,070 individual wards in England and Wales whose boundaries had not changed since the 2011 census, about one in nine of the UK's wards. We had very little ward-level data from Scotland, and none from Northern Ireland.It should be noted, however, that many ward counts also included some postal votes from across the counting area, and therefore some variation between wards will have been masked by the random allocation of postal votes for counting. This makes the results less accurate geographically, but we can still use the information to explore broad national and local patterns.  Adding age as a second factor significantly helps to further explain voting patterns. Older populations were more likely to vote Leave. Education and age combined account for nearly 80% of the voting variation between wards. Ethnicity is a smaller factor, but one which also contributed to the results. Adding that in means that now 83% of the variation in the vote between wards is explained. White populations were generally more pro-Leave, and ethnic minorities less so.  However, there were some interesting differences between London and elsewhere.The ethnic dimension is particularly interesting when examining the outliers on the graph that compares the Leave vote to levels of education.There are numerous wards towards the bottom left of the graph where electorates with lower educational qualifications nevertheless produced low Leave and high Remain votes. This is where the link between low qualifications and Leave voting breaks down. It turns out that these exceptional wards have high ethnic minority populations, particularly in Birmingham and Haringey in north London. In contrast, there are virtually no dramatic outliers on the other side of the line, where comparatively highly educated populations voted Leave. Only one point on the graph stands out - this is Osterley and Spring Grove in Hounslow, west London, a mainly ethnic minority ward which had a Leave vote of 63%. While this figure does include some postal votes, they are not nearly enough to explain away this unusual outcome.In fact, in Ealing and Hounslow, west London boroughs with many voters of Asian origin, the ethnic correlation was in the other direction to the national picture: a higher number of Asian voters was associated with a higher Leave vote.This powerful link to educational attainment could stem from the lower qualified tending to feel less confident about their prospects and ability to compete for work in a competitive globalised economy with high levels of migration. On the other hand some commentators see it as primarily reflecting a ""culture war"" or ""values conflict"", rather than issues of economics and inequality. Research shows that non-graduates tend to take less liberal positions than graduates on a range of social issues from immigration and multi-culturalism to the death penalty.   The former campaign director of Vote Leave, Dominic Cummings, argues that the better educated are more prone to holding irrational political opinions because they are more driven by fashion and a group mentality. Of course this assessment does not imply that Leave voters were almost all poorly educated and old, and Remain voters well educated and young. The Leave side obviously attracted support from many middle class professionals, graduates and younger people. Otherwise it couldn't have won. While there was undoubtedly a lot of voting which cut across these criteria, the point of this analysis is to explore how different social groups most probably voted - and it is clear that education, age and ethnicity were crucial influences.  After these three key factors are taken into account, adding in further demographic measures from the census does little to increase the explanation of UK-wide voting patterns. However, this does not reflect the distinctively more pro-Remain voting in Scotland, since we are short of Scottish data at this geographical level. It is clear as well that in a few specific locations high student numbers were also very relevant. To a certain extent, using the level of educational qualifications as a measure combines both class and age factors, with working class and older adults both tending to be less well qualified.But the association between education and the voting results is stronger than the association between social or occupational class and the results. This is still true after taking the age of the local population into account.This suggests that voters with lower qualifications were more likely to back Leave than the better qualified, even when they were in the same social or occupational class.The existence of a significant connection between Leave voting and lower educational qualifications had already been suggested by analysis of the published referendum results from the official counting areas.The data we have obtained strengthens this conclusion, because voting patterns can now be compared to social statistics from the 2011 census at a much more detailed geographical level than by the earlier studies. The BBC analysis is also consistent with opinion polling (for example, from Lord Ashcroft, Ipsos Mori and YouGov) that tried to identify the characteristics of Leave and Remain voters.  The data we have collected can be used to illustrate the sort of places where the Leave and Remain camps did particularly well: it is hard to imagine a more glaring social contrast than that between the deprived, poorly educated housing estates of Brambles and Thorntree in Middlesbrough, and the privileged elite colleges of Market ward in central Cambridge. It is important to bear in mind, however, that most of the voting figures mentioned below also include some postal votes, so they should be treated as approximate rather than precise.  It is also important to note that the examples are limited to the places for which we were able to obtain localised information, which was only a minority of areas. The rest of the country may well contain even starker instances.Of the 1,283 individual wards for which we have data, the highest Leave vote was 82.5% in Brambles and Thorntree, a section of east Middlesbrough with many social problems. Ward boundaries have changed since the 2011 census, but in that survey the Thorntree part of the area had the lowest proportion of people with a degree or similar qualification of anywhere in England and Wales, at only 5%. And according to Middlesbrough council, the figure for the current Brambles and Thorntree ward is even lower, at just 4%. Second highest was 80.3% in Waterlees Village, a poor locality within Wisbech, Cambridgeshire. This area has seen a major influx of East European migrants who have been doing low-paid work in nearby food processing factories and farms, with tensions between them and British residents. Other wards with available data which had the strongest Leave votes were congregated in Middlesbrough, Canvey Island in Essex, Skegness in coastal Lincolnshire, and Havering in east London.The highest Remain vote was 87.8% in Market ward in central Cambridge, an area with numerous colleges and a high student population, in a city which was strongly pro-Remain.This was followed by Ashley ward  (85.6%) in central Bristol, a district featuring ethnic diversity, gentrification and alternative culture.Next highest was Northumberland Park (85.0%) in Haringey, north London, which has a substantial black population. Other wards with available data which had the strongest Remain votes were generally located in Cambridge, Bristol and the multi-ethnic London boroughs of Haringey and Lambeth. The count for Ashburton in Croydon, south London, split 50-50 exactly, with both Leave and Remain getting 3,885 votes, but that did include some postal ballots.As for being nearest to the overall result, the combined count of Tulketh and University, neighbouring wards near the centre of Preston, was 51.92% for leave, very close to the UK wide figure of 51.89%. The individual ward of Barnwood in Gloucester had Leave at 51.94%. Both figures however contain some postal votes.Given that a few councils provided even more detailed data down to the level of polling districts, it is possible to identify some very small localities that were nicely representative of the national picture. The 527 voters in the neighbouring districts of Kirk Langley and Mackworth in Amber Valley in Derbyshire, whose two ballot boxes were counted together, produced a leave proportion of 51.99%. And this figure is not contaminated by any postal votes.So journalists (or anyone else for that matter) who seek a microcosm of the UK should perhaps visit the Mundy Arms pub in Mackworth, the location for that district's polling station.Similarly, the 427 voters in the combined neighbouring polling districts of Chiddingstone Hoath and Hever Four Elms to the south of Sevenoaks in Kent delivered a leave vote of 51.6% (again, without any postal votes).The data obtained points to 269 areas of various sizes (wards, clusters of wards or constituencies) which had a different Leave/Remain outcome compared to the official counting area of which they were part.This consists of 150 areas which backed Remain but were part of Leave-voting counting areas; and 119 in the other direction. The detailed information therefore gives us an understanding of how the electorate voted which is more variegated than the officially published results.Every one of Scotland's 32 counting areas came down on the Remain side. Yet, despite the fact that most Scottish councils did not give us much detailed information, we can nevertheless identify a few smaller parts of the country which actually backed Leave.A cluster of six wards in the Banff and Buchan area in north Aberdeenshire had a strong Leave majority of 61%. There is much local discontent within the fishing industry of this coastal district about the EU's common fisheries policy.An Taobh Siar agus Nis, a ward at the northern end of the Isle of Lewis in Na h-Eileanan an Iar (Western Isles), also voted Leave, if very narrowly. And at a smaller geographical level, in Shetland the 567 voters in the combined polling districts of Whalsay and South Unst had an extremely high Leave vote of 81%. The island of Whalsay is a fishing community, where EU rules have been controversial and in 2012 numerous skippers were heavily fined for major breaches of fishing quotas.Ealing and Hounslow are neighbouring multi-ethnic boroughs in the west of London with large Asian populations, where - in contrast to the national picture - non-white ethnicity was associated with voting Leave, particularly in Ealing. Both boroughs shared a varied internal pattern of prosperous largely white areas voting strongly Remain, poorer largely white areas preferring Leave, and the Asian areas tending to be more evenly split.Ealing voted 60% Remain, with Southfield ward hitting 76%, but in contrast the Southall wards which are over 90% ethnic minority were close to 50-50.In Hounslow the richer wards in Chiswick in the east of the area voted heavily Remain (73%), but the poorer largely white wards at the opposite western end in Feltham and Bedfont voted Leave (64-66%). Osterley and Spring Grove was also 63% Leave, the highest Leave vote in any individual ward in the UK with a non-white majority for which we have data. The south London borough of Bromley narrowly voted Remain. Those parts which did not do so by a significant margin were the Cray Valley wards, largely poor white working class areas; and Biggin Hill and Darwin wards, locations to the south which contain more open countryside and lie outside the built-up commuter belt. In Croydon in south London, places which voted Leave by substantial amounts were New Addington and Fieldway, neighbouring wards with large council estates. Beyond the areas with the strongest backing for Leave and Remain, examining the detailed breakdown of votes in various places gives greater insight into the pattern of support for the two sides - as can be seen from the following examples.In several places (for example, Birmingham, Bristol, Nottingham, Portsmouth) there was a strong contrast between the Leave-voting populations of large, rundown, predominantly white, housing estates in the urban periphery, versus Remain-voting populations in inner city areas with large numbers of ethnic minorities and sometimes students.Birmingham had several wards with large Remain votes, although the city as a whole narrowly voted Leave.  These pro-Remain wards tended to be the more highly educated, better off localities, or minority ethnic areas which strongly backed Remain despite low levels of educational qualifications. I have written about this before. In Blackburn with Darwen, Bastwell ward had the highest Remain vote at 65%, compared to only 44% in the area as a whole. This ward has an ethnic minority proportion of over 90%. Other Blackburn wards which voted Remain were also ones with high minority populations.Bradford voted to Leave (54%), but the area included some starkly contrasting places which went over 60% Remain: the prosperous, genteel, spa town of Ilkley, and strongly ethnic minority wards in the city, such as Manningham and Toller.Bristol voted strongly Remain on the whole (62%), but there were some striking exceptions, particularly the large, deprived, mainly white estates to the south of the city. Hartcliffe and Withywood backed Leave at 67%. Similar neighbouring wards (Hengrove and Whitchurch Park, Filwood, Bishopsworth and Stockwood) also voted Leave, as did the more industrial area of Avonmouth and Lawrence Weston to the north west of the city.As a county Cornwall voted to Leave. But one of its six parliamentary constituencies, Truro and Falmouth, voted 53% to Remain, possibly linked to a significant student population.In Lincoln, which voted 57% to Leave, Carholme ward stands out as very different - it voted 63% to Remain. This ward includes Lincoln University, and 43% of the residents are students Middlesbrough voted 65% to Leave. As already noted, it had several wards with extremely high leave votes of over 75%. But one ward, Linthorpe, voted very narrowly to Remain - a comparatively well-to-do inner suburb which includes an art college; and another ward, Central, which contains Teesside University, nearly did. Mole Valley in Surrey exhibited a dramatic contrast between two neighbouring districts with very different demographics and housing. The highest Remain vote was in the very prosperous location of Dorking South, which voted 63% Remain, but the neighbouring ward of Holmwoods, dominated by large estates on the edge of the town of Dorking, voted 57% Leave, the area's highest Leave vote. Nottingham voted narrowly to Leave, but the inner city ward of Radford and Park voted 68% Remain. This has both a comparatively high proportion of ethnic minorities and considerable numbers of students from two nearby universities. There was a lot of variation within the area. Bulwell - a market town to the north of the city with many social problems - voted 69% Leave  There was also a high Leave vote in the housing estate locations of the Clifton wards in the south of Nottingham.Oldham voted to Leave at 61%, but Werneth, the city ward with the highest ethnic minority population, voted Remain (57%). Other wards with high minority populations also voted Remain.In Oxford the cluster of polling districts which included Blackbird Leys and other deprived estates on the southern edge of the city voted to Leave at 51%. In contrast the central areas containing colleges, university buildings and student accommodation voted to Remain at over 80%.Plymouth voted 60% Leave, but Drake ward which includes the university had the city's highest Remain vote at 56%. Portsmouth was another place with wide variation. Paulsgrove ward, with its large estate on the edge of the city, had the highest Leave vote at 70%, whereas at the other end of the spectrum Central Southsea, an inner city ward and student area, voted 57% Remain.Rochdale voted 60% Leave. The place which bucked this trend by voting 59% Remain, Milkstone and Deeplish, was the most predominantly ethnic minority ward. Central Rochdale had the second highest Remain vote and is the other ward that is mainly not white. Walsall voted strongly Leave (68%). The only ward which voted Remain, Paddock, is both a comparatively prosperous and multi-ethnic locality.A few councils released their data at remarkably localised levels, down even to individual polling districts (ie ballot boxes) in the case of Blackburn with Darwen and Bracknell Forest, or clusters of two/three/four districts, in the case of Amber Valley, Brentwood, Sevenoaks, Shetland, South Oxfordshire, and Tewkesbury.This provides very local and specific data, in some cases just for neighbourhoods of hundreds of voters.At its most detailed this reveals that the 110 people who cast their votes in the ballot box at St. Alban's Primary School in central Blackburn split 56-52 in favour of Remain, with two spoilt papers.It also discloses stark contrasts in some neighbouring locations. The 953 people who voted at Little Harwood community centre in north Blackburn had a Leave vote of only 31%, while the 336 electors who voted in the neighbouring ballot box at Roe Lee Park primary school produced a Leave percentage over twice as high, at 64%.The very detailed data we obtained also provides some rare evidence on the views of postal compared to non-postal voters. Campaign strategists have often deliberated on whether the two groups vote differently and should be given separate targeted messages.Most places mixed boxes of postal and non-postal votes for counting, so generally it's not possible to draw comparative conclusions. However there were a few exceptions which recorded them separately, or included a very small number of non-postal votes with the postals.These figures indicate that postal voters were narrowly less likely to back Leave than voters in polling stations. Data covering five counting areas with about 260,000 votes shows that in these places the roughly one in five electors who voted by post backed Leave at 55.4%, one percentage point lower than the local non-postal support for Leave of 56.4%.The counting areas involved are Amber Valley, East Cambridgeshire, Gwynedd, Hyndburn and North Warwickshire.Since the referendum the BBC has been trying to get the most detailed, localised voting data we could from each of the counting areas.  This was a major data collection exercise carried out by my colleague George Greenwood. We managed to obtain voting figures broken down into smaller geographical units for 178 of the 399 referendum counting areas (380 councils in England, Wales and Scotland, with a separate tally in Gibraltar, while in Northern Ireland results were issued for the 18 constituencies). This varied between data for individual local government wards, wards grouped into clusters, and constituency level data. In a few cases the results supplied were even more localised than ward level. Overall the extra data covers a wide range of different areas and kinds of councils across the UK. Electoral returning officers are not covered by the Freedom of Information Act, so releasing the information was up to the discretion of councils. While some were very willing, in other cases it required a lot of persistence and persuasion. Some councils could not supply any detailed data because they mixed all ballot boxes prior to counting; some did possess more local figures but simply refused to disclose them to us. Others did provide data, but the combinations in which ballot boxes were mixed before counting were too complex to fit ward boundaries neatly.A few places such as Birmingham released their ward by ward data following the referendum on their own initiative, but in most cases the information had to be obtained by us requesting it directly, and sometimes repeatedly, from the authority."

The government has now specified what would count as exceptional circumstances. It is not clear whether the new rules will be more or less strict than just letting councils decide what counted as exceptional circumstances. The government has described the housing market as broken, promised more affordable homes and said it would help people to buy and rent.A big question in discussions of increasing the supply of homes is whether planning regulations will be changed to make it easier to build on green belt land.Green belts were introduced after World War Two to stop cities from sprawling and countryside being spoilt. About 13% of England is now covered.This covers scenic sites open to the public, such as the Chiltern Hills and North Downs, but it also covers a lot of land that has limited public access and may not be particularly beautiful.In the House of Commons, Communities Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""In 2015, we promised the British people that the green belt was safe in our hands and that is still the case.""So what has changed?There has been little variation in the amount of green belt land since 1997, although data is not available for every year.The Housing White Paper says the current planning regulations allow building on the green belt only ""in exceptional circumstances"" but that there is no detail given of what would amount to exceptional circumstances.The government has now specified that before allowing development on green belt land, councils would need to rule out options including: The White Paper also says that councils allowing the boundaries of green belt land to be changed would have to make up for it by improving other bits of green belt. It also asks for suggestions of other things councils should take into account before doing so. Read more from Reality Check"

The veteran Gaullist already has form.When he was Commissioner for the Internal Market and Financial Services, Mr Barnier was dubbed ""the most dangerous man in Europe"" after taking on the banking sector and championing a cap on bankers' bonuses. But while he alarmed some in the City, and will probably do so again, he also won grudging respect as a tough but even-handed negotiator.He will need all those skills and more in his new role - chief Brexit negotiator at the European Commission. And having moved seamlessly between big jobs in Paris and Brussels - French foreign minister, Commissioner, MEP - he looks well prepared. ""Don't ask me to tell you what will be at the end of the road, we haven't begun to walk yet,"" he told a conference in Brussels last month. Mr Barnier will stick closely to the official EU position of ""no negotiation without notification"" - waiting for the UK to trigger Article 50 to start the formal process of withdrawal. But he's clearly eager to get going.""I am waiting to begin,"" he said. ""I will be ready tomorrow to negotiate, frankly speaking.""And he will bring with him an instinctive pro-European agenda, and a deep knowledge of the workings of the single market.His deputy as chief Brexit negotiator is a German trade expert, Sabine Weyand, adding to the impression that Mr Barnier will lead a team that means business.One of the biggest challenges he (and his boss Jean-Claude Juncker) faces, is to ensure that representatives of the big member states don't sideline him in the Brexit divorce negotiations.But Mr Barnier's long career in French politics means he could well have the ear of the Elysee Palace, especially if - as looks likely - a centre-right candidate wins the French presidency next year. The stakes are so high that there are bound to be some clashes.Mr Barnier has sparred with the UK's Minister for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, before, when the men both served as Europe ministers in the 1990s. It is another reminder that Michel Barnier is a politician first and foremost, rather than a bureaucrat. There have certainly been criticisms - a dash of vanity, a lack of attention to detail. His career has had plenty of downs as well as ups.But he will defend his European vision to the end, and the British government would do well not to underestimate him.At the height of the eurozone crisis, Mr Barnier always refused (politely) to do broadcast interviews in English.""One wrong word,"" he told me once with a smile, ""and we could move markets.""The next few years will be equally challenging."

Scotland voted 62% in favour of Remain.The conversation online was being driven overwhelmingly by pro-independence campaigners. But people who had supported ""Better Together"" during the Scottish referendum vote also spoke about the possibility of a break-away from the UK as a result of the vote over EU membership.  Perhaps the most significant was Scottish author JK Rowling who tweeted: ""Scotland will seek independence now. Cameron's legacy will be breaking up two unions. Neither needed to happen.""Many took to Twitter to express new or strengthened pro-independence feelings in the wake of the latest vote (Just as a reminder: a ""Yes"" vote in Scotland's 2014 referendum was for independence, while the winning ""No"" campaign backed staying in the UK).One old tweet from 2014's independence referendum gained new life on Friday.

""Whether it is a question of migratory birds, managing our oceans or air pollution, the environment transcends political boundaries and the UK's environment and Europe's will remain inextricably linked,"" said its chair, Lib Dem peer Lord Teverson.""The bottom line is that if the UK fails to honour environmental law, it will end up in court...  We are not convinced that the government has yet found a way to deliver the continuity of environmental protection that we all want to achieve.""It said an independent enforcement mechanism would still be needed, underpinned by a system of judicial oversight, to ensure central government, businesses and households live up to their environmental obligations.Even if the UK left the single market, businesses would still have to comply with basic environmental obligations if they wanted to trade with the EU, it argued.The committee is pressing the government to clarify whether funding for scientific research and sustainable infrastructure currently available through the European Investment Bank will continue after the UK leaves the EU.It also suggested that after Brexit, the UK would have to align itself with other like-minded countries outside the EU to ensure it remained an advocate for global action to tackle the effects of climate change.""The UK has been a world leader but in leaving the EU, we lose our strongest allies,"" the report said.Environment Secretary Andrea Leadsom has said Brexit is a chance to do away with needless bureaucracy, such as rules on how many crops farmers must plant each year, while upholding environmental and animal welfare standards.Her department has launched a consultation on a 25-year plan for the environment, focused on developing policies ""tailored to the needs of the UK, our species and our habitats"", including wildlife protections and sensitive management of farmland.Responding to the report, a Defra spokesman said: ""Our ambition is to be the first generation to leave the environment in a better state than we found it.""We are committed to building on our long history of wildlife and environmental protection and securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU."""

The key points of her speech were:The current rate of re-offending within a year of conviction is 25.3%.Speaking to the Centre for Social Justice, Ms Truss said: ""Reductions by cap or quota, or by sweeping sentencing cuts are not a magic bullet, they are a dangerous attempt at a quick fix.""The most recent figures put the population of inmates in England and Wales at 85,490 in 2016 - up from 50,962 on average in 1995.Put prisoner safety first, charities sayWhat is going wrong with the prison system?Ms Truss said more sex offenders were being sent to prison as sentence lengths ""better reflect the severity"" of crimes like domestic violence, rape and child abuse.She rejected calls by Labour officials to reduce the number of prisoners in England and Wales by half, warning that such a move would be ""reckless"" and ""endanger the public"".Ms Truss said courts needed to be given the right tools to intervene before prison was an option.""There can never be an excuse for committing crime but too often people end up in prison because our interventions to tackle problems like drug addiction or mental health issues don't work as well as they should,"" she added.""Community sentences are most effective when they tackle the problems that contribute to the offender's crime."" The justice secretary said the Prison and Courts Bill - due to be published this month - will ""enshrine in law that reforming offenders is a key purpose of prison and that the Secretary of State has a responsibility for delivering it"".""This will usher in the biggest reform of our prisons in a generation. It will transform our prisons from offender warehouses to disciplined and purposeful centres of reform,"" she added.After her speech, Ms Truss said she would be meeting with the family of Dean Saunders, who died in Chelmsford Prison after he was found electrocuted in his cell.Andrew Neilson, spokesman for the Howard League for Penal Reform, said the justice secretary needed to act to get prison numbers down quickly.""She wants to reduce prison numbers in a long-term way through tackling reoffending but she won't look at sentencing reform to actually try and get numbers down quickly,"" he told the BBC.""And I'm afraid that without that sentencing reform we are going to continue to have ministers making similar speeches bemoaning the violence and the deaths in prisons because we will not get a solution without doing something about prison numbers."""

Official discussions on the terms of the UK's exit and its future relationship with the EU are expected to begin in the Spring once the UK has triggered Article 50 - notifying the union of its intention to leave.Prime Minister Theresa May has made clear that the UK will leave the EU's single market and wants bespoke commercial and customs agreements based on tariff-free and ""frictionless"" cross-border trade.  She has also made clear that she is prepared to leave the EU without a formal deal rather sign up to a bad one.The final agreement on the UK's exit will need the approval of 20 out of the EU's 27 other member states as well as the support of the European Parliament. However, a future trade deal could need the backing of all EU states.There have been suggestions the UK could potentially exploit divisions within the EU over how hard a bargain they are willing to drive.Several EU leaders have insisted the UK cannot expect a better deal outside the EU than it has now and their priority is to protect the interests of the remaining 27 members. Others have advised against ""punishing"" the UK. Speaking after holding talks with Austrian Chancellor Christian Kern, Mr Juncker said there would be no parallel negotiations and the UK would not be allowed to conduct bilateral discussions in key areas such as finance, telecommunications or chemicals.""A situation could arise whereby the UK might attempt to or wish to be obliging to certain member states in certain economic zones and certain sectors whereby those countries might wish to provide certain advantages to the UK,"" he said.""It is in our interests therefore that we don't have any special discussions... with certain individual countries.""Mr Kern said that Europe would not ""capitulate"" to the UK by granting it a better status than it would enjoy if it was still an EU member.""If you want to be a member of a club you have better conditions, obviously, than if you want to be outside the club,"" he said.The EU's negotiating team will be headed up by former commissioner Michel Barnier.Speaking during a visit to Finland his UK counterpart, Brexit Secretary David Davis, said he wanted an outcome which was good for the EU as well as the UK.""We're not talking about a break-up, we're talking about a new relationship, that's what we want to see,"" he said. The UK's former ambassador to the EU Sir Ivan Rogers has said the negotiations - which are scheduled to be completed in two years - will be ""humungous"" in scope.Preparatory work has been taking place in more than 50 different sectors, spanning manufacturing and services as well as key industries such as farming and fishing."
2017-02-13,UK aid shift to 'empower' poor nations,https://web.archive.org//web/20170214031941/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38959997,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkPlans to spend more overseas aid promoting Britain's strategic national interests have been criticised by MPs. A new cross-Whitehall fund is being set up to help poor nations counter Russian influence and Islamic extremism. But some MPs fear that this could mean less money spent on relieving poverty in Africa and Asia. The government's continuing commitment to spend 0.7%, more than £12bn, of its national income on overseas aid every year is controversial.To address concerns about value for money in aid spending at a time of austerity, ministers want to spend more of the money not only relieving poverty but also promoting Britain's strategic interests. As such, they are developing a new so-called ""empowerment fund"" worth £700m over four years. This could be used by the Foreign Office and other departments to help developing countries counter the threat of Islamic extremism or the clout of Russia.This could mean, say, more training for Ukraine in cyber defence - or more education for Syrian refugees in the Middle East. Nadhim Zahawi, a Conservative member of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, welcomed the idea. ""If this sort of fund will help push back and allow communities to be stabilised then I think it's a good thing,"" he said. ""Stability directly feeds into peoples' livelihoods, education, all the things that development should be quite rightly backing.""But others MPs fear the new fund could divert money away from helping the poorest countries in Africa and Asia.""These cross government funds which have a lot less scrutiny, a lot less transparency than the work that's done through the Department for International Development, I think, are an increasing concern,"" says Stephen Doughty, a Labour member of the Commons International Development Committee.""And unfortunately it's quite clear the money isn't necessarily being spent as well as it should be, ironically, as we're diverting it away from the department that does spend it well.""The new fund is being driven by Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson.His civil servants have long envied the bulging coffers of the Department for International Development whose officials have, in turn, long doubted the ability of the Foreign Office to spend aid effectively. But the government wants UK aid tied more closely to UK national interests so it can take on its critics who think Britain spends too much on aid, full stop. "

Talking to Reading students, Mr Bercow said: ""Personally, I voted to remain. I thought it was better to stay in the European Union than not.""He said this was ""partly for economic reasons - being part of a big trade bloc - and partly because I think we're in a world of power blocs.""I think for all the weaknesses and deficiencies of the European Union, it's better to be part of that big power bloc in the world than thinking you can act as effectively on your own.""He also said immigration was a good thing and expressed concern Labour had not done more to strike a ""very clear, resonant Remain note"".When he was elected Speaker in 2009, Mr Bercow said he would serve for no more than nine years.Responding to the row over his Brexit comments, his spokeswoman said he had voted in  June's referendum ""along with millions of others"".""The record shows that he has rigorously facilitated the raising of concerns of those on both sides of this argument, as he does on every other issue,"" she said.""The Speaker's impartiality is required on matters of debate before the House, and he has been scrupulous in ensuring that both sides of the argument are always heard.""Asked if the prime minister thought Mr Bercow was doing a good job, her spokesman said: ""The Speaker is a matter for MPs, he's the elected chairman of the House of Commons, he's not a member of the government, he's not appointed by the government.""He represents all the MPs in the House of Commons. It's up to them to decide whether they feel he's doing a good job or not."""
2017-02-13,MPs reject grammars as 'distraction',https://web.archive.org//web/20170214031941/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-38956439,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe government has failed to make a convincing case for opening a new wave of grammar schools in England, say MPs.The education select committee has cast doubt on claims that they can help social mobility.There is also scepticism about whether an entrance test for grammars can be made ""tutor proof"".Neil Carmichael, the committee's chair, says the focus on expanding grammars has become an ""unnecessary distraction"" from improving the school system.The Department for Education has argued that removing the ban on opening new grammars will be a way of making ""more good school places available, to more parents, in more parts of the country"".The cross-party committee of MPs, responding to the evidence gathered about plans to increase selective education, said ministers still needed to demonstrate how this would improve social mobility and close the gap between rich and poor pupils.MPs said there had been no convincing evidence that a test could be devised which would not favour those who could afford private coaching.As such they argued that such tests should not be the only criteria for entry.The MPs also raised concerns about how an expansion of grammars would affect other non-selective schools, in terms of funding and the supply of teachers.The committee called on the government to carry out an assessment of the potential impact on the wider school system.Head teachers wrote to MPs last week to express their ""incredulity"" that grammar schools were being offered extra funds to expand places, while they were facing job cuts because of deepening pressures on their budgets.The cross-party committee also highlighted the vagueness of the plans so far - with no clear outline of how many grammar schools would be created or how local demand for such grammars would be measured.There were also questions about whether this push for academic selection should be a priority when there had been so many concerns about vocational skills shortages.""The focus on opening new grammar schools is, in my view, an unnecessary distraction from the need to ensure all our young people are equipped with the skills to compete in the modern workplace,"" said Mr Carmichael.Since the prime minister last year announced the ambition to create new grammars, there have been few details of how this might be put into practice.But last week the Grammar School Heads' Association published details of a private meeting with education ministers, where they discussed options for expanding selection.This suggested that new grammar schools could open from 2020 - but in the meantime there would be £150m funding to expand existing grammars or to introduce grammar streams through academy trusts.There was also a suggestion that these new grammars would be much more selective than traditional grammars, with places for the top 10% of the ability range.Another idea was that there would be a single national entry test for grammars, rather than a range of local tests, with the aim of designing an exam that would be more resistant to coaching by private tutors.A Department for Education spokeswoman said that grammar schools have a ""track record of closing the attainment gap to almost zero between children on free school meals and their better off classmates"".The spokeswoman said that ""99% of grammar schools are rated good or outstanding; and even when you take higher ability intakes into account pupils still perform better in selective schools than in non-selective schools"". Labour's shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, said: ""When even the Conservative-dominated education select committee calls Theresa May's new grammar schools an 'unnecessary distraction', it's time that ministers finally sat up and took notice.""There is a crisis in teacher recruitment, schools budgets are being cut for the first time in decades and hundreds of thousands of pupils are in super-sized classes. The Tories should be keeping their pledge to protect school funding rather than pressing ahead with this policy,"" she said.John Pugh, the Liberal Democrats' education spokesman, said: ""Instead of ploughing ahead with these divisive plans, Theresa May should address the £3bn funding black hole facing our schools over the next five years.""Sir Peter Lampl, founder of the Sutton Trust, backed the calls for the government to show evidence that new grammars could close the attainment gap - when less than 3% of grammar school entrants are eligible for free school meals.""Until existing grammar schools demonstrate they can be vehicles for social mobility, the number of grammar schools should not be increased,"" said Sir Peter."
2017-02-13,Pensioners 'now better off than workers',https://web.archive.org//web/20170214031941/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-38948369,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkTypical pensioner incomes after housing costs now outstrip those of working-age people, a new report suggests.The Resolution Foundation also says pensioners are more likely than their predecessors to be working, own a home and have generous private pensions.The think tank says growth in pensioner incomes has been coupled with weak income growth for working-age people.Pensioner households are now £20 a week better off than working age households, but were £70 a week worse off in 2001.Reality Check: Are pensioners better off than workers?Pensions, parents and children: Am I better off?However, the report, called As Time Goes By, adds: ""This strong growth is not the result of a boom time for all pensioners, with most finding that their personal situation changes little from year to year. ""It says while typical incomes across the pensioner population have grown by more than 30% since 2001, the typical income of someone who turned 65 in that year was only 7% higher by 2014.Adam Corlett, economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: ""The main driver of pensioner income growth has been the arrival of successive new waves of pensioners, who are more likely to work, own their home and have generous private pension wealth than any previous generation.""Of course, not all pensioners can draw on these income sources, which is why the state pension will always be the main income for many pensioners. ""We can't assume either that young people today will be able to draw upon the kind of wealth that recent pensioners have accumulated, given the recent fall in home ownership and decline in generous defined benefit schemes.""The report identifies four key drivers of growth in typical pensioner incomes since the 2000s.These are: the possession of occupational pensions, a growth in the numbers in employment, increased state benefits, and a move towards home ownership from renting. But the Resolution Foundation warns that future generations of pensioners cannot assume that they will benefit from further gains from these income sources.Other findings include:Lord David Willetts - an executive chair of the Resolution Foundation and former Conservative minister - said that the ""triple-lock"" pension policy of successive governments should be reviewed. The triple-lock guarantees pensions rise by the same as average earnings, the consumer price index, or 2.5%, whichever is the highest.""Of course there has to be some kind of framework for increasing the state pension,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme. ""But the [triple-lock] is a very powerful ratchet pushing up pensions at a time when incomes of the less affluent half of working households are barely rising at all."" He added: ""I actually think pensioners worry about their kids and grandchildren. They don't want to live in a society where all the big increases in incomes are accruing to pensioners and other groups are being left behind.""  He said the government needed to look at ways of improving younger people's ""pension rights"" and chances of owning their own homes.""These are all things that have enabled today's pensioners to be so prosperous,"" he said."
2017-02-13,Undercover filming reveals prison chaos,https://web.archive.org//web/20170214031941/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-38931580,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkChaos in one of the biggest prisons in the country has been revealed in secret filming for the BBC.An undercover reporter spent two months at HMP Northumberland, which houses up to 1,348 male inmates, for Panorama. He discovered widespread drug use, a lack of control, door alarms that did not go off in one block and a hole in an internal security fence. The Ministry of Justice said it would investigate the ""extremely serious allegations"" at the Acklington jail.Prison officers also found balaclavas, blackout clothing and wire-cutting tools at the category C jail.It is believed inmates had been sneaking out to collect drugs or other contraband thrown over the perimeter fence. These discoveries were made in a block where inmates preparing to transfer to open prisons were not locked in their cells at night. In one of the most disturbing episodes of the undercover investigation, footage shows a prison officer having convulsions on the floor after accidentally inhaling spice, a cheap and stronger synthetic alternative to cannabis, which is rife in the jail.What is going wrong with the prison system?Put prisoner safety first, charities sayPrison suicides rise to record levelThe undercover reporter, who was working as a custody officer, was told by some staff they did not feel able to confront prisoners because they were worried back-up support would take too long to arrive. During the secret filming, the reporter also recorded scenes including: The Panorama investigation comes days after the Ministry of Justice announced the replacement of the National Offender Management Service with a new prison and probation service aimed at cutting crime and reforming offenders. HMP Northumberland is run by Sodexo Justice Services. It was privatised in 2014, when the government was aiming to cut £500m from the prisons budget.  To win the contract, Sodexo pledged to save the taxpayer £130m over 15 years. Two hundred jobs, including 96 prison officer posts, were cut.At the time of the deal, the Prison Officers Association warned it could result in ""escapes and riots"". Read Prison Undercover: Reporter Joe Fenton's story:It didn't take too long to realise the inmates were, in effect, running this prisonHMP Northumberland is a training prison that is meant to offer a range of education and training programmes to prepare inmates for release. The Panorama reporter witnessed some inmates colouring in pictures of the children's cartoon character Peppa Pig in an ""employability skills"" class provided by an outside contractor, Novus.It told Panorama it had investigated these concerns and sent a report to the government.The president of the Prison Governors Association, Andrea Albutt, told the BBC previous staff cuts were behind the loss of control. She said: ""The situation is that there are so few prison officers at the moment - that their confidence has been affected and we have a more violent prison population.""Good quality staff-prisoner relationships, which yielded intelligence, had been hit by the lack of staff, she said.The Ministry of Justice told the BBC: ""The justice secretary has been clear that levels of violence and self harm in our prisons are too high, which is why we are investing an extra £100m annually to boost the front line by 2,500 officers.""These are longstanding issues which will not be resolved in weeks or months but we are determined to make our prisons places of safety and reform.""A spokesman for Sodexo said: ""We are proud of those staff at HMP Northumberland who do a professional job in such difficult circumstances. ""Security and the safety of our prisoners and staff are our top priority, which is why we have made significant investments in these two areas over and above the contract requirements.""As part of the investigation, Panorama analysed what prisoners had been saying about safety in prisons across England and Wales. Panorama took HM Inspectorate of Prisons data on prisoners' perceptions and analysed it to reveal how fears have changed over the last decade. The calculations are a snapshot of what inmates said was happening at the time of the inspection. Not every jail is inspected every year and conditions can change rapidly if a new regime or resources are introduced.Sir Martin Narey, former head of the Prison Service and now a non-executive member of the Ministry of Justice's board, said: ""The plain truth is that there are too few prison officers.""If that reduction in number leads to a lack of confidence, then the great danger is some officers have retreated from interaction with prisoners to the ends of wings.""That's very dangerous for the sort of prison service that we want.""Sir Martin believes that Justice Secretary Elizabeth Truss's pledge to recruit more officers would make a difference. ""We need to concentrate on recovering their confidence,"" he said.""The disorder we've seen more recently reflects prisoner anger about reductions in regime.""""If you take people and lock them up and don't use that period to try to do something, then we're just losing a golden opportunity.""This was echoed by the Conservative MP and former prisons minister Crispin Blunt,  who said: ""We have got to get to a place where prison is used as a place to turn people around.""

Inflation is also predicted to rise this year in the eurozone, reaching an annual rate of 1.%, up from just 0.2% in 2016.The view of the Commission on the UK was shared recently by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR).Earlier this month it also predicted an economic slowdown in the UK, with the country growing by 1.7% this year and 1.9% in 2018."

The Association for Licensed Multiple Retailers (ALMR) has written to Philip Hammond asking for more transitional relief for the sector. Business rates in England and Wales are being updated to take into account changes in property values. However, the government says a cap on how much bills can rise will cushion the impact for firms facing increases. The letter written by the ALMR on behalf of its members says that ""on average, the pub sector will see a 15% increase and restaurants a 23% increase across the country"".""This will add a further £300m to £500m in additional cost in the hospitality sector,"" it says.The ALMR says the impact of the extra costs could threaten the positive contribution the sector is making to overall economic growth in the UK. The ALMR represents leading brands, including Pizza Express, Wagamama and Yo Sushi, as well as smaller businesses operating from only one or two premises. ""We would urge you to consider reviewing the transitional relief provisions and the introduction of sector specific hospitality retail relief,"" the letter says. Rates are calculated by multiplying the rateable value of a property by a multiplier set by the government. But as property values change over time, rateable values need to be reassessed periodically - usually every five years.However this update to property values is two years behind schedule, making it a harder pill to swallow in areas where the price of real estate has been rising. A statement from the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) said that most businesses will not face sharp rises in costs.""Following the revaluation, three-quarters of properties will see no change or even a fall in their bills, and the small minority of businesses that face an increase will benefit from our £3.6bn transitional relief scheme,"" it said.However, property experts have predicted that some businesses, especially in thriving commercial centres and the south-east of England could see very dramatic changes to their rates bills, by as much as several hundred percent.Many pubs and restaurants occupy prime real estate in town and city centres. The DCLG added that many pubs had seen turnover increase significantly since the last rates valuation in 2010 as a result of the growth in casual dining. That increase in revenue would affect the rateable value of the property, it said.However the government's planned cap on annual increases means that bills will rise gradually over five years rather than all in one go, with greater protection provided for smaller businesses.The DCLG said that while some businesses will see their rates bill rise, others will see bills remain the same or even fall.Overall the rates upgrade is designed to be revenue neutral."

Mr Watson said the party had ""got the leadership settled for this Parliament"".   The most recent ICM opinion poll put Labour on 27%, 15 points behind the Conservatives. And a YouGov poll suggested that 62% of voters were unfavourable towards Mr Corbyn, compared with 22% who were favourable. The Sunday Times is reporting that Labour is involved in ""succession planning"", and research carried out on its behalf suggests Mr Corbyn is the ""most unpopular"" choice.Labour's elections co-ordinator, Ian Lavery told the BBC: ""There's plenty of leaders to pick from if and when Jeremy decides, of his own volition, that it's not for him at the election. That isn't the case at this point in time.""Asked if Labour was looking at potential replacements for Mr Corbyn in carrying out its research, Mr Lavery said: ""I'm absolutely sure that that hasn't been the case and isn't the case. Speaking on BBC Radio 5 live's Pienaar's Politics, he added: ""I think that's pure political poppycock. To suggest that the Labour party have been like polling with these groupings to identify popularity between potential candidates for the leadership is nonsense.""And Mr Watson told the Andrew Marr Show: ""I only saw this story last night. People tell me that isn't the case, it wasn't road-testing leadership candidates. ""There was a range of shadow cabinet members that were so-called road-tested, this is what we do in our normal run of political consultations.""I'm just slightly relieved they weren't road testing me on the document that was leaked to the newspaper."" The churn in Corbyn's shadow cabinetMr Corbyn saw off a challenge from Owen Smith last year, winning 61.8% of the vote - a higher share than in the first contest.Mr Watson said: ""This is not the time for a leadership election. He got a second mandate from our members last year. He is now the established leader of the Labour Party.""It is his duty to lead the official Opposition through a period of unprecedented economic uncertainty and he will be tested. He has to explain those and he has to improve on them and he's well aware of that.""Last week, Mr Corbyn imposed a three-line whip - the strongest possible sanction - on his MPs to support the government's Brexit bill, arguing that this reflected the will of the people, as expressed in last year's EU referendum.Shadow business secretary Clive Lewis resigned from the front bench, saying that to back the bill would go against his conscience. Altogether, 52 Labour MPs voted against Mr Corbyn's orders.Mr Watson called the timing of Mr Lewis's resignation not ""particularly helpful"", but welcomed his denial of rumours he was mounting a bid to topple Mr Corbyn.He said: ""We've had a tough 18 months. We had a damaging second leadership election, so we've got an uphill struggle ahead. ""The polls aren't great for us, but I'm determined that we've got the leadership settled for this Parliament, that we can focus on developing a very positive, clear message to the British people in a general election.""He added: ""We need to make sure we address the concerns of the British people in a manifesto and that we communicate our message far more clearly than we have been doing. But there's nothing to say that Labour can't win a general election.""Mr Watson said Labour had to convince voters the party wanted ""this country to be great again, that if you live and work hard in this country you can eventually own your own home or rent a home at an affordable price, have a job that is satisfying and then have a dignified retirement.""Political parties that don't address those issues are political parties that don't have a future.""He described Labour as ""a patriotic party"", saying: ""We're very proud of our country and very proud of singing the national anthem.""ICM interviewed 1,984 adults from 3 to 5 February. For its poll, YouGov interviewed 1,670 adults on 2 and 3 February."

2017-02-13,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20170214031941/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThis article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide to the UK's vote to leave the European Union. It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 52% to 48%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who resigned on the day after losing the referendum. Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she says she will respect the will of the people. She has said ""Brexit means Brexit"" but there is still a lot of debate about what that will mean in practice especially on the two key issues of how British firms do business in the European Union and what curbs are brought in on the rights of European Union nationals to live and work in the UK. She set out more details of her negotiating hopes in her key speech on Brexit.The UK economy appears to have weathered the initial shock of the Brexit vote, although the value of the pound remains near a 30-year low, but opinion is sharply divided over the long-term effects of leaving the EU. Some major firms such as Easyjet and John Lewis have pointed out that the slump in sterling has increased their costs. Britain also lost its top AAA credit rating, meaning the cost of government borrowing will be higher. But share prices have recovered from a dramatic slump in value, with both the FTSE 100 and the broader FTSE 250 index, which includes more British-based businesses, trading higher than before the referendum. The Bank of England cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - a record low and the first cut since 2009 - after the vote and there has not been the economic slump or recession that some had predicted. The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it has to invoke an agreement called Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May has said she intends to trigger this process by the end of March 2017, meaning the UK will be expected to have left by the summer of 2019, depending on the precise timetable agreed during the negotiations. The government will also enact a Great Repeal Bill which will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. It is expected to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove.After a court battle, the UK's Supreme Court ruled in January that Parliament must be consulted before Article 50 is invoked. This is why a two line Brexit bill is currently making its way through Parliament. MPs have approved it after Labour MPs were told to support it. It is now heading to the House of Lords to be debated and voted on.Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These men - dubbed the Three Brexiteers - will play a central role in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although it will be Mrs May, as prime minister, who will have the final say. David Cameron's government did not do any emergency planning for Brexit ahead of the referendum and Mrs May has rejected calls to say what her negotiating goals are.Once Article 50 has been triggered, the UK will have two years to negotiate its withdrawal. But no one really knows how the Brexit process will work - Article 50 was only created in late 2009 and it has never been used. Former Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, now Chancellor, wanted Britain to remain in the EU, and he has suggested it could take up to six years for the UK to complete exit negotiations. The terms of Britain's exit will have to be agreed by 27 national parliaments, a process which could take some years, he has argued. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. The UK will continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making.Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Following Theresa May's Brexit recent speech we now know that the UK is not intending to stay in the EU's single market. Although there has been speculation for months about the issue, it would have meant the UK staying under the auspices of the European Court of Justice and having to allow unlimited EU immigration, under freedom of movement rules.Both sides want trade to continue after Brexit with the UK seeking a positive outcome for those who wish to trade goods and services"" - such as those in the City of London and wanting a ""comprehensive free trade deal"" giving the UK ""the greatest possible access"" to the single market. Mrs May says she wants the UK to reach a new customs union deal with the EU. A customs union is where countries agree not to impose tariffs on each others' goods and have a common tariff on goods coming in from elsewhere. The UK is currently part of the EU customs union but that stops the UK being able to do its own trade deals with other countries. Reality Check: How could customs union work?These terms have increasingly been used as debate focused on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people in order to maintain access to the EU single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result.The government has declined to give a firm guarantee about the status of EU nationals currently living in the UK, saying this is not possible without a reciprocal pledge from other EU members about the millions of British nationals living on the continent. EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, will be be able to stay, the chief civil servant at the Home Office has said. The rights of other EU nationals would be subject to negotiations on Brexit and the ""will of Parliament"", he added.A lot depends on the kind of deal the UK agrees with the EU. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions on EU nationals, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.Again, it depends on whether the UK government decides to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages. Citizens' Advice has reminded people their rights have not changed yet and asked anyone to contact them if they think they have been discriminated against following the Leave vote.Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested EU migrants who come to the UK as Brexit nears may not be given the right to stay. He has said there might have to be a cut-off point if there was a ""surge"" in new arrivals.People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote. The day-to-day spending impact is likely to be more significant. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it to remain at least 10% below where it was on 23 June, in the long term. This means imported goods will consequently get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have already been seen and the issue was most notably illustrated by the dispute between Tesco and Marmite's makers about whether prices would be put up or not in the stores.The latest UK inflation figures, for January, showed the CPI inflation rate rising to 1.8%, its highest level for two and a half years, with signs of more cost pressures set to feed through in the months to come.Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration.She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations. As mentioned above, the key issue is whether other EU nations will grant the UK access to the single market, if that is what it wants, while at the same time being allowed to restrict the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK.Mrs May has said she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. It is currently running at 330,000 a year, of which 184,000 are EU citizens, and 188,000 are from outside the EU - the figures include a 39,000 outflow of UK citizens.It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Liberal Democrats - who have just a handful of MPs - have vowed to halt Brexit and keep Britain in the EU if they were to win the next general election.Some commentators, including former House of Commons clerk Lord Lisvane, have argued that a further referendum would be needed to ratify whatever deal the UK hammers out with the EU, but there are few signs political leaders view this as a viable option.Yes. Theresa May has appeared keen to avoid a vote on her negotiating stance, to avoid having to give away her priorities, but Theresa May has said there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. It is worth mentioning that any deal also has to be agreed by the European Parliament - with British MEPs getting a chance to vote on it there.  While there could be limitations on British nationals' ability to live and work in EU countries, it seems unlikely they would want to deter tourists. There are many countries outside the European Economic Area, which includes the 28 EU nations plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway, that British citizens can visit for up to 90 days without needing a visa and it is possible that such arrangements could be negotiated with European countries.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. In theory, the government could, if it wanted, decide to change the colour, which is currently standardised for EU countries, says the BBC's Europe correspondent, Chris Morris.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketNo nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it is ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faces being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. A second independence referendum for the country is now ""highly likely"", she has said, although not in 2017. She has said she wants Scotland to stay in the single market and said Mrs May's decision to rule out the UK staying in the single market ""undoubtedly"" brings the referendum closer.Before his resignation Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said the impact in Northern Ireland would be ""very profound"" and that the whole island of Ireland should now be able to vote on reunification. But, speaking while she was still Northern Ireland Secretary, Theresa Villiers ruled out the call from Sinn Féin for a border poll, saying the circumstances in which one would be called did not exist. The land border is likely to be a key part of the Brexit talks. Theresa May said a priority for her would be negotiating a deal with the EU which allowed a common travel area between the UK and the Republic of Ireland.During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest. But his successor Theresa May has said she will keep it in place, at least for the current Parliament, which is due to last until 2020.So far there has been a cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. There are yet to be signs that rising inflation have worried the Bank of England  enough to consider raising interest rates.  But if that happened it would make mortgages and loans more expensive to repay - but would be good news for savers.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.Eurotunnel boss Jacques Gounon said last November the reintroduction of duty-free would be ""an incredible boost for my business"" but he later said  that remark had been ""light-hearted"". Erik Juul-Mortensen, president of the Tax Free World Association (TFWA) said after the referendum vote ""it is not possible to predict how Brexit will affect the duty free and travel retail industry, and it is wiser not to make assumptions about exactly what the impact will be.""  They are at the moment but no-one knows the longer term prospects for definite. The EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - is not an EU initiative. It was negotiated between countries within a group known as the European Economic Area, often simply referred to as the single market (plus Switzerland, which confusingly is not a member of the EEA, but has agreed access to the single market). Therefore, the future of Britons' EHIC cover could depend on whether the UK decided to sever ties with the EEA.Probably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report. In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two-thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.However, the UK government is committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, the UK government is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR. However, the EU has its own European Court of Justice, whose decisions are binding on EU institutions and member states.Its rulings have sometimes caused controversy in Britain and supporters of a Brexit have called for immediate legislation to curb its powers. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also cited sovereignty and democracy, and they wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Four of the biggest US banks have committed to helping maintain the City's position. But HSBC will move up to 1,000 jobs to Paris, the BBC understands. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Pest control firm Rentokil Initial says it could make £15m extra this year thanks to a weaker currency.Others are less optimistic. Hilary Jones, a director at UK cosmetics firm Lush said the company was ""terrified"" about the economic impact. She added that while the firm's Dorset factory would continue to produce goods for the UK market, products for the European market may be made at its new plant in Germany.Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After the Leave vote, the government will probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""As with most elements of the UK economy, not enough solid data has been published yet to accurately conclude the Brexit effect on house prices. Industry figures have pointed to ""uncertainty"" among buyers and sellers that could potentially change the housing market.So far, the most significant research has come from the respected Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which has published the conclusions of a survey of its members. This primarily records sentiment among surveyors.It found that house prices are expected to fall across the UK in the three months after the referendum vote. However, the dip in prices is only expected to persist over the 12 months from June in London and East Anglia, surveyors predict.House prices were already slowing in central London, owing to the fall-out from changes to stamp duty rules in April.Separate figures from property portal Rightmove suggested the average asking price of houses coming on to the market in England and Wales fell by 0.9%, or £2,647, in July compared with June. It said that agents had reported very few sales had fallen through as a result of the vote.Many potential first-time buyers would welcome a fall in house prices, with ownership among the young falling owing to affordability concerns. Investors in property, or those who have paid off a mortgage and hope to leave homes as inheritance would be unhappy with a long-term reduction in value.  Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law following the decision to leave the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" will not necessarily disappear overnight - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU means the UK will not be part of TTIP. It will have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Former Labour health secretary Lord Owen has said that because of TTIP (see answer above) the only way to protect the NHS from further privatisation was to get out of the EU."

Before housing costs are taken into account, working-age households still have higher incomes than pensioner households.News that pensioner households are now better off than working-age families was widely reported on Monday.There have been reports for some time that incomes for pensioners have been growing faster than those for working-age people, largely as a result of pensions being protected by the triple-lock, while many working-age benefits have been frozen.The triple-lock guarantees that pensions rise by the same as average earnings, the consumer price index, or 2.5%, whichever is the highest.But the report from the Resolution Foundation was the first suggestion that the retired had actually overtaken the working-age group.The figures referred to the ""typical pensioner household"", by which it meant the median, which is the household for which half of pensioner households have higher income and half of them have lower incomes.In this case, a pensioner household is one in which at least one member is of pension age or older (65 for men, 64 for women) whether or not that person is working. There can also be working people in a pensioner household.But the important factor that has been mentioned little in the coverage is that the measure of income that the Resolution Foundation is using is one for income after housing costs have been paid. Taking income after housing costs makes a huge difference because pensioner households are more likely to own their own homes and to have relatively small or paid-off mortgages.The report says, for example, that 70% of the silent generation (born 1926-45) own their homes outright, while just over 40% of the baby boomers (1946-65) own theirs, with another 30% still having mortgages to pay.    The median income for both working-age and pensioner households is just over £20,000 a year, so housing costs would make a big difference.Also, the figures do not take account of people in care homes, which would be expected to increase housing costs for those of pension age.The Resolution Foundation confirms in the report that before housing costs are paid, the median working-age household still has a higher income than the median pensioner household.

2017-02-13,More than poppycock?,https://web.archive.org//web/20170214031941/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38950597,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkCould Jeremy Corbyn be replaced as Labour leader? And if so when? Those whispered questions have been echoing between Labour MPs and party apparatchiks at Westminster for weeks, for months. But today the guessing game has risen to a new pitch.In BBC interviews, we have been given answers of a sort by two of the most prominent members of the shadow cabinet.Yes, the Labour leader could be replaced. And the change could take place at the next election, ""if and when"" Mr Corbyn decides he has had enough.This time, the helpful guidance was not contained in any unattributed, anonymous briefing from a ""senior MP"" or ""party source"", who may or may not be keen to hasten Mr Corbyn on his way. They were the words of the party's newly appointed election co-ordinator in the shadow cabinet, Ian Lavery.In an interview with me for BBC Radio 5 live's Pienaar's Politics, I asked Mr Lavery if a report in the Sunday Times newspaper was true - that the party had conducted focus group research to gauge the potential appeal of two shadow cabinet colleagues, Rebecca Long-Bailey and Angela Raynor, as potential future leadership candidates.His denial was as emphatic as it was unsurprising. It was, he said, ""political poppycock.""""I think they are fantastic candidates. We have got lots of quality in the Labour Party and it's not just the two who have been mentioned,"" he added.More interesting was what he said next. ""There's plenty of leaders to pick from, if and when Jeremy decides, of his own volition, that it's not for him at the election."" He concluded, again helpfully: ""That isn't the case at this point in time.""So, in the space of one brief moment, the man now appointed to guide Labour through what could become a torrid series of electoral tests has volunteered that, in his judgement, Mr Corbyn may conceivably decide to pass on the leadership ""at the election"". And that there had been no such decision on Mr Corbyn's part ""at this point in time"". All of which can only crank up the volume of whispered speculation.Against this background, the verdict of Tom Watson, Labour's deputy Labour leader, in his interview with Andrew Marr, perhaps becomes a little more intriguing. He told Marr the party ""has got the leadership settled for this Parliament"".As for the mood in the party, much depends on the coming Parliamentary by-elections in the once supposedly ""safe"" constituencies of Stoke-on-Trent Central and Copeland in Cumbria.The new election co-ordinator, who replaced Jon Trickett amid a certain unease at the state of Labour's readiness for the fights ahead, was upbeat. Upbeat, at least up to a point. ""If you look at them separately, they are both relatively positive at this moment in time, despite what he polls might say, despite what individuals might say,"" he said. It was not the most ringingly confident assessment I can remember from an election strategist.If Labour loses one or both of these seats, expect the present simmering unease in the party to approach boiling point once again."

I don't think so. The coverage of one MP's Early Day Motion (EDM) of no confidence in the Speaker, in the wake of his comments about President Trump, is massively over-egged. First, it's an EDM. They are a form of parliamentary graffiti - a way of expressing an opinion, and nestling amongst the 946 EDMs on such subjects as the Queen's sapphire jubilee, diplomatic relations with Armenia, the Battle of Cable St and organised dog fighting, it has so far attracted a single signature - although that might change when MPs return from their holidays. But the more important point about EDMs is that some special parliamentary acrobatics are needed for them to be debated on the floor of the Commons. The government could provide the time, but it won't. An opposition party could give up some of its allocated time, but they won't. The Backbench Business Committee, which controls its own block of Commons time, could allocate a slot - but it almost certainly won't.So no debate. But what if a large number of MPs do, eventually, sign it? Will a shamed Speaker Bercow retire to his state dining room with a bottle of his own-brand whisky and a loaded revolver? I strongly doubt it. This Speaker saw off a coup attempt on the last day of the 2010 Parliament, when the coalition whips attempted to change the rules on Speaker elections as a precursor to an attempt to unseat him after the general election. That vote was effectively a direct attack on the Speaker - and was supported by 202 MPs. Yet Speaker Bercow did not resign. Like another Marmite politician, he's a fighter, not a quitter. And no-one should make the mistake of assuming he is universally loathed by Tory MPs. The Bercow phenomenon is a complex thing. On the one hand, he's a hardline parliamentary moderniser. On a cosmetic level, he has ditched the grand gold-embroidered robes worn by his predecessors, and most recently, presided over the decision to abandon the court dress worn by the Commons Clerks. But more importantly, he has opened up the procedure of the House, with historically important results.A few months back I wrote about how his rulings provided the parliamentary openings that led to pro-Brexit MPs cornering David Cameron into conceding the EU referendum. But he has also allowed 353 Urgent Questions, putting ministers on the spot on topical issues, so that the Commons is visible on the TV news, debating the issues of the moment. In the 21st Century that is essential. MPs also appreciate his brisk conduct of question times, giving many more their moment in the Parliamentary limelight.But then there's the other side of the coin. His put-downs can be brutal, and Tory MPs believe he targets them more often than the opposition - although the Lib Dems, still smarting from the duffing up of their leader, Tim Farron, at PMQs the other week, might argue that they get swatted too. Where other Speakers might have poured on a little honey ""the Right Hon Gentleman who is a distinguished parliamentarian, should know better…"", Bercow's repartee - like his admonition to Tory Tim Loughton ""the children's minister should stop acting like a child"" - has not been forgotten or forgiven by its targets. His stand-up shouting match with the then government Chief Whip, Patrick McLoughlin, on the floor of the Commons, may be the most spectacular example of a loss of temper, but it's not the only one. To quote Kipling, the burnt Speaker's bandaged finger goes wabbling back to the fire. But there are plenty of reasons why I expect him to survive. First there is no Commons majority to remove him. Support for the Speaker may be the love that dare not speak its name in the Conservative 1922 Committee, but there is a solid phalanx of Bercow-supporting Tories out there. As one senior member of this elusive group put it, ""with this Speaker, you have to take the rough with the smooth"". They believe his failings are a price worth paying for a Speaker who they believe facilitates tough scrutiny of the government.Second, the government has learned the lesson of its attempt to remove him on 26 March 2015, and doesn't want to place its dabs on the dagger this time. And without a government whipping operation behind it, any direct attempt to topple the Speaker is doomed.Third, MPs want to protect the Office. This is a more subtle point. If the Speaker is to be dethroned, his successor will feel vulnerable from day one. They will be less willing to offend, not just ministers, but pretty much anyone. And that means the rights of individual MPs and backbench groupings like the pre-referendum Brexiteers to make life difficult, may be less diligently enforced. This argument convinces a lot of older hands who are not obvious Bercow backers on other grounds.Fourth, he's going anyway. Perhaps later in this Parliament than some may hope, but he's been in the Chair since 2009, and that's a pretty long spell. So why mount a putsch when success is not guaranteed and there's a price to be paid?So when the Bercow era does end, it will be at a time of his choosing."
2017-02-13,Peering ahead,https://web.archive.org//web/20170214031941/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38918526,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkSharpen your pencils. Now Theresa May has her prize from the Commons, getting the Article 50 bill (she never wanted) through with no major changes, it makes its way to the red and gold end of the Palace of Westminster, to the Lords.The first debate is set for 20 February. More than 140 Peers have already put their names down to speak. But at that stage there probably won't be a vote. A week later the thornier more detailed committee stage begins. Then the last certain stage, the third reading and report is scheduled for 7 March. If it all goes according to the government's plan, which sources say is ""hugely unpredictable"", it would allow Theresa May to stick to her timetable and push the button for exit talks to start the next week, once the Bill has been rubber-stamped by the other Palace. (It's daft in this business to make too many predictions, but I d put a fiver on that happening on Wednesday 15 March.)The government will have a bumpier ride in the Lords after a grumpy process in the Commons. The Lords is dramatically different because the government most certainly does not have a majority among peers. And, it is the Lords' express purpose to scrutinise and if needed, improve draft laws before sending them back along the corridor to the Commons.Overnight a government source suggested that the Lords had better jolly well let the Brexit bill go through, or else. Despite the sabre-rattling though, the atmosphere in the Lords is less febrile than that language might suggest.Downing Street this morning tried to dampen down the aggressive briefing. And one source in the Lords described the threat as ""total BS"" - I'll leave you to work that out.The main opposition leader, Baroness Smith, has made it plain on several occasions that although the Lords may try to tweak the Bill, Labour, broadly, has no intention of trying to block it. Her modus operandi is to ""hold to account, not hold to ransom"".The Liberal Democrats are more intent on making changes in the Lords, for it is there they can wield power, rather than in the Commons. But unless they have the support of Labour too, there is a limit to how much trouble they can cause.The chatter suggests the Lords will push for concessions from the government over the rights of EU citizens to stay here, reporting the progress of negotiations regularly to Parliament and maybe on a final ""meaningful vote"" for both Houses on the deal.It will be up to the government to decide whether to tweak the bill slightly as they did in the Commons or risk some defeats. Insiders predict it is likely the Lords may end up sending back the bill to the Commons once, as ""ping pong"" to force the government to make a change or two. But even senior Lib Dem sources don't expect hostile stand-offs for weeks on end. The Lords will make their voices heard, there is no question about that and the Article 50 bill could run into trouble. It would be wrong to suggest that ministers don't anticipate a tricky time. But today at least, whatever the sabre-rattling from some parts of government, this historic piece of legislation looks likely to be the subject of a few skirmishes in the Lords, rather than an apocalyptic battle.

2017-02-13,Ward-by ward,https://web.archive.org//web/20170214031941/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38762034,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe BBC has obtained a more localised breakdown of votes from nearly half of the local authorities which counted EU referendum ballots last June.This information provides much greater depth and detail in explaining the pattern of how the UK voted. The key findings are:A statistical analysis of the data obtained for over a thousand individual local government wards confirms how the strength of the local Leave vote was strongly associated with lower educational qualifications.Wards where the population had fewer qualifications tended to have a higher Leave vote, as shown in the chart. If the proportion of the local electorate with a degree or similar qualification was one percentage point lower, then on average the leave vote was higher by nearly one percentage point.Using ward-level data means we can compare voting figures in this way to the local demographic information collected in the 2011 census. Of the main census statistics, this is the one with the greatest association with how people voted. In statistical terms the level of educational qualifications explains about two-thirds of the variation in the results between different wards. The correlation is strong, whether based on assessing graduate and equivalent qualifications or lower-level ones. This ward-by-ward analysis covers 1,070 individual wards in England and Wales whose boundaries had not changed since the 2011 census, about one in nine of the UK's wards. We had very little ward-level data from Scotland, and none from Northern Ireland.It should be noted, however, that many ward counts also included some postal votes from across the counting area, and therefore some variation between wards will have been masked by the random allocation of postal votes for counting. This makes the results less accurate geographically, but we can still use the information to explore broad national and local patterns.  Adding age as a second factor significantly helps to further explain voting patterns. Older populations were more likely to vote Leave. Education and age combined account for nearly 80% of the voting variation between wards. Ethnicity is a smaller factor, but one which also contributed to the results. Adding that in means that now 83% of the variation in the vote between wards is explained. White populations were generally more pro-Leave, and ethnic minorities less so.  However, there were some interesting differences between London and elsewhere.The ethnic dimension is particularly interesting when examining the outliers on the graph that compares the Leave vote to levels of education.There are numerous wards towards the bottom left of the graph where electorates with lower educational qualifications nevertheless produced low Leave and high Remain votes. This is where the link between low qualifications and Leave voting breaks down. It turns out that these exceptional wards have high ethnic minority populations, particularly in Birmingham and Haringey in north London. In contrast, there are virtually no dramatic outliers on the other side of the line, where comparatively highly educated populations voted Leave. Only one point on the graph stands out - this is Osterley and Spring Grove in Hounslow, west London, a mainly ethnic minority ward which had a Leave vote of 63%. While this figure does include some postal votes, they are not nearly enough to explain away this unusual outcome.In fact, in Ealing and Hounslow, west London boroughs with many voters of Asian origin, the ethnic correlation was in the other direction to the national picture: a higher number of Asian voters was associated with a higher Leave vote.This powerful link to educational attainment could stem from the lower qualified tending to feel less confident about their prospects and ability to compete for work in a competitive globalised economy with high levels of migration. On the other hand some commentators see it as primarily reflecting a ""culture war"" or ""values conflict"", rather than issues of economics and inequality. Research shows that non-graduates tend to take less liberal positions than graduates on a range of social issues from immigration and multi-culturalism to the death penalty.   The former campaign director of Vote Leave, Dominic Cummings, argues that the better educated are more prone to holding irrational political opinions because they are more driven by fashion and a group mentality. Of course this assessment does not imply that Leave voters were almost all poorly educated and old, and Remain voters well educated and young. The Leave side obviously attracted support from many middle class professionals, graduates and younger people. Otherwise it couldn't have won. While there was undoubtedly a lot of voting which cut across these criteria, the point of this analysis is to explore how different social groups most probably voted - and it is clear that education, age and ethnicity were crucial influences.  After these three key factors are taken into account, adding in further demographic measures from the census does little to increase the explanation of UK-wide voting patterns. However, this does not reflect the distinctively more pro-Remain voting in Scotland, since we are short of Scottish data at this geographical level. It is clear as well that in a few specific locations high student numbers were also very relevant. To a certain extent, using the level of educational qualifications as a measure combines both class and age factors, with working class and older adults both tending to be less well qualified.But the association between education and the voting results is stronger than the association between social or occupational class and the results. This is still true after taking the age of the local population into account.This suggests that voters with lower qualifications were more likely to back Leave than the better qualified, even when they were in the same social or occupational class.The existence of a significant connection between Leave voting and lower educational qualifications had already been suggested by analysis of the published referendum results from the official counting areas.The data we have obtained strengthens this conclusion, because voting patterns can now be compared to social statistics from the 2011 census at a much more detailed geographical level than by the earlier studies. The BBC analysis is also consistent with opinion polling (for example, from Lord Ashcroft, Ipsos Mori and YouGov) that tried to identify the characteristics of Leave and Remain voters.  The data we have collected can be used to illustrate the sort of places where the Leave and Remain camps did particularly well: it is hard to imagine a more glaring social contrast than that between the deprived, poorly educated housing estates of Brambles and Thorntree in Middlesbrough, and the privileged elite colleges of Market ward in central Cambridge. It is important to bear in mind, however, that most of the voting figures mentioned below also include some postal votes, so they should be treated as approximate rather than precise.  It is also important to note that the examples are limited to the places for which we were able to obtain localised information, which was only a minority of areas. The rest of the country may well contain even starker instances.Of the 1,283 individual wards for which we have data, the highest Leave vote was 82.5% in Brambles and Thorntree, a section of east Middlesbrough with many social problems. Ward boundaries have changed since the 2011 census, but in that survey the Thorntree part of the area had the lowest proportion of people with a degree or similar qualification of anywhere in England and Wales, at only 5%. And according to Middlesbrough council, the figure for the current Brambles and Thorntree ward is even lower, at just 4%. Second highest was 80.3% in Waterlees Village, a poor locality within Wisbech, Cambridgeshire. This area has seen a major influx of East European migrants who have been doing low-paid work in nearby food processing factories and farms, with tensions between them and British residents. Other wards with available data which had the strongest Leave votes were congregated in Middlesbrough, Canvey Island in Essex, Skegness in coastal Lincolnshire, and Havering in east London.The highest Remain vote was 87.8% in Market ward in central Cambridge, an area with numerous colleges and a high student population, in a city which was strongly pro-Remain.This was followed by Ashley ward  (85.6%) in central Bristol, a district featuring ethnic diversity, gentrification and alternative culture.Next highest was Northumberland Park (85.0%) in Haringey, north London, which has a substantial black population. Other wards with available data which had the strongest Remain votes were generally located in Cambridge, Bristol and the multi-ethnic London boroughs of Haringey and Lambeth. The count for Ashburton in Croydon, south London, split 50-50 exactly, with both Leave and Remain getting 3,885 votes, but that did include some postal ballots.As for being nearest to the overall result, the combined count of Tulketh and University, neighbouring wards near the centre of Preston, was 51.92% for leave, very close to the UK wide figure of 51.89%. The individual ward of Barnwood in Gloucester had Leave at 51.94%. Both figures however contain some postal votes.Given that a few councils provided even more detailed data down to the level of polling districts, it is possible to identify some very small localities that were nicely representative of the national picture. The 527 voters in the neighbouring districts of Kirk Langley and Mackworth in Amber Valley in Derbyshire, whose two ballot boxes were counted together, produced a leave proportion of 51.99%. And this figure is not contaminated by any postal votes.So journalists (or anyone else for that matter) who seek a microcosm of the UK should perhaps visit the Mundy Arms pub in Mackworth, the location for that district's polling station.Similarly, the 427 voters in the combined neighbouring polling districts of Chiddingstone Hoath and Hever Four Elms to the south of Sevenoaks in Kent delivered a leave vote of 51.6% (again, without any postal votes).The data obtained points to 269 areas of various sizes (wards, clusters of wards or constituencies) which had a different Leave/Remain outcome compared to the official counting area of which they were part.This consists of 150 areas which backed Remain but were part of Leave-voting counting areas; and 119 in the other direction. The detailed information therefore gives us an understanding of how the electorate voted which is more variegated than the officially published results.Every one of Scotland's 32 counting areas came down on the Remain side. Yet, despite the fact that most Scottish councils did not give us much detailed information, we can nevertheless identify a few smaller parts of the country which actually backed Leave.A cluster of six wards in the Banff and Buchan area in north Aberdeenshire had a strong Leave majority of 61%. There is much local discontent within the fishing industry of this coastal district about the EU's common fisheries policy.An Taobh Siar agus Nis, a ward at the northern end of the Isle of Lewis in Na h-Eileanan an Iar (Western Isles), also voted Leave, if very narrowly. And at a smaller geographical level, in Shetland the 567 voters in the combined polling districts of Whalsay and South Unst had an extremely high Leave vote of 81%. The island of Whalsay is a fishing community, where EU rules have been controversial and in 2012 numerous skippers were heavily fined for major breaches of fishing quotas.Ealing and Hounslow are neighbouring multi-ethnic boroughs in the west of London with large Asian populations, where - in contrast to the national picture - non-white ethnicity was associated with voting Leave, particularly in Ealing. Both boroughs shared a varied internal pattern of prosperous largely white areas voting strongly Remain, poorer largely white areas preferring Leave, and the Asian areas tending to be more evenly split.Ealing voted 60% Remain, with Southfield ward hitting 76%, but in contrast the Southall wards which are over 90% ethnic minority were close to 50-50.In Hounslow the richer wards in Chiswick in the east of the area voted heavily Remain (73%), but the poorer largely white wards at the opposite western end in Feltham and Bedfont voted Leave (64-66%). Osterley and Spring Grove was also 63% Leave, the highest Leave vote in any individual ward in the UK with a non-white majority for which we have data. The south London borough of Bromley narrowly voted Remain. Those parts which did not do so by a significant margin were the Cray Valley wards, largely poor white working class areas; and Biggin Hill and Darwin wards, locations to the south which contain more open countryside and lie outside the built-up commuter belt. In Croydon in south London, places which voted Leave by substantial amounts were New Addington and Fieldway, neighbouring wards with large council estates. Beyond the areas with the strongest backing for Leave and Remain, examining the detailed breakdown of votes in various places gives greater insight into the pattern of support for the two sides - as can be seen from the following examples.In several places (for example, Birmingham, Bristol, Nottingham, Portsmouth) there was a strong contrast between the Leave-voting populations of large, rundown, predominantly white, housing estates in the urban periphery, versus Remain-voting populations in inner city areas with large numbers of ethnic minorities and sometimes students.Birmingham had several wards with large Remain votes, although the city as a whole narrowly voted Leave.  These pro-Remain wards tended to be the more highly educated, better off localities, or minority ethnic areas which strongly backed Remain despite low levels of educational qualifications. I have written about this before. In Blackburn with Darwen, Bastwell ward had the highest Remain vote at 65%, compared to only 44% in the area as a whole. This ward has an ethnic minority proportion of over 90%. Other Blackburn wards which voted Remain were also ones with high minority populations.Bradford voted to Leave (54%), but the area included some starkly contrasting places which went over 60% Remain: the prosperous, genteel, spa town of Ilkley, and strongly ethnic minority wards in the city, such as Manningham and Toller.Bristol voted strongly Remain on the whole (62%), but there were some striking exceptions, particularly the large, deprived, mainly white estates to the south of the city. Hartcliffe and Withywood backed Leave at 67%. Similar neighbouring wards (Hengrove and Whitchurch Park, Filwood, Bishopsworth and Stockwood) also voted Leave, as did the more industrial area of Avonmouth and Lawrence Weston to the north west of the city.As a county Cornwall voted to Leave. But one of its six parliamentary constituencies, Truro and Falmouth, voted 53% to Remain, possibly linked to a significant student population.In Lincoln, which voted 57% to Leave, Carholme ward stands out as very different - it voted 63% to Remain. This ward includes Lincoln University, and 43% of the residents are students Middlesbrough voted 65% to Leave. As already noted, it had several wards with extremely high leave votes of over 75%. But one ward, Linthorpe, voted very narrowly to Remain - a comparatively well-to-do inner suburb which includes an art college; and another ward, Central, which contains Teesside University, nearly did. Mole Valley in Surrey exhibited a dramatic contrast between two neighbouring districts with very different demographics and housing. The highest Remain vote was in the very prosperous location of Dorking South, which voted 63% Remain, but the neighbouring ward of Holmwoods, dominated by large estates on the edge of the town of Dorking, voted 57% Leave, the area's highest Leave vote. Nottingham voted narrowly to Leave, but the inner city ward of Radford and Park voted 68% Remain. This has both a comparatively high proportion of ethnic minorities and considerable numbers of students from two nearby universities. There was a lot of variation within the area. Bulwell - a market town to the north of the city with many social problems - voted 69% Leave  There was also a high Leave vote in the housing estate locations of the Clifton wards in the south of Nottingham.Oldham voted to Leave at 61%, but Werneth, the city ward with the highest ethnic minority population, voted Remain (57%). Other wards with high minority populations also voted Remain.In Oxford the cluster of polling districts which included Blackbird Leys and other deprived estates on the southern edge of the city voted to Leave at 51%. In contrast the central areas containing colleges, university buildings and student accommodation voted to Remain at over 80%.Plymouth voted 60% Leave, but Drake ward which includes the university had the city's highest Remain vote at 56%. Portsmouth was another place with wide variation. Paulsgrove ward, with its large estate on the edge of the city, had the highest Leave vote at 70%, whereas at the other end of the spectrum Central Southsea, an inner city ward and student area, voted 57% Remain.Rochdale voted 60% Leave. The place which bucked this trend by voting 59% Remain, Milkstone and Deeplish, was the most predominantly ethnic minority ward. Central Rochdale had the second highest Remain vote and is the other ward that is mainly not white. Walsall voted strongly Leave (68%). The only ward which voted Remain, Paddock, is both a comparatively prosperous and multi-ethnic locality.A few councils released their data at remarkably localised levels, down even to individual polling districts (ie ballot boxes) in the case of Blackburn with Darwen and Bracknell Forest, or clusters of two/three/four districts, in the case of Amber Valley, Brentwood, Sevenoaks, Shetland, South Oxfordshire, and Tewkesbury.This provides very local and specific data, in some cases just for neighbourhoods of hundreds of voters.At its most detailed this reveals that the 110 people who cast their votes in the ballot box at St. Alban's Primary School in central Blackburn split 56-52 in favour of Remain, with two spoilt papers.It also discloses stark contrasts in some neighbouring locations. The 953 people who voted at Little Harwood community centre in north Blackburn had a Leave vote of only 31%, while the 336 electors who voted in the neighbouring ballot box at Roe Lee Park primary school produced a Leave percentage over twice as high, at 64%.The very detailed data we obtained also provides some rare evidence on the views of postal compared to non-postal voters. Campaign strategists have often deliberated on whether the two groups vote differently and should be given separate targeted messages.Most places mixed boxes of postal and non-postal votes for counting, so generally it's not possible to draw comparative conclusions. However there were a few exceptions which recorded them separately, or included a very small number of non-postal votes with the postals.These figures indicate that postal voters were narrowly less likely to back Leave than voters in polling stations. Data covering five counting areas with about 260,000 votes shows that in these places the roughly one in five electors who voted by post backed Leave at 55.4%, one percentage point lower than the local non-postal support for Leave of 56.4%.The counting areas involved are Amber Valley, East Cambridgeshire, Gwynedd, Hyndburn and North Warwickshire.Since the referendum the BBC has been trying to get the most detailed, localised voting data we could from each of the counting areas.  This was a major data collection exercise carried out by my colleague George Greenwood. We managed to obtain voting figures broken down into smaller geographical units for 178 of the 399 referendum counting areas (380 councils in England, Wales and Scotland, with a separate tally in Gibraltar, while in Northern Ireland results were issued for the 18 constituencies). This varied between data for individual local government wards, wards grouped into clusters, and constituency level data. In a few cases the results supplied were even more localised than ward level. Overall the extra data covers a wide range of different areas and kinds of councils across the UK. Electoral returning officers are not covered by the Freedom of Information Act, so releasing the information was up to the discretion of councils. While some were very willing, in other cases it required a lot of persistence and persuasion. Some councils could not supply any detailed data because they mixed all ballot boxes prior to counting; some did possess more local figures but simply refused to disclose them to us. Others did provide data, but the combinations in which ballot boxes were mixed before counting were too complex to fit ward boundaries neatly.A few places such as Birmingham released their ward by ward data following the referendum on their own initiative, but in most cases the information had to be obtained by us requesting it directly, and sometimes repeatedly, from the authority."

The government has now specified what would count as exceptional circumstances. It is not clear whether the new rules will be more or less strict than just letting councils decide what counted as exceptional circumstances. The government has described the housing market as broken, promised more affordable homes and said it would help people to buy and rent.A big question in discussions of increasing the supply of homes is whether planning regulations will be changed to make it easier to build on green belt land.Green belts were introduced after World War Two to stop cities from sprawling and countryside being spoilt. About 13% of England is now covered.This covers scenic sites open to the public, such as the Chiltern Hills and North Downs, but it also covers a lot of land that has limited public access and may not be particularly beautiful.In the House of Commons, Communities Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""In 2015, we promised the British people that the green belt was safe in our hands and that is still the case.""So what has changed?There has been little variation in the amount of green belt land since 1997, although data is not available for every year.The Housing White Paper says the current planning regulations allow building on the green belt only ""in exceptional circumstances"" but that there is no detail given of what would amount to exceptional circumstances.The government has now specified that before allowing development on green belt land, councils would need to rule out options including: The White Paper also says that councils allowing the boundaries of green belt land to be changed would have to make up for it by improving other bits of green belt.

The veteran Gaullist already has form.When he was Commissioner for the Internal Market and Financial Services, Mr Barnier was dubbed ""the most dangerous man in Europe"" after taking on the banking sector and championing a cap on bankers' bonuses. But while he alarmed some in the City, and will probably do so again, he also won grudging respect as a tough but even-handed negotiator.He will need all those skills and more in his new role - chief Brexit negotiator at the European Commission. And having moved seamlessly between big jobs in Paris and Brussels - French foreign minister, Commissioner, MEP - he looks well prepared. ""Don't ask me to tell you what will be at the end of the road, we haven't begun to walk yet,"" he told a conference in Brussels last month. Mr Barnier will stick closely to the official EU position of ""no negotiation without notification"" - waiting for the UK to trigger Article 50 to start the formal process of withdrawal. But he's clearly eager to get going.""I am waiting to begin,"" he said. ""I will be ready tomorrow to negotiate, frankly speaking.""And he will bring with him an instinctive pro-European agenda, and a deep knowledge of the workings of the single market.His deputy as chief Brexit negotiator is a German trade expert, Sabine Weyand, adding to the impression that Mr Barnier will lead a team that means business.One of the biggest challenges he (and his boss Jean-Claude Juncker) faces, is to ensure that representatives of the big member states don't sideline him in the Brexit divorce negotiations.But Mr Barnier's long career in French politics means he could well have the ear of the Elysee Palace, especially if - as looks likely - a centre-right candidate wins the French presidency next year. The stakes are so high that there are bound to be some clashes.Mr Barnier has sparred with the UK's Minister for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, before, when the men both served as Europe ministers in the 1990s. It is another reminder that Michel Barnier is a politician first and foremost, rather than a bureaucrat. There have certainly been criticisms - a dash of vanity, a lack of attention to detail. His career has had plenty of downs as well as ups.But he will defend his European vision to the end, and the British government would do well not to underestimate him.At the height of the eurozone crisis, Mr Barnier always refused (politely) to do broadcast interviews in English.""One wrong word,"" he told me once with a smile, ""and we could move markets.""The next few years will be equally challenging."

Scotland voted 62% in favour of Remain.The conversation online was being driven overwhelmingly by pro-independence campaigners. But people who had supported ""Better Together"" during the Scottish referendum vote also spoke about the possibility of a break-away from the UK as a result of the vote over EU membership.  Perhaps the most significant was Scottish author JK Rowling who tweeted: ""Scotland will seek independence now. Cameron's legacy will be breaking up two unions. Neither needed to happen.""Many took to Twitter to express new or strengthened pro-independence feelings in the wake of the latest vote (Just as a reminder: a ""Yes"" vote in Scotland's 2014 referendum was for independence, while the winning ""No"" campaign backed staying in the UK).One old tweet from 2014's independence referendum gained new life on Friday. Put out by the cross-party Better Together campaign, it reminded Scottish voters that the EU membership of an independent Scotland would be no sure thing:Blog by Mike WendlingNext story: Nigel Farage's wild nightAs the EU referendum vote swung decisively to Leave, perhaps nobody's fortunes changed more than UKIP leader Nigel Farage.

It's me who has made this mistake, and one I feel absolutely terrible about.""The Sun reported that Ms Roughley's resignation had been turned down.Mr Nuttall was pressed about the posts on his website during an interview with Liverpool's Radio City station on Tuesday.In the first from August 2011, the Bootle-born politician urged the government to release files on the Hillsborough tragedy.He was quoted as saying: ""Without them being made public we will never get to the bottom of that appalling tragedy when 96 Liverpool fans including close personal friends of mine lost their lives.""In a second release published six months later, he was quoted as saying: ""I lost close friends at the match and understand as well as anyone how deep the scars of that tragedy go."" But during his radio interview, Mr Nuttall conceded the comments were inaccurate. ""I haven't lost anyone who was a close personal friend,"" he said. ""It was people I knew through football and things like that.""The comments were ""wrong"" and had not ""come from him"", he added. In the statement issued a few hours later, he said that while he took responsibility for everything published in his name, he was ""genuinely taken aback when this claim was brought to my attention and am both appalled and very sorry that an impression was given that was not accurate"".The politician has long said he attended the match with his father and two uncles. But a recent article in the Guardian quoted a number of people - including an unnamed former classmate and two Labour politicians - questioning why he had not spoken about his experience.He later responded to questions about whether he was at the match by speaking in more detail of the effect the occasion had on him.""As a 12-year-old boy, I travelled to Sheffield that day, as did so many others, to enjoy watching the team that I loved,"" he said.""From the upper tier of the Leppings Lane End, I watched the events of that day unfold with horror...

2017-02-14,PM 'looking forward' to welcoming Trump,https://web.archive.org//web/20170215070453/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38967075,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkTheresa May has said she looks forward to welcoming Donald Trump to the UK later this year after discussing his planned state visit on the phone.Last month's invitation, coming so soon after the US President took office, has proved highly controversial.Speaker John Bercow has said Mr Trump should not address Parliament during the trip in light of the row over his travel ban and comments about women. And 1.8 million people have signed a petition against the state visit.The petition, saying that the visit should be downgraded, will be debated by MPs next week alongside one backing the visit. The government said it recognised the ""strong views"" expressed but looked forward to welcoming the US president once details have been arranged.Mrs May spoke to the US president about the trip as part of their ""regular engagement"", Downing Street said.""They discussed a range of issues, including trade and security and also discussed the president's upcoming state visit to the UK,"" a spokesman said. ""The prime minister said she looks forward to welcoming him later this year.""The invitation was issued during Prime Minister Theresa May's talks with the US president in Washington last month. The government has rejected calls for the visit to be put on hold or scaled back in light of the controversy surrounding the first month of the Trump presidency. More than 1.8 million people signed a petition claiming the visit would cause the Queen ""embarrassment"" while a counter petition calling for the visit to go ahead attracted more than 309,000 signatures.Both petitions will be debated by the House of Commons on 20 February.The government responds to all petitions on its website if they are signed by more than 10,000 people, and a similar response has been issued in support of the one calling for the state visit to go ahead.Published on the petitions website, they say the government believes Mr Trump ""should be extended the full courtesy of a state visit"", adding: ""This invitation reflects the importance of the relationship between the United States of America and the United Kingdom.""At this stage, final dates have not yet been agreed for the state visit.""Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon rejected suggestions that the government was out of step with public opinion over the issue.""I think the government has a duty obviously to have good relations with the US, probably our closest ally and most important economic trading partner,"" he told Sam Walker on BBC Radio 5 live Daily.""It is equally important in a democracy that you accept the results of a democracy. President Trump has been elected now by the US and we work with him.""Solicitor Graham Guest, from Leeds, started the online petition that said Mr Trump should be allowed into the UK but not to make a state visit.It came amid protests at the president's executive order preventing people from seven mainly-Muslim countries from entering the US."
2017-02-14,Government rebuts defence spend claim,https://web.archive.org//web/20170215070453/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38969697,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe government has rejected a think tank's claim that it missed Nato's target of spending at least 2% of national income on defence.In a new report, the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) claimed spending had fallen to 1.98% in 2016 as a result of the British economy growing faster than the defence budget.But a Ministry of Defence spokesman said its figures were ""wrong"".It cited Nato's own estimate that the UK met the 2% target.The alliance says only the UK, US, Poland, Greece and Estonia met the target, which was set in 2006, last year.The UK has called on other countries to increase their spending, and US President Donald Trump has complained of European members failing to pay their fair share for collective defence arrangements.In its report, the IISS said only Greece and Estonia spent 2% or more, with the UK falling short by about £380m.Its researchers said there was ""no shared understanding"" of what constitutes a nation's defence expenditure, pointing out that Nato's definition includes not only defence ministry budgets but also pensions, expenditure for peacekeeping and humanitarian operations, and research and development costs.They added that ""very different results"" could be reached depending on how expenditure is converted into US dollars and that different GDP figures could also distort the figures.They also questioned the ""increasingly prominent"" role of the 2% figure, saying it ""only provides a limited representation of countries' defence capabilities and commitments"".""Ultimately, it is the output that matters,"" they added.The Ministry of Defence dismissed the think tank's assessment of the UK's spending.""These figures are wrong,"" it said. ""Nato's own figures clearly show that the UK spends over 2% of its GDP on defence.""Our defence budget is the biggest in Europe, the second largest in Nato, and it is growing each year as we invest £178bn in new equipment and the UK steps up globally, with new ships, submarines and aircraft over the next decade.""The MoD said the IISS calculation may have been affected by fluctuations in exchange rates.The think tank's report was released ahead of a meeting of Nato defence ministers in Brussels on Wednesday.At a press conference ahead of the summit, Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg  unveiled figures showing that European members and Canada had between them increased defence spending by 3.8% above inflation last year.Mr Stoltenberg said the figures were ""significantly higher than what we had originally foreseen"" and showed Nato had ""turned a corner"" after many years of steep cuts in spending.He said: ""Regardless of language, the most important thing is that we increase defence spending and that is exactly what we are doing.""MPs have previously questioned the way the UK government records its spending to meet the 2% target.In April, the cross-party defence committee said including what is spent on intelligence gathering and war pensions could be seen as ""creative accounting""."
2017-02-14,UK inflation highest since June 2014,https://web.archive.org//web/20170215070453/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-38966692,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkInflation has reached its highest rate for two-and-a-half years, mainly as a result of the rising price of fuel.Annual inflation as measured by the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) reached 1.8% last month, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said, up from a rate of 1.6% in December.It is the fourth consecutive month that the rate has risen and takes inflation to its highest since June 2014.Fuel prices hit a two-year high in early February, according to the RAC.As well as fuel, the ONS said food prices also contributed to the rise in inflation, as prices were unchanged between December and January, having fallen a year ago.Offsetting these factors, the prices of clothing and footwear fell by more than they did 12 months ago.Inflation means inflation, but who wins?The increase in the inflation rate takes it closer to the Bank of England's target rate of 2%, which was last seen in December 2013. Inflation is widely expected to pick up this year as a result of the weaker pound, which is making imported goods more expensive. Earlier this month, the Bank of England said it expected the inflation rate would hit 2.7% next year. Separate ONS figures for producer prices showed that input prices - the amount paid for materials and fuel by UK manufacturers - rose at an annual rate of 20.5% in January, the fastest pace since September 2008, and a rapid pick up in pace from the 15.8% figure seen in December.The prices of goods leaving factories were up 3.5%  ONS head of inflation Mike Prestwood said: ""The costs of raw materials and goods leaving factories both rose significantly, mainly thanks to higher oil prices and the weakened pound.""Chris Williamson, chief business economist at analysts IHS Markit, said: ""While the further upturn in price pressures will fuel speculation that interest rates may start to rise later in 2017, the most likely scenario remains one of policy staying on hold over the next two years as the economy navigates through Brexit.""Further upward pressure on prices looks inevitable in coming months as energy costs continue to climb and firms pass rising costs on to customers, pushing inflation up towards 3.0% in the second half of the year.""Wage growth has crept up to 2.8%. However, our expectation is that it will slow, or at least remain muted, in 2017 as the labour market cools, providing the Bank of England with leeway to keep policy on hold.""Consumer inflation as measured by the Retail Prices Index (RPI), which includes housing costs, rose to 2.6% in January from 2.5% the month before.A red light is flashing. It's been set off by a jump in what our manufacturers are having to pay for imported raw materials.They face the same fuel price hike as motorists. Metals have gone up, and foodstuffs as well.Companies aren't passing on the full 20.5% increase yet. They have only put their own prices up by 3.5% on average.But the ONS warns that the increases are starting to show up on the High Street.Shoppers are already faced with higher prices for imported cars, computers and kitchen equipment, the result of the drop in the value of the pound.Soon our own factories could be charging substantially more as well."

He said he would raise ""unnecessary"" tax burdens with the chief secretary to the treasury during the meeting.The Treasury said Scottish ministers had been advised of the tax situation before setting up national services.Most other police and fire services in the UK are regional bodies and do not have to pay VAT.The issue arose because Scotland's policing and fire services were previously controlled by local councils, which can claim back the tax - but the new national forces set up in 2013 are controlled by the Scottish government, which cannot.Mr Mackay said the police and fire services were struggling with the ""unnecessary"" burden of tax which they ""simple should not have to pay"".He said: ""This is a significant sum which other emergency services do not have to meet.""There is a significant difference in the way VAT affects emergency services across the UK, with Scottish police and fire services paying VAT when other territorial services in the UK do not have to. ""There needs to be a level playing field for such essential services.""As we continue to invest in our emergency services we will continue to press the UK government for Scottish emergency services to have the same ability to recover VAT as all other British and Northern Irish Forces.""Scottish Lib Dem MSP Liam McArthur said it was right that the VAT position was ""reconsidered"", but said the Scottish government should not use that as a ""smokescreen"" for its own failures.He said: ""The financial mess that Police Scotland find itself in is down to the SNP's botched centralisation. Ministers cannot duck that.""A Treasury spokeswoman said: ""In 2012 the Scottish government chose to make Scotland's police and fire services national rather than regional bodies. The Scottish government were advised in advance that by making this change Scottish police and fire services would become ineligible for VAT refunds.""First Minister Nicola Sturgeon raised the issue during a clash over police budgets with Tory leader Ruth Davidson at Holyrood in December.Ms Sturgeon argued that the UK government had changed the rules to exempt academy schools from VAT when they were set up and funded by the central government.She said there was ""£25m a year which should be going to our police service but is going to the Treasury"".Ms Davidson replied: ""The Scottish government was warned about VAT - it knew what would happen and it did not listen to parliament. You know that the first minister is in trouble when she cannot answer for herself but runs to 'Westminster bad'.""There have been a series of warnings from auditors about financial management within Scotland's police service, which faces a funding gap of up to £200m in the coming years."

2017-02-14,Cyber centre to make UK 'hardest target',https://web.archive.org//web/20170215070453/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-38964996,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe Queen was shown how hackers could target the UK's electricity supply as she opened a centre to protect the nation from cyber attacks.The National Cyber Security Centre - part of intelligence agency GCHQ - started work in October as part of a £1.9bn five-year strategy.Staff in Victoria, central London, will be joined by experts from the private sector to help identify threats.NCSC chief Ciaran Martin said: ""We want to make the UK the hardest target"".The secondments to the centre by 100 private sector employees will be funded by their own companies.Announcing the initiative, Chancellor Philip Hammond said the ""best and the brightest in industry"" will help ""test and to challenge the government's thinking"" in cyber security.He added: ""Government cannot protect business and the general public from the risks of cyber-attack on its own. It has to be a team effort. It is only in this way that we can stay one step ahead of the scale and pace of the threat that we face.""There were 188 cyber attacks classed by the NCSC as Category Two or Three during the last three months. And even though the UK has not experienced a Category One attack - the highest level, an example of which would have been the theft of confidential details of millions of Americans from the Office of Personnel Management - there is no air of complacency at the NCSC's new headquarters.  Ciaran Martin, the centre's chief executive, told the BBC: ""We have had significant losses of personal data, significant intrusions by hostile state actors, significant reconnaissance against critical national infrastructure - and our job is to make sure we deal with it in the most effective way possible."" As well as protecting against and responding to high-end attacks on government and business, the NCSC also aims to protect the economy and wider society. The UK is one of the most digitally dependent economies, with the digital sector estimated to be worth over £118bn per year - which means the country has much to lose. It is not just a crippling cyber-attack on infrastructure that could turn out the lights which worries officials, but also a loss of confidence in the digital economy from consumers and businesses, as a result of criminals exploiting online vulnerabilities.  A sustained effort was required by government and private sector working together to make the UK the hardest possible target, officials say.Russia has been the focus of recent concern, following claims it used cyber-attacks to interfere with the recent US presidential election. ""I think there has been a significant change in the Russian approach to cyber-attacks and the willingness to carry it out, and clearly that's something we need to be prepared to deal with,"" Mr Martin said. French and German officials have warned of the possibility of interference in their upcoming elections, but the NCSC's head said there was no evidence that a significant attack or compromise had yet taken place against the UK democratic process.  ""There has been an identifiable trend in Russian attacks in the West, in terms of focusing on critical national industries and political and democratic processes,"" Mr Martin added.""And so it follows from that that we will look to be sure we are protecting those sectors in the UK as well as we possibly can."" The centre will be working on a voluntary basis with political parties and giving advice to high-profile individuals - including MPs - on how to protect their sensitive data.The UK is already targeting computers in other countries being used for cyber-attack, particularly if there is no possibility of prosecution or for co-operation with authorities where the hackers are based. ""In the most serious cases, we have lawful powers where we can go after the infrastructure of adversaries - the infrastructure that people use to attack us - and we would do that in some of the most serious cases several dozen times a year,"" Mr Martin said.In the past, UK cyber protection was largely situated within GCHQ in Cheltenham, which was criticised by businesses and others as overly secretive. The NCSC aims to be more public facing and accessible. It will also protect a far wider range of sectors, rather than just government and national security-related industries, like defence. GCHQ will still be the parent body for the NCSC, meaning it can draw on the intelligence agency's skills and capabilities. Sometimes, the intelligence arm of GCHQ spots compromised networks as it watches adversaries move across the internet. It was through this type of work that GCHQ spotted the compromise of the US Democratic Party's information by Russian hackers, which it then informed US authorities about.The NCSC is working on trial services to pro-actively discover vulnerabilities in public sector websites, help government departments better manage spoofing of their email, and take down tens of thousands of phishing sites affecting the UK.

2017-02-14,UK welcomes Gambian Commonwealth return,https://web.archive.org//web/20170215070453/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-38968336,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkForeign Secretary Boris Johnson, who is in The Gambia, has said he is ""very pleased"" the West African state intends to rejoin the Commonwealth.His visit, the first to The Gambia by a British foreign secretary, comes weeks after long-time ruler Yahya Jammeh went into exile after losing elections. Mr Jammeh took The Gambia out of the Commonwealth in 2013, calling it a neo-colonial institution.New President Adama Barrow had promised a return to the 52-nation grouping.Before leaving for Banjul, Mr Johnson said: ""We will ensure this happens in the coming months. ""The strength of our partnerships show that Global Britain is growing in influence and activity around the world."" The Commonwealth secretariat said it welcomed the news, saying the formal process of rejoining would have to be agreed by the 52 heads of government.""When The Gambia left the Commonwealth in 2013, the heads of government... noted its decision with regret. We looked forward to the country's eventual return because it was part of our very close knit family and our doors have always remained open,"" a spokesman said.Last week, the European Union promised The Gambia an aid package of nearly £65m ($81m) - almost three years after freezing its assistance to the West African nation.Mr Barrow, who was sworn in last month, has also said The Gambia will reverse its move to withdraw from the International Criminal Court (ICC).In a statement on Monday, the government said it had written to UN chief Antonio Guterres to inform him of its decision ""to discontinue the withdrawal notice"".A former Gambian information minister had referred to the court last year as ""an International Caucasian Court for the persecution and humiliation of people of colour, especially Africans"".The move is a blow to Africa's anti-ICC lobby - which includes South Africa, Namibia and Burundi.At the annual African Union summit held this month, leaders called for a mass walk-out from the ICC, but faced opposition from other countries, including Nigeria, Senegal and The Gambia. The Foreign Office said as well as holding talks with Mr Barrow, Mr Johnson would visit the UK-funded Medical Research Council and speak to Chevening scholars and workers and employers in the tourism industry.The West African state is a popular holiday destination for Britons. Thousands had to be evacuated last month because of security concerns when Mr Jammeh was refusing to hand over power after losing December's elections.Mr Barrow, whose swearing-in was held in neighbouring Senegal, is to be inaugurated as president in a ceremony at the national stadium on Saturday.Several heads of state are expected to attend. Local dignitaries may include former Vice-President Alhagie Saihou Sabally, who local media said had returned to the country on Monday after 22 years in exile.Mr Jammeh, who took power in coup in 1994, is now in exile in Equatorial Guinea after West African leaders deployed troops to The Gambia to ensure he left power. Mr Johnson will go on to Ghana for talks with President Nana Akufo-Addo on Wednesday.Referring to him and Mr Barrow, Mr Johnson said: ""Their elections highlight the continuing strengthening of democracy in West Africa."""
2017-02-14,Brexit 'risk' to environmental standards,https://web.archive.org//web/20170215070453/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38959996,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkUpholding environmental standards after Brexit will be hard, peers have said, warning of ""worrying complacency"" in government about the risks ahead.An enforcement system similar to that provided by EU regulators and courts is needed to maintain existing protections, a Lords EU committee said.The UK, it added, will need to find new ways to shape EU policies and remain an influential voice on climate change.Ministers insist that standards will be maintained and even improved.But they have also said that leaving the EU is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to get rid of red tape holding farmers and others back.Under a process known as the Great Repeal Bill, all existing EU laws - including 40 years' worth of environmental regulations and directives - will be converted into domestic law before the government decides which to keep and which to jettison.Peers said the process - which will take place in parallel to the official Brexit negotiations over the next two years - would be ""immensely complex"".Publishing an assessment of the impact of Brexit on environmental standards, the cross-party committee said the European Commission, the EU's executive branch, and the European Court of Justice had played a vital role in enforcing the ""patchwork quilt"" of EU laws and regulations over recent decades.Without such a backstop, it was worried standards risk being eroded.""The government seems to be worryingly complacent about the loss of this enforcement regime,"" the report claimed. ""Whether it is a question of migratory birds, managing our oceans or air pollution, the environment transcends political boundaries and the UK's environment and Europe's will remain inextricably linked,"" said its chair, Lib Dem peer Lord Teverson.""The bottom line is that if the UK fails to honour environmental law, it will end up in court...  We are not convinced that the government has yet found a way to deliver the continuity of environmental protection that we all want to achieve.""It said an independent enforcement mechanism would still be needed, underpinned by a system of judicial oversight, to ensure central government, businesses and households live up to their environmental obligations.Even if the UK left the single market, businesses would still have to comply with basic environmental obligations if they wanted to trade with the EU, it argued.The committee is pressing the government to clarify whether funding for scientific research and sustainable infrastructure currently available through the European Investment Bank will continue after the UK leaves the EU.It also suggested that after Brexit, the UK would have to align itself with other like-minded countries outside the EU to ensure it remained an advocate for global action to tackle the effects of climate change.""The UK has been a world leader but in leaving the EU, we lose our strongest allies,"" the report said.Environment Secretary Andrea Leadsom has said Brexit is a chance to do away with needless bureaucracy, such as rules on how many crops farmers must plant each year, while upholding environmental and animal welfare standards.Her department has launched a consultation on a 25-year plan for the environment, focused on developing policies ""tailored to the needs of the UK, our species and our habitats"", including wildlife protections and sensitive management of farmland.Responding to the report, a Defra spokesman said: ""Our ambition is to be the first generation to leave the environment in a better state than we found it.""We are committed to building on our long history of wildlife and environmental protection and securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU."""
2017-02-14,Firms 'using gig workers to avoid tax',https://web.archive.org//web/20170215070453/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-38963653,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe head of Theresa May's inquiry into the way millions of people work has said there is evidence businesses are using self-employment laws to avoid tax.Matthew Taylor told the BBC that he wanted to see a new standard of ""fair and decent"" work which the public and private sector could sign up to.He said that new flexible ways of working were very good for many businesses and people, but said a complicated tax system and lack of clarity on the law meant that employers and employees often clashed.Some were deliberately using so-called gig workers to avoid paying contributions to the Treasury, he said.What is the 'gig' economy?""There is no question - and Phillip Hammond said this in the Autumn Statement - that when self-employment rose that reduces the tax take to the Exchequer,"" said Mr Taylor, who is head of the Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce.""There are reasons why that might be a good thing in terms of how those people are working, but it is clear to a certain extent what is actually going on is, people are creating forms of work for themselves, or businesses are creating forms of work, to try to avoid tax.""I think what should drive businesses is efficiency, productivity, innovation - not trying to evade tax.""So, if we can make the system one where those incentives are less strong, then that would be an improvement.""His comments come on the day a report by the Trades Union Congress says the tax hit from the growth of ""insecure work"" could be as high as £4bn ($5bn) a year.The TUC said that represented nearly a quarter of the social care budget spent in England.The study claims that generally lower incomes for the self-employed and those on zero-hours contracts (which have been criticised for giving employees little job security) means that less tax is collected.""The real worry here is the growth in low paid self-employment,"" Frances O'Grady, the general secretary of the TUC, told me.""We see that both in terms of zero hours, and low paid self-employment, that people are much less likely to be paid as much as people in secure work.""Research from the Institute for Fiscal Studies revealed last week that a permanently employed person pays an effective rate of tax of 31% on their incomeThat falls to 22% for self-employed people, who pay lower levels of national insurance.Businesses also save as they make no national insurance contributions and can avoid maternity and holiday pay entitlements.Because self-employed people tend to be on lower incomes they also receive higher levels of benefits, another cost to the Treasury.The Chancellor has made it clear he is concerned about the issue and is likely to announce reforms to the tax system so that the treatment of permanent and self-employed workers is more equitable.The first announcement on any major policy changes could come as soon as the Budget on 8 March.Mr Taylor said that most people involved in new ways of working ""choose and like"" flexible jobs and zero hours, but some employees may face exploitation.""This is a very complicated system,"" he said.""And as we have seen with cases like Pimlico plumbers last week, or Uber a few weeks before, that the courts are making judgments which people find quite confusing.""How can we introduce greater clarity so people know what their rights are, so business people designing a business can design it in the right way?""It is clear to me the review I am leading on only makes sense if we as a country are committed to the idea of all work being fair and decent and [that] provides people with the opportunity for fulfilment and development.""We have been great as a country at creating jobs, but not enough of those jobs are good jobs that provide people with opportunities to grow and to develop.""I am hoping that the review will mark a turning point, a point at which as a country we say it is not just the quantity of jobs that matters it is also the quality.""Mr Taylor said there may not be a need for new legislation and that workers on boards was not always the best option for businesses seeking to involve employees in how the firm is run.The Prime Minister initially appeared to support worker representation on boards before later backing away from the proposal.""Generally I think carrot works a bit better than stick,"" Mr Taylor said.""The problem with stick, when it comes to employment and tax, is that when you wave one stick people find a way round it and then you have to wave another stick and then you've got sticks all over the place.""So if there are ways of persuading people to do the right thing by encouragement, by support, through engagement, then that is the route I would prefer to use."""
2017-02-14,No 'quick fix' to cut prison population,https://web.archive.org//web/20170215070453/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-38955348,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkPrison numbers cannot be cut with ""dangerous quick fix"" solutions, the justice secretary has said.Liz Truss said the overcrowding is down to more criminals serving time for violence and sex crimes.She called for early interventions and better reforms but not shorter sentences, after a BBC investigation revealed chaos at one jail.The Howard League said the problems uncovered were seen in ""almost every prison in the country"".The Ministry of Justice said it would investigate disclosures by the Panorama programme about HMP Northumberland, which included widespread drug use, a lack of control, door alarms that did not go off in one block and a hole in an internal security fence.The BBC's home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said Ms Truss' speech focused on tackling the ""appalling"" number of re-offenders but did not feature a major policy announcement or sweeping changes in direction. The key points of her speech were:The current rate of re-offending within a year of conviction is 25.3%.Speaking to the Centre for Social Justice, Ms Truss said: ""Reductions by cap or quota, or by sweeping sentencing cuts are not a magic bullet, they are a dangerous attempt at a quick fix.""The most recent figures put the population of inmates in England and Wales at 85,490 in 2016 - up from 50,962 on average in 1995.Put prisoner safety first, charities sayWhat is going wrong with the prison system?Ms Truss said more sex offenders were being sent to prison as sentence lengths ""better reflect the severity"" of crimes like domestic violence, rape and child abuse.She rejected calls by Labour officials to reduce the number of prisoners in England and Wales by half, warning that such a move would be ""reckless"" and ""endanger the public"".Ms Truss said courts needed to be given the right tools to intervene before prison was an option.""There can never be an excuse for committing crime but too often people end up in prison because our interventions to tackle problems like drug addiction or mental health issues don't work as well as they should,"" she added.""Community sentences are most effective when they tackle the problems that contribute to the offender's crime."" The justice secretary said the Prison and Courts Bill - due to be published this month - will ""enshrine in law that reforming offenders is a key purpose of prison and that the Secretary of State has a responsibility for delivering it"".""This will usher in the biggest reform of our prisons in a generation. It will transform our prisons from offender warehouses to disciplined and purposeful centres of reform,"" she added.After her speech, Ms Truss said she would be meeting with the family of Dean Saunders, who died in Chelmsford Prison after he was found electrocuted in his cell.Andrew Neilson, spokesman for the Howard League for Penal Reform, said the justice secretary needed to act to get prison numbers down quickly.""She wants to reduce prison numbers in a long-term way through tackling reoffending but she won't look at sentencing reform to actually try and get numbers down quickly,"" he told the BBC.""And I'm afraid that without that sentencing reform we are going to continue to have ministers making similar speeches bemoaning the violence and the deaths in prisons because we will not get a solution without doing something about prison numbers."""

2017-02-14,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20170215070453/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThis article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide to the UK's vote to leave the European Union. It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 52% to 48%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who resigned on the day after losing the referendum. Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she says she will respect the will of the people. She has said ""Brexit means Brexit"" but there is still a lot of debate about what that will mean in practice especially on the two key issues of how British firms do business in the European Union and what curbs are brought in on the rights of European Union nationals to live and work in the UK. She set out more details of her negotiating hopes in her key speech on Brexit.The UK economy appears to have weathered the initial shock of the Brexit vote, although the value of the pound remains near a 30-year low, but opinion is sharply divided over the long-term effects of leaving the EU. Some major firms such as Easyjet and John Lewis have pointed out that the slump in sterling has increased their costs. Britain also lost its top AAA credit rating, meaning the cost of government borrowing will be higher. But share prices have recovered from a dramatic slump in value, with both the FTSE 100 and the broader FTSE 250 index, which includes more British-based businesses, trading higher than before the referendum. The Bank of England cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - a record low and the first cut since 2009 - after the vote and there has not been the economic slump or recession that some had predicted. The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it has to invoke an agreement called Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May has said she intends to trigger this process by the end of March 2017, meaning the UK will be expected to have left by the summer of 2019, depending on the precise timetable agreed during the negotiations. The government will also enact a Great Repeal Bill which will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. It is expected to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove.After a court battle, the UK's Supreme Court ruled in January that Parliament must be consulted before Article 50 is invoked. This is why a two line Brexit bill is currently making its way through Parliament. MPs have approved it after Labour MPs were told to support it. It is now heading to the House of Lords to be debated and voted on.Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These men - dubbed the Three Brexiteers - will play a central role in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although it will be Mrs May, as prime minister, who will have the final say. David Cameron's government did not do any emergency planning for Brexit ahead of the referendum and Mrs May has rejected calls to say what her negotiating goals are.Once Article 50 has been triggered, the UK will have two years to negotiate its withdrawal. But no one really knows how the Brexit process will work - Article 50 was only created in late 2009 and it has never been used. Former Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, now Chancellor, wanted Britain to remain in the EU, and he has suggested it could take up to six years for the UK to complete exit negotiations. The terms of Britain's exit will have to be agreed by 27 national parliaments, a process which could take some years, he has argued. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. The UK will continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making.Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Following Theresa May's Brexit recent speech we now know that the UK is not intending to stay in the EU's single market. Although there has been speculation for months about the issue, it would have meant the UK staying under the auspices of the European Court of Justice and having to allow unlimited EU immigration, under freedom of movement rules.Both sides want trade to continue after Brexit with the UK seeking a positive outcome for those who wish to trade goods and services"" - such as those in the City of London and wanting a ""comprehensive free trade deal"" giving the UK ""the greatest possible access"" to the single market. Mrs May says she wants the UK to reach a new customs union deal with the EU. A customs union is where countries agree not to impose tariffs on each others' goods and have a common tariff on goods coming in from elsewhere. The UK is currently part of the EU customs union but that stops the UK being able to do its own trade deals with other countries. Reality Check: How could customs union work?These terms have increasingly been used as debate focused on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people in order to maintain access to the EU single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result.The government has declined to give a firm guarantee about the status of EU nationals currently living in the UK, saying this is not possible without a reciprocal pledge from other EU members about the millions of British nationals living on the continent. EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, will be be able to stay, the chief civil servant at the Home Office has said. The rights of other EU nationals would be subject to negotiations on Brexit and the ""will of Parliament"", he added.A lot depends on the kind of deal the UK agrees with the EU. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions on EU nationals, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.Again, it depends on whether the UK government decides to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages. Citizens' Advice has reminded people their rights have not changed yet and asked anyone to contact them if they think they have been discriminated against following the Leave vote.Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested EU migrants who come to the UK as Brexit nears may not be given the right to stay. He has said there might have to be a cut-off point if there was a ""surge"" in new arrivals.People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote. The day-to-day spending impact is likely to be more significant. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it to remain at least 10% below where it was on 23 June, in the long term. This means imported goods will consequently get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have already been seen and the issue was most notably illustrated by the dispute between Tesco and Marmite's makers about whether prices would be put up or not in the stores.The latest UK inflation figures, for January, showed the CPI inflation rate rising to 1.8%, its highest level for two and a half years, with signs of more cost pressures set to feed through in the months to come.Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration.She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations. As mentioned above, the key issue is whether other EU nations will grant the UK access to the single market, if that is what it wants, while at the same time being allowed to restrict the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK.Mrs May has said she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. It is currently running at 330,000 a year, of which 184,000 are EU citizens, and 188,000 are from outside the EU - the figures include a 39,000 outflow of UK citizens.It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Liberal Democrats - who have just a handful of MPs - have vowed to halt Brexit and keep Britain in the EU if they were to win the next general election.Some commentators, including former House of Commons clerk Lord Lisvane, have argued that a further referendum would be needed to ratify whatever deal the UK hammers out with the EU, but there are few signs political leaders view this as a viable option.Yes. Theresa May has appeared keen to avoid a vote on her negotiating stance, to avoid having to give away her priorities, but Theresa May has said there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. It is worth mentioning that any deal also has to be agreed by the European Parliament - with British MEPs getting a chance to vote on it there.  While there could be limitations on British nationals' ability to live and work in EU countries, it seems unlikely they would want to deter tourists. There are many countries outside the European Economic Area, which includes the 28 EU nations plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway, that British citizens can visit for up to 90 days without needing a visa and it is possible that such arrangements could be negotiated with European countries.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. In theory, the government could, if it wanted, decide to change the colour, which is currently standardised for EU countries, says the BBC's Europe correspondent, Chris Morris.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketNo nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it is ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faces being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. A second independence referendum for the country is now ""highly likely"", she has said, although not in 2017. She has said she wants Scotland to stay in the single market and said Mrs May's decision to rule out the UK staying in the single market ""undoubtedly"" brings the referendum closer.Before his resignation Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said the impact in Northern Ireland would be ""very profound"" and that the whole island of Ireland should now be able to vote on reunification. But, speaking while she was still Northern Ireland Secretary, Theresa Villiers ruled out the call from Sinn Féin for a border poll, saying the circumstances in which one would be called did not exist. The land border is likely to be a key part of the Brexit talks. Theresa May said a priority for her would be negotiating a deal with the EU which allowed a common travel area between the UK and the Republic of Ireland.During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest. But his successor Theresa May has said she will keep it in place, at least for the current Parliament, which is due to last until 2020.So far there has been a cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. There are yet to be signs that rising inflation have worried the Bank of England  enough to consider raising interest rates.  But if that happened it would make mortgages and loans more expensive to repay - but would be good news for savers.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.Eurotunnel boss Jacques Gounon said last November the reintroduction of duty-free would be ""an incredible boost for my business"" but he later said  that remark had been ""light-hearted"". Erik Juul-Mortensen, president of the Tax Free World Association (TFWA) said after the referendum vote ""it is not possible to predict how Brexit will affect the duty free and travel retail industry, and it is wiser not to make assumptions about exactly what the impact will be.""  They are at the moment but no-one knows the longer term prospects for definite. The EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - is not an EU initiative. It was negotiated between countries within a group known as the European Economic Area, often simply referred to as the single market (plus Switzerland, which confusingly is not a member of the EEA, but has agreed access to the single market). Therefore, the future of Britons' EHIC cover could depend on whether the UK decided to sever ties with the EEA.Probably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report. In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two-thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.However, the UK government is committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, the UK government is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR. However, the EU has its own European Court of Justice, whose decisions are binding on EU institutions and member states.Its rulings have sometimes caused controversy in Britain and supporters of a Brexit have called for immediate legislation to curb its powers. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also cited sovereignty and democracy, and they wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Four of the biggest US banks have committed to helping maintain the City's position. But HSBC will move up to 1,000 jobs to Paris, the BBC understands. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Pest control firm Rentokil Initial says it could make £15m extra this year thanks to a weaker currency.Others are less optimistic. Hilary Jones, a director at UK cosmetics firm Lush said the company was ""terrified"" about the economic impact. She added that while the firm's Dorset factory would continue to produce goods for the UK market, products for the European market may be made at its new plant in Germany.Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After the Leave vote, the government will probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""As with most elements of the UK economy, not enough solid data has been published yet to accurately conclude the Brexit effect on house prices. Industry figures have pointed to ""uncertainty"" among buyers and sellers that could potentially change the housing market.So far, the most significant research has come from the respected Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which has published the conclusions of a survey of its members. This primarily records sentiment among surveyors.It found that house prices are expected to fall across the UK in the three months after the referendum vote. However, the dip in prices is only expected to persist over the 12 months from June in London and East Anglia, surveyors predict.House prices were already slowing in central London, owing to the fall-out from changes to stamp duty rules in April.Separate figures from property portal Rightmove suggested the average asking price of houses coming on to the market in England and Wales fell by 0.9%, or £2,647, in July compared with June. It said that agents had reported very few sales had fallen through as a result of the vote.Many potential first-time buyers would welcome a fall in house prices, with ownership among the young falling owing to affordability concerns. Investors in property, or those who have paid off a mortgage and hope to leave homes as inheritance would be unhappy with a long-term reduction in value.  Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law following the decision to leave the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" will not necessarily disappear overnight - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU means the UK will not be part of TTIP. It will have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Former Labour health secretary Lord Owen has said that because of TTIP (see answer above) the only way to protect the NHS from further privatisation was to get out of the EU."

2017-02-14,Race to reform,https://web.archive.org//web/20170215070453/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-38970265,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThere is a theory in politics that times of upheaval and uncertainty present opportunities as well as problems.It's best summed up in the saying that you should never let a good crisis go to waste - an aphorism so seductive that it has been attributed to all the usual historical suspects, from Machiavelli to Winston Churchill.It is perhaps in this spirit that the European Parliament has been debating how the EU is going to work in future, in the looming shadow of Brexit. The UK's vote to leave the EU, last June, came as a seismic shock to most MEPs. And many are quite open in their view that it amounts to a self-destructive decision by the British to uncouple themselves from one of modern history's primary drivers of peace and prosperity.British Eurosceptics of course would cast the Brexit vote in an entirely different light, and now foresee a future in which the UK will be free to make its fortune - and make its own new global trading relationships - unfettered from the dead hand of stifling Brussels bureaucracy.It will be years of course - perhaps many years - before we know who is on the right side of that debate.But one consequence of Brexit is already with us - the EU is now free to debate how it might work in the future without any input from the UK.In theory that should leave Europe's federalists freer to dream than they have been in the past. Britain's voice has generally been raised to question the wisdom and value of further integration that would give EU institutions greater powers at the expense of individual national governments. You would expect such dreams to be articulated best by Guy Verhofstadt - the former prime minister of Belgium, who now leads the liberal bloc in the European Parliament and who will represent that body in Brexit negotiations.In the debate on future reform Mr Verhofstadt said: ""The union is in crisis. The European Union doesn't have much friends: not at home, not abroad. ""The Union does not deliver anymore. Rather than to talk about an 'ever closer union', we have a union of 'too little, too late'. ""That's why people are angry: they see all these European institutions, all these summits, all these empty words, but they don't see enough results.""Mr Verhofstadt has a long list of suggested fixes for this continental malaise, including reducing or ending the right of individual members to opt out of collective decisions - something no British government would ever have countenanced. He has other ideas for how the EU should respond to Brexit too - including moving out of London the headquarters of two EU agencies: the European Banking Authority and the European Medicines Agency.But for now, at least, it seems radical visions for reform will be quietly kicked into touch.The vice-president of the EU Commission, Frans Timmermans, politely welcomed the display of ""vision"" in the proposals, but noted that most of the suggestions would require EU treaty change. He said simply: ""We have to acknowledge that treaty change is not on the top of the political agenda now, in member states in particular.""There are plenty of true believers in the European project who would see in the Verhofstadt proposals the start of a kind of counter-revolution against events which have dismayed them - including Brexit, the US election of Donald Trump and the strong opinion poll showing of insurgent parties in a number of European countries.Populist challenge brings Europe to crossroadsBrexit: All you need to knowBut for now a more cautious and pragmatic approach will prevail - partly because there is a general sense in Strasbourg and Brussels that the European institutions will have enough on their plates negotiating Brexit, without kicking off a parallel process of structural reform which would also take years.That takes us back to the idea that every crisis is an opportunity that shouldn't go to waste.There are, no doubt, those in Strasbourg who take that view - but it seems for the moment they are outweighed by those who feel that when you find yourself in the middle of a crisis - as they would see Brexit - the smartest course of action is to fix the crisis first and worry about the future later."
2017-02-14,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20170215070453/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-38957903,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe claim: Pensioners are on average £20 a week better off than working-age people.Reality Check verdict: The calculation made by the Resolution Foundation is for household income after housing costs. Before housing costs are taken into account, working-age households still have higher incomes than pensioner households.News that pensioner households are now better off than working-age families was widely reported on Monday.There have been reports for some time that incomes for pensioners have been growing faster than those for working-age people, largely as a result of pensions being protected by the triple-lock, while many working-age benefits have been frozen.The triple-lock guarantees that pensions rise by the same as average earnings, the consumer price index, or 2.5%, whichever is the highest.But the report from the Resolution Foundation was the first suggestion that the retired had actually overtaken the working-age group.The figures referred to the ""typical pensioner household"", by which it meant the median, which is the household for which half of pensioner households have higher income and half of them have lower incomes.In this case, a pensioner household is one in which at least one member is of pension age or older (65 for men, 64 for women) whether or not that person is working. There can also be working people in a pensioner household.But the important factor that has been mentioned little in the coverage is that the measure of income that the Resolution Foundation is using is one for income after housing costs have been paid. Taking income after housing costs makes a huge difference because pensioner households are more likely to own their own homes and to have relatively small or paid-off mortgages.The report says, for example, that 70% of the silent generation (born 1926-45) own their homes outright, while just over 40% of the baby boomers (1946-65) own theirs, with another 30% still having mortgages to pay.    The median income for both working-age and pensioner households is just over £20,000 a year, so housing costs would make a big difference.Also, the figures do not take account of people in care homes, which would be expected to increase housing costs for those of pension age.The Resolution Foundation confirms in the report that before housing costs are paid, the median working-age household still has a higher income than the median pensioner household.

2017-02-14,More than poppycock?,https://web.archive.org//web/20170215070453/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38950597,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkCould Jeremy Corbyn be replaced as Labour leader? And if so when? Those whispered questions have been echoing between Labour MPs and party apparatchiks at Westminster for weeks, for months. But today the guessing game has risen to a new pitch.In BBC interviews, we have been given answers of a sort by two of the most prominent members of the shadow cabinet.Yes, the Labour leader could be replaced. And the change could take place at the next election, ""if and when"" Mr Corbyn decides he has had enough.This time, the helpful guidance was not contained in any unattributed, anonymous briefing from a ""senior MP"" or ""party source"", who may or may not be keen to hasten Mr Corbyn on his way. They were the words of the party's newly appointed election co-ordinator in the shadow cabinet, Ian Lavery.In an interview with me for BBC Radio 5 live's Pienaar's Politics, I asked Mr Lavery if a report in the Sunday Times newspaper was true - that the party had conducted focus group research to gauge the potential appeal of two shadow cabinet colleagues, Rebecca Long-Bailey and Angela Raynor, as potential future leadership candidates.His denial was as emphatic as it was unsurprising. It was, he said, ""political poppycock.""""I think they are fantastic candidates. We have got lots of quality in the Labour Party and it's not just the two who have been mentioned,"" he added.More interesting was what he said next. ""There's plenty of leaders to pick from, if and when Jeremy decides, of his own volition, that it's not for him at the election."" He concluded, again helpfully: ""That isn't the case at this point in time.""So, in the space of one brief moment, the man now appointed to guide Labour through what could become a torrid series of electoral tests has volunteered that, in his judgement, Mr Corbyn may conceivably decide to pass on the leadership ""at the election"". And that there had been no such decision on Mr Corbyn's part ""at this point in time"". All of which can only crank up the volume of whispered speculation.Against this background, the verdict of Tom Watson, Labour's deputy Labour leader, in his interview with Andrew Marr, perhaps becomes a little more intriguing. He told Marr the party ""has got the leadership settled for this Parliament"".As for the mood in the party, much depends on the coming Parliamentary by-elections in the once supposedly ""safe"" constituencies of Stoke-on-Trent Central and Copeland in Cumbria.The new election co-ordinator, who replaced Jon Trickett amid a certain unease at the state of Labour's readiness for the fights ahead, was upbeat. Upbeat, at least up to a point. ""If you look at them separately, they are both relatively positive at this moment in time, despite what he polls might say, despite what individuals might say,"" he said. It was not the most ringingly confident assessment I can remember from an election strategist.If Labour loses one or both of these seats, expect the present simmering unease in the party to approach boiling point once again."

I don't think so. The coverage of one MP's Early Day Motion (EDM) of no confidence in the Speaker, in the wake of his comments about President Trump, is massively over-egged. First, it's an EDM. They are a form of parliamentary graffiti - a way of expressing an opinion, and nestling amongst the 946 EDMs on such subjects as the Queen's sapphire jubilee, diplomatic relations with Armenia, the Battle of Cable St and organised dog fighting, it has so far attracted a single signature - although that might change when MPs return from their holidays. But the more important point about EDMs is that some special parliamentary acrobatics are needed for them to be debated on the floor of the Commons. The government could provide the time, but it won't. An opposition party could give up some of its allocated time, but they won't. The Backbench Business Committee, which controls its own block of Commons time, could allocate a slot - but it almost certainly won't.So no debate. But what if a large number of MPs do, eventually, sign it? Will a shamed Speaker Bercow retire to his state dining room with a bottle of his own-brand whisky and a loaded revolver? I strongly doubt it. This Speaker saw off a coup attempt on the last day of the 2010 Parliament, when the coalition whips attempted to change the rules on Speaker elections as a precursor to an attempt to unseat him after the general election. That vote was effectively a direct attack on the Speaker - and was supported by 202 MPs. Yet Speaker Bercow did not resign. Like another Marmite politician, he's a fighter, not a quitter. And no-one should make the mistake of assuming he is universally loathed by Tory MPs. The Bercow phenomenon is a complex thing. On the one hand, he's a hardline parliamentary moderniser. On a cosmetic level, he has ditched the grand gold-embroidered robes worn by his predecessors, and most recently, presided over the decision to abandon the court dress worn by the Commons Clerks. But more importantly, he has opened up the procedure of the House, with historically important results.A few months back I wrote about how his rulings provided the parliamentary openings that led to pro-Brexit MPs cornering David Cameron into conceding the EU referendum. But he has also allowed 353 Urgent Questions, putting ministers on the spot on topical issues, so that the Commons is visible on the TV news, debating the issues of the moment. In the 21st Century that is essential. MPs also appreciate his brisk conduct of question times, giving many more their moment in the Parliamentary limelight.But then there's the other side of the coin. His put-downs can be brutal, and Tory MPs believe he targets them more often than the opposition - although the Lib Dems, still smarting from the duffing up of their leader, Tim Farron, at PMQs the other week, might argue that they get swatted too. Where other Speakers might have poured on a little honey ""the Right Hon Gentleman who is a distinguished parliamentarian, should know better…"", Bercow's repartee - like his admonition to Tory Tim Loughton ""the children's minister should stop acting like a child"" - has not been forgotten or forgiven by its targets. His stand-up shouting match with the then government Chief Whip, Patrick McLoughlin, on the floor of the Commons, may be the most spectacular example of a loss of temper, but it's not the only one. To quote Kipling, the burnt Speaker's bandaged finger goes wabbling back to the fire. But there are plenty of reasons why I expect him to survive. First there is no Commons majority to remove him. Support for the Speaker may be the love that dare not speak its name in the Conservative 1922 Committee, but there is a solid phalanx of Bercow-supporting Tories out there. As one senior member of this elusive group put it, ""with this Speaker, you have to take the rough with the smooth"". They believe his failings are a price worth paying for a Speaker who they believe facilitates tough scrutiny of the government.Second, the government has learned the lesson of its attempt to remove him on 26 March 2015, and doesn't want to place its dabs on the dagger this time. And without a government whipping operation behind it, any direct attempt to topple the Speaker is doomed.Third, MPs want to protect the Office. This is a more subtle point. If the Speaker is to be dethroned, his successor will feel vulnerable from day one. They will be less willing to offend, not just ministers, but pretty much anyone. And that means the rights of individual MPs and backbench groupings like the pre-referendum Brexiteers to make life difficult, may be less diligently enforced. This argument convinces a lot of older hands who are not obvious Bercow backers on other grounds.Fourth, he's going anyway. Perhaps later in this Parliament than some may hope, but he's been in the Chair since 2009, and that's a pretty long spell. So why mount a putsch when success is not guaranteed and there's a price to be paid?So when the Bercow era does end, it will be at a time of his choosing."
2017-02-14,Peering ahead,https://web.archive.org//web/20170215070453/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38918526,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkSharpen your pencils. Now Theresa May has her prize from the Commons, getting the Article 50 bill (she never wanted) through with no major changes, it makes its way to the red and gold end of the Palace of Westminster, to the Lords.The first debate is set for 20 February. More than 140 Peers have already put their names down to speak. But at that stage there probably won't be a vote. A week later the thornier more detailed committee stage begins. Then the last certain stage, the third reading and report is scheduled for 7 March. If it all goes according to the government's plan, which sources say is ""hugely unpredictable"", it would allow Theresa May to stick to her timetable and push the button for exit talks to start the next week, once the Bill has been rubber-stamped by the other Palace. (It's daft in this business to make too many predictions, but I'd put a fiver on that happening on Wednesday 15 March.)The government will have a bumpier ride in the Lords after a grumpy process in the Commons. The Lords is dramatically different because the government most certainly does not have a majority among peers. And, it is the Lords' express purpose to scrutinise and if needed, improve draft laws before sending them back along the corridor to the Commons.Overnight a government source suggested that the Lords had better jolly well let the Brexit bill go through, or else. Despite the sabre-rattling though, the atmosphere in the Lords is less febrile than that language might suggest.Downing Street this morning tried to dampen down the aggressive briefing. And one source in the Lords described the threat as ""total BS"" - I'll leave you to work that out.The main opposition leader, Baroness Smith, has made it plain on several occasions that although the Lords may try to tweak the Bill, Labour, broadly, has no intention of trying to block it. Her modus operandi is to ""hold to account, not hold to ransom"".The Liberal Democrats are more intent on making changes in the Lords, for it is there they can wield power, rather than in the Commons. But unless they have the support of Labour too, there is a limit to how much trouble they can cause.The chatter suggests the Lords will push for concessions from the government over the rights of EU citizens to stay here, reporting the progress of negotiations regularly to Parliament and maybe on a final ""meaningful vote"" for both Houses on the deal.It will be up to the government to decide whether to tweak the bill slightly as they did in the Commons or risk some defeats. Insiders predict it is likely the Lords may end up sending back the bill to the Commons once, as ""ping pong"" to force the government to make a change or two. But even senior Lib Dem sources don't expect hostile stand-offs for weeks on end. The Lords will make their voices heard, there is no question about that and the Article 50 bill could run into trouble. It would be wrong to suggest that ministers don't anticipate a tricky time. But today at least, whatever the sabre-rattling from some parts of government, this historic piece of legislation looks likely to be the subject of a few skirmishes in the Lords, rather than an apocalyptic battle.

2017-02-14,Ward-by ward,https://web.archive.org//web/20170215070453/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38762034,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe BBC has obtained a more localised breakdown of votes from nearly half of the local authorities which counted EU referendum ballots last June.This information provides much greater depth and detail in explaining the pattern of how the UK voted. The key findings are:A statistical analysis of the data obtained for over a thousand individual local government wards confirms how the strength of the local Leave vote was strongly associated with lower educational qualifications.Wards where the population had fewer qualifications tended to have a higher Leave vote, as shown in the chart. If the proportion of the local electorate with a degree or similar qualification was one percentage point lower, then on average the leave vote was higher by nearly one percentage point.Using ward-level data means we can compare voting figures in this way to the local demographic information collected in the 2011 census. Of the main census statistics, this is the one with the greatest association with how people voted. In statistical terms the level of educational qualifications explains about two-thirds of the variation in the results between different wards. The correlation is strong, whether based on assessing graduate and equivalent qualifications or lower-level ones. This ward-by-ward analysis covers 1,070 individual wards in England and Wales whose boundaries had not changed since the 2011 census, about one in nine of the UK's wards. We had very little ward-level data from Scotland, and none from Northern Ireland.It should be noted, however, that many ward counts also included some postal votes from across the counting area, and therefore some variation between wards will have been masked by the random allocation of postal votes for counting. This makes the results less accurate geographically, but we can still use the information to explore broad national and local patterns.  Adding age as a second factor significantly helps to further explain voting patterns. Older populations were more likely to vote Leave. Education and age combined account for nearly 80% of the voting variation between wards. Ethnicity is a smaller factor, but one which also contributed to the results. Adding that in means that now 83% of the variation in the vote between wards is explained. White populations were generally more pro-Leave, and ethnic minorities less so.  However, there were some interesting differences between London and elsewhere.The ethnic dimension is particularly interesting when examining the outliers on the graph that compares the Leave vote to levels of education.There are numerous wards towards the bottom left of the graph where electorates with lower educational qualifications nevertheless produced low Leave and high Remain votes. This is where the link between low qualifications and Leave voting breaks down. It turns out that these exceptional wards have high ethnic minority populations, particularly in Birmingham and Haringey in north London. In contrast, there are virtually no dramatic outliers on the other side of the line, where comparatively highly educated populations voted Leave. Only one point on the graph stands out - this is Osterley and Spring Grove in Hounslow, west London, a mainly ethnic minority ward which had a Leave vote of 63%. While this figure does include some postal votes, they are not nearly enough to explain away this unusual outcome.In fact, in Ealing and Hounslow, west London boroughs with many voters of Asian origin, the ethnic correlation was in the other direction to the national picture: a higher number of Asian voters was associated with a higher Leave vote.This powerful link to educational attainment could stem from the lower qualified tending to feel less confident about their prospects and ability to compete for work in a competitive globalised economy with high levels of migration. On the other hand some commentators see it as primarily reflecting a ""culture war"" or ""values conflict"", rather than issues of economics and inequality. Research shows that non-graduates tend to take less liberal positions than graduates on a range of social issues from immigration and multi-culturalism to the death penalty.   The former campaign director of Vote Leave, Dominic Cummings, argues that the better educated are more prone to holding irrational political opinions because they are more driven by fashion and a group mentality. Of course this assessment does not imply that Leave voters were almost all poorly educated and old, and Remain voters well educated and young. The Leave side obviously attracted support from many middle class professionals, graduates and younger people. Otherwise it couldn't have won. While there was undoubtedly a lot of voting which cut across these criteria, the point of this analysis is to explore how different social groups most probably voted - and it is clear that education, age and ethnicity were crucial influences.  After these three key factors are taken into account, adding in further demographic measures from the census does little to increase the explanation of UK-wide voting patterns. However, this does not reflect the distinctively more pro-Remain voting in Scotland, since we are short of Scottish data at this geographical level. It is clear as well that in a few specific locations high student numbers were also very relevant. To a certain extent, using the level of educational qualifications as a measure combines both class and age factors, with working class and older adults both tending to be less well qualified.But the association between education and the voting results is stronger than the association between social or occupational class and the results. This is still true after taking the age of the local population into account.This suggests that voters with lower qualifications were more likely to back Leave than the better qualified, even when they were in the same social or occupational class.The existence of a significant connection between Leave voting and lower educational qualifications had already been suggested by analysis of the published referendum results from the official counting areas.The data we have obtained strengthens this conclusion, because voting patterns can now be compared to social statistics from the 2011 census at a much more detailed geographical level than by the earlier studies. The BBC analysis is also consistent with opinion polling (for example, from Lord Ashcroft, Ipsos Mori and YouGov) that tried to identify the characteristics of Leave and Remain voters.  The data we have collected can be used to illustrate the sort of places where the Leave and Remain camps did particularly well: it is hard to imagine a more glaring social contrast than that between the deprived, poorly educated housing estates of Brambles and Thorntree in Middlesbrough, and the privileged elite colleges of Market ward in central Cambridge. It is important to bear in mind, however, that most of the voting figures mentioned below also include some postal votes, so they should be treated as approximate rather than precise.  It is also important to note that the examples are limited to the places for which we were able to obtain localised information, which was only a minority of areas. The rest of the country may well contain even starker instances.Of the 1,283 individual wards for which we have data, the highest Leave vote was 82.5% in Brambles and Thorntree, a section of east Middlesbrough with many social problems. Ward boundaries have changed since the 2011 census, but in that survey the Thorntree part of the area had the lowest proportion of people with a degree or similar qualification of anywhere in England and Wales, at only 5%. And according to Middlesbrough council, the figure for the current Brambles and Thorntree ward is even lower, at just 4%. Second highest was 80.3% in Waterlees Village, a poor locality within Wisbech, Cambridgeshire. This area has seen a major influx of East European migrants who have been doing low-paid work in nearby food processing factories and farms, with tensions between them and British residents. Other wards with available data which had the strongest Leave votes were congregated in Middlesbrough, Canvey Island in Essex, Skegness in coastal Lincolnshire, and Havering in east London.The highest Remain vote was 87.8% in Market ward in central Cambridge, an area with numerous colleges and a high student population, in a city which was strongly pro-Remain.This was followed by Ashley ward  (85.6%) in central Bristol, a district featuring ethnic diversity, gentrification and alternative culture.Next highest was Northumberland Park (85.0%) in Haringey, north London, which has a substantial black population. Other wards with available data which had the strongest Remain votes were generally located in Cambridge, Bristol and the multi-ethnic London boroughs of Haringey and Lambeth. The count for Ashburton in Croydon, south London, split 50-50 exactly, with both Leave and Remain getting 3,885 votes, but that did include some postal ballots.As for being nearest to the overall result, the combined count of Tulketh and University, neighbouring wards near the centre of Preston, was 51.92% for leave, very close to the UK wide figure of 51.89%. The individual ward of Barnwood in Gloucester had Leave at 51.94%. Both figures however contain some postal votes.Given that a few councils provided even more detailed data down to the level of polling districts, it is possible to identify some very small localities that were nicely representative of the national picture. The 527 voters in the neighbouring districts of Kirk Langley and Mackworth in Amber Valley in Derbyshire, whose two ballot boxes were counted together, produced a leave proportion of 51.99%. And this figure is not contaminated by any postal votes.So journalists (or anyone else for that matter) who seek a microcosm of the UK should perhaps visit the Mundy Arms pub in Mackworth, the location for that district's polling station.Similarly, the 427 voters in the combined neighbouring polling districts of Chiddingstone Hoath and Hever Four Elms to the south of Sevenoaks in Kent delivered a leave vote of 51.6% (again, without any postal votes).The data obtained points to 269 areas of various sizes (wards, clusters of wards or constituencies) which had a different Leave/Remain outcome compared to the official counting area of which they were part.This consists of 150 areas which backed Remain but were part of Leave-voting counting areas; and 119 in the other direction. The detailed information therefore gives us an understanding of how the electorate voted which is more variegated than the officially published results.Every one of Scotland's 32 counting areas came down on the Remain side. Yet, despite the fact that most Scottish councils did not give us much detailed information, we can nevertheless identify a few smaller parts of the country which actually backed Leave.A cluster of six wards in the Banff and Buchan area in north Aberdeenshire had a strong Leave majority of 61%. There is much local discontent within the fishing industry of this coastal district about the EU's common fisheries policy.An Taobh Siar agus Nis, a ward at the northern end of the Isle of Lewis in Na h-Eileanan an Iar (Western Isles), also voted Leave, if very narrowly. And at a smaller geographical level, in Shetland the 567 voters in the combined polling districts of Whalsay and South Unst had an extremely high Leave vote of 81%. The island of Whalsay is a fishing community, where EU rules have been controversial and in 2012 numerous skippers were heavily fined for major breaches of fishing quotas.Ealing and Hounslow are neighbouring multi-ethnic boroughs in the west of London with large Asian populations, where - in contrast to the national picture - non-white ethnicity was associated with voting Leave, particularly in Ealing. Both boroughs shared a varied internal pattern of prosperous largely white areas voting strongly Remain, poorer largely white areas preferring Leave, and the Asian areas tending to be more evenly split.Ealing voted 60% Remain, with Southfield ward hitting 76%, but in contrast the Southall wards which are over 90% ethnic minority were close to 50-50.In Hounslow the richer wards in Chiswick in the east of the area voted heavily Remain (73%), but the poorer largely white wards at the opposite western end in Feltham and Bedfont voted Leave (64-66%). Osterley and Spring Grove was also 63% Leave, the highest Leave vote in any individual ward in the UK with a non-white majority for which we have data. The south London borough of Bromley narrowly voted Remain. Those parts which did not do so by a significant margin were the Cray Valley wards, largely poor white working class areas; and Biggin Hill and Darwin wards, locations to the south which contain more open countryside and lie outside the built-up commuter belt. In Croydon in south London, places which voted Leave by substantial amounts were New Addington and Fieldway, neighbouring wards with large council estates. Beyond the areas with the strongest backing for Leave and Remain, examining the detailed breakdown of votes in various places gives greater insight into the pattern of support for the two sides - as can be seen from the following examples.In several places (for example, Birmingham, Bristol, Nottingham, Portsmouth) there was a strong contrast between the Leave-voting populations of large, rundown, predominantly white, housing estates in the urban periphery, versus Remain-voting populations in inner city areas with large numbers of ethnic minorities and sometimes students.Birmingham had several wards with large Remain votes, although the city as a whole narrowly voted Leave.  These pro-Remain wards tended to be the more highly educated, better off localities, or minority ethnic areas which strongly backed Remain despite low levels of educational qualifications. I have written about this before. In Blackburn with Darwen, Bastwell ward had the highest Remain vote at 65%, compared to only 44% in the area as a whole. This ward has an ethnic minority proportion of over 90%. Other Blackburn wards which voted Remain were also ones with high minority populations.Bradford voted to Leave (54%), but the area included some starkly contrasting places which went over 60% Remain: the prosperous, genteel, spa town of Ilkley, and strongly ethnic minority wards in the city, such as Manningham and Toller.Bristol voted strongly Remain on the whole (62%), but there were some striking exceptions, particularly the large, deprived, mainly white estates to the south of the city. Hartcliffe and Withywood backed Leave at 67%. Similar neighbouring wards (Hengrove and Whitchurch Park, Filwood, Bishopsworth and Stockwood) also voted Leave, as did the more industrial area of Avonmouth and Lawrence Weston to the north west of the city.As a county Cornwall voted to Leave. But one of its six parliamentary constituencies, Truro and Falmouth, voted 53% to Remain, possibly linked to a significant student population.In Lincoln, which voted 57% to Leave, Carholme ward stands out as very different - it voted 63% to Remain. This ward includes Lincoln University, and 43% of the residents are students Middlesbrough voted 65% to Leave. As already noted, it had several wards with extremely high leave votes of over 75%. But one ward, Linthorpe, voted very narrowly to Remain - a comparatively well-to-do inner suburb which includes an art college; and another ward, Central, which contains Teesside University, nearly did. Mole Valley in Surrey exhibited a dramatic contrast between two neighbouring districts with very different demographics and housing. The highest Remain vote was in the very prosperous location of Dorking South, which voted 63% Remain, but the neighbouring ward of Holmwoods, dominated by large estates on the edge of the town of Dorking, voted 57% Leave, the area's highest Leave vote. Nottingham voted narrowly to Leave, but the inner city ward of Radford and Park voted 68% Remain. This has both a comparatively high proportion of ethnic minorities and considerable numbers of students from two nearby universities. There was a lot of variation within the area. Bulwell - a market town to the north of the city with many social problems - voted 69% Leave  There was also a high Leave vote in the housing estate locations of the Clifton wards in the south of Nottingham.Oldham voted to Leave at 61%, but Werneth, the city ward with the highest ethnic minority population, voted Remain (57%). Other wards with high minority populations also voted Remain.In Oxford the cluster of polling districts which included Blackbird Leys and other deprived estates on the southern edge of the city voted to Leave at 51%. In contrast the central areas containing colleges, university buildings and student accommodation voted to Remain at over 80%.Plymouth voted 60% Leave, but Drake ward which includes the university had the city's highest Remain vote at 56%. Portsmouth was another place with wide variation. Paulsgrove ward, with its large estate on the edge of the city, had the highest Leave vote at 70%, whereas at the other end of the spectrum Central Southsea, an inner city ward and student area, voted 57% Remain.Rochdale voted 60% Leave. The place which bucked this trend by voting 59% Remain, Milkstone and Deeplish, was the most predominantly ethnic minority ward. Central Rochdale had the second highest Remain vote and is the other ward that is mainly not white. Walsall voted strongly Leave (68%). The only ward which voted Remain, Paddock, is both a comparatively prosperous and multi-ethnic locality.A few councils released their data at remarkably localised levels, down even to individual polling districts (ie ballot boxes) in the case of Blackburn with Darwen and Bracknell Forest, or clusters of two/three/four districts, in the case of Amber Valley, Brentwood, Sevenoaks, Shetland, South Oxfordshire, and Tewkesbury.This provides very local and specific data, in some cases just for neighbourhoods of hundreds of voters.At its most detailed this reveals that the 110 people who cast their votes in the ballot box at St. Alban's Primary School in central Blackburn split 56-52 in favour of Remain, with two spoilt papers.It also discloses stark contrasts in some neighbouring locations. The 953 people who voted at Little Harwood community centre in north Blackburn had a Leave vote of only 31%, while the 336 electors who voted in the neighbouring ballot box at Roe Lee Park primary school produced a Leave percentage over twice as high, at 64%.The very detailed data we obtained also provides some rare evidence on the views of postal compared to non-postal voters. Campaign strategists have often deliberated on whether the two groups vote differently and should be given separate targeted messages.Most places mixed boxes of postal and non-postal votes for counting, so generally it's not possible to draw comparative conclusions. However there were a few exceptions which recorded them separately, or included a very small number of non-postal votes with the postals.These figures indicate that postal voters were narrowly less likely to back Leave than voters in polling stations. Data covering five counting areas with about 260,000 votes shows that in these places the roughly one in five electors who voted by post backed Leave at 55.4%, one percentage point lower than the local non-postal support for Leave of 56.4%.The counting areas involved are Amber Valley, East Cambridgeshire, Gwynedd, Hyndburn and North Warwickshire.Since the referendum the BBC has been trying to get the most detailed, localised voting data we could from each of the counting areas.  This was a major data collection exercise carried out by my colleague George Greenwood. We managed to obtain voting figures broken down into smaller geographical units for 178 of the 399 referendum counting areas (380 councils in England, Wales and Scotland, with a separate tally in Gibraltar, while in Northern Ireland results were issued for the 18 constituencies). This varied between data for individual local government wards, wards grouped into clusters, and constituency level data. In a few cases the results supplied were even more localised than ward level. Overall the extra data covers a wide range of different areas and kinds of councils across the UK. Electoral returning officers are not covered by the Freedom of Information Act, so releasing the information was up to the discretion of councils. While some were very willing, in other cases it required a lot of persistence and persuasion. Some councils could not supply any detailed data because they mixed all ballot boxes prior to counting; some did possess more local figures but simply refused to disclose them to us. Others did provide data, but the combinations in which ballot boxes were mixed before counting were too complex to fit ward boundaries neatly.A few places such as Birmingham released their ward by ward data following the referendum on their own initiative, but in most cases the information had to be obtained by us requesting it directly, and sometimes repeatedly, from the authority."

2017-02-14,Meet the EU's chief Brexit negotiator,https://web.archive.org//web/20170215070453/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37542204,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe British papers love a French villain at the heart of the EU.Is Michel Barnier about to succeed Jacques Delors as the object of their affection? The veteran Gaullist already has form.When he was Commissioner for the Internal Market and Financial Services, Mr Barnier was dubbed ""the most dangerous man in Europe"" after taking on the banking sector and championing a cap on bankers' bonuses. But while he alarmed some in the City, and will probably do so again, he also won grudging respect as a tough but even-handed negotiator.He will need all those skills and more in his new role - chief Brexit negotiator at the European Commission. And having moved seamlessly between big jobs in Paris and Brussels - French foreign minister, Commissioner, MEP - he looks well prepared. ""Don't ask me to tell you what will be at the end of the road, we haven't begun to walk yet,"" he told a conference in Brussels last month. Mr Barnier will stick closely to the official EU position of ""no negotiation without notification"" - waiting for the UK to trigger Article 50 to start the formal process of withdrawal. But he's clearly eager to get going.""I am waiting to begin,"" he said. ""I will be ready tomorrow to negotiate, frankly speaking.""And he will bring with him an instinctive pro-European agenda, and a deep knowledge of the workings of the single market.His deputy as chief Brexit negotiator is a German trade expert, Sabine Weyand, adding to the impression that Mr Barnier will lead a team that means business.One of the biggest challenges he (and his boss Jean-Claude Juncker) faces, is to ensure that representatives of the big member states don't sideline him in the Brexit divorce negotiations.But Mr Barnier's long career in French politics means he could well have the ear of the Elysee Palace, especially if - as looks likely - a centre-right candidate wins the French presidency next year. The stakes are so high that there are bound to be some clashes.Mr Barnier has sparred with the UK's Minister for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, before, when the men both served as Europe ministers in the 1990s. It is another reminder that Michel Barnier is a politician first and foremost, rather than a bureaucrat. There have certainly been criticisms - a dash of vanity, a lack of attention to detail. His career has had plenty of downs as well as ups.But he will defend his European vision to the end, and the British government would do well not to underestimate him.At the height of the eurozone crisis, Mr Barnier always refused (politely) to do broadcast interviews in English.""One wrong word,"" he told me once with a smile, ""and we could move markets.""The next few years will be equally challenging."

It's me who has made this mistake, and one I feel absolutely terrible about.""The Sun reported that Ms Roughley's resignation had been turned down.Mr Nuttall was pressed about the posts on his website during an interview with Liverpool's Radio City station on Tuesday.In the first from August 2011, the Bootle-born politician urged the government to release files on the Hillsborough tragedy.He was quoted as saying: ""Without them being made public we will never get to the bottom of that appalling tragedy when 96 Liverpool fans including close personal friends of mine lost their lives.""In a second release published six months later, he was quoted as saying: ""I lost close friends at the match and understand as well as anyone how deep the scars of that tragedy go."" But during his radio interview, Mr Nuttall conceded the comments were inaccurate. ""I haven't lost anyone who was a close personal friend,"" he said. ""It was people I knew through football and things like that.""The comments were ""wrong"" and had not ""come from him"", he added.

But a recent article in the Guardian quoted a number of people - including an unnamed former classmate and two Labour politicians - questioning why he had not spoken about his experience.He later responded to questions about whether he was at the match by speaking in more detail of the effect the occasion had on him.""As a 12-year-old boy, I travelled to Sheffield that day, as did so many others, to enjoy watching the team that I loved,"" he said.""From the upper tier of the Leppings Lane End, I watched the events of that day unfold with horror...

2017-02-15,PM 'looking forward' to welcoming Trump,https://web.archive.org//web/20170215070453/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38967075,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkTheresa May has said she looks forward to welcoming Donald Trump to the UK later this year after discussing his planned state visit on the phone.Last month's invitation, coming so soon after the US President took office, has proved highly controversial.Speaker John Bercow has said Mr Trump should not address Parliament during the trip in light of the row over his travel ban and comments about women. And 1.8 million people have signed a petition against the state visit.The petition, saying that the visit should be downgraded, will be debated by MPs next week alongside one backing the visit. The government said it recognised the ""strong views"" expressed but looked forward to welcoming the US president once details have been arranged.Mrs May spoke to the US president about the trip as part of their ""regular engagement"", Downing Street said.""They discussed a range of issues, including trade and security and also discussed the president's upcoming state visit to the UK,"" a spokesman said. ""The prime minister said she looks forward to welcoming him later this year.""The invitation was issued during Prime Minister Theresa May's talks with the US president in Washington last month. The government has rejected calls for the visit to be put on hold or scaled back in light of the controversy surrounding the first month of the Trump presidency. More than 1.8 million people signed a petition claiming the visit would cause the Queen ""embarrassment"" while a counter petition calling for the visit to go ahead attracted more than 309,000 signatures.Both petitions will be debated by the House of Commons on 20 February.The government responds to all petitions on its website if they are signed by more than 10,000 people, and a similar response has been issued in support of the one calling for the state visit to go ahead.Published on the petitions website, they say the government believes Mr Trump ""should be extended the full courtesy of a state visit"", adding: ""This invitation reflects the importance of the relationship between the United States of America and the United Kingdom.""At this stage, final dates have not yet been agreed for the state visit.""Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon rejected suggestions that the government was out of step with public opinion over the issue.""I think the government has a duty obviously to have good relations with the US, probably our closest ally and most important economic trading partner,"" he told Sam Walker on BBC Radio 5 live Daily.""It is equally important in a democracy that you accept the results of a democracy. President Trump has been elected now by the US and we work with him.""Solicitor Graham Guest, from Leeds, started the online petition that said Mr Trump should be allowed into the UK but not to make a state visit.It came amid protests at the president's executive order preventing people from seven mainly-Muslim countries from entering the US."
2017-02-15,Government rebuts defence spend claim,https://web.archive.org//web/20170215070453/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38969697,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe government has rejected a think tank's claim that it missed Nato's target of spending at least 2% of national income on defence.In a new report, the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) claimed spending had fallen to 1.98% in 2016 as a result of the British economy growing faster than the defence budget.But a Ministry of Defence spokesman said its figures were ""wrong"".It cited Nato's own estimate that the UK met the 2% target.The alliance says only the UK, US, Poland, Greece and Estonia met the target, which was set in 2006, last year.The UK has called on other countries to increase their spending, and US President Donald Trump has complained of European members failing to pay their fair share for collective defence arrangements.In its report, the IISS said only Greece and Estonia spent 2% or more, with the UK falling short by about £380m.Its researchers said there was ""no shared understanding"" of what constitutes a nation's defence expenditure, pointing out that Nato's definition includes not only defence ministry budgets but also pensions, expenditure for peacekeeping and humanitarian operations, and research and development costs.They added that ""very different results"" could be reached depending on how expenditure is converted into US dollars and that different GDP figures could also distort the figures.They also questioned the ""increasingly prominent"" role of the 2% figure, saying it ""only provides a limited representation of countries' defence capabilities and commitments"".""Ultimately, it is the output that matters,"" they added.The Ministry of Defence dismissed the think tank's assessment of the UK's spending.""These figures are wrong,"" it said. ""Nato's own figures clearly show that the UK spends over 2% of its GDP on defence.""Our defence budget is the biggest in Europe, the second largest in Nato, and it is growing each year as we invest £178bn in new equipment and the UK steps up globally, with new ships, submarines and aircraft over the next decade.""The MoD said the IISS calculation may have been affected by fluctuations in exchange rates.The think tank's report was released ahead of a meeting of Nato defence ministers in Brussels on Wednesday.At a press conference ahead of the summit, Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg  unveiled figures showing that European members and Canada had between them increased defence spending by 3.8% above inflation last year.Mr Stoltenberg said the figures were ""significantly higher than what we had originally foreseen"" and showed Nato had ""turned a corner"" after many years of steep cuts in spending.He said: ""Regardless of language, the most important thing is that we increase defence spending and that is exactly what we are doing.""MPs have previously questioned the way the UK government records its spending to meet the 2% target.In April, the cross-party defence committee said including what is spent on intelligence gathering and war pensions could be seen as ""creative accounting""."
2017-02-15,UK inflation highest since June 2014,https://web.archive.org//web/20170215070453/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-38966692,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkInflation has reached its highest rate for two-and-a-half years, mainly as a result of the rising price of fuel.Annual inflation as measured by the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) reached 1.8% last month, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said, up from a rate of 1.6% in December.It is the fourth consecutive month that the rate has risen and takes inflation to its highest since June 2014.Fuel prices hit a two-year high in early February, according to the RAC.As well as fuel, the ONS said food prices also contributed to the rise in inflation, as prices were unchanged between December and January, having fallen a year ago.Offsetting these factors, the prices of clothing and footwear fell by more than they did 12 months ago.Inflation means inflation, but who wins?The increase in the inflation rate takes it closer to the Bank of England's target rate of 2%, which was last seen in December 2013. Inflation is widely expected to pick up this year as a result of the weaker pound, which is making imported goods more expensive. Earlier this month, the Bank of England said it expected the inflation rate would hit 2.7% next year. Separate ONS figures for producer prices showed that input prices - the amount paid for materials and fuel by UK manufacturers - rose at an annual rate of 20.5% in January, the fastest pace since September 2008, and a rapid pick up in pace from the 15.8% figure seen in December.The prices of goods leaving factories were up 3.5%  ONS head of inflation Mike Prestwood said: ""The costs of raw materials and goods leaving factories both rose significantly, mainly thanks to higher oil prices and the weakened pound.""Chris Williamson, chief business economist at analysts IHS Markit, said: ""While the further upturn in price pressures will fuel speculation that interest rates may start to rise later in 2017, the most likely scenario remains one of policy staying on hold over the next two years as the economy navigates through Brexit.""Further upward pressure on prices looks inevitable in coming months as energy costs continue to climb and firms pass rising costs on to customers, pushing inflation up towards 3.0% in the second half of the year.""Wage growth has crept up to 2.8%. However, our expectation is that it will slow, or at least remain muted, in 2017 as the labour market cools, providing the Bank of England with leeway to keep policy on hold.""Consumer inflation as measured by the Retail Prices Index (RPI), which includes housing costs, rose to 2.6% in January from 2.5% the month before.A red light is flashing. It's been set off by a jump in what our manufacturers are having to pay for imported raw materials.They face the same fuel price hike as motorists. Metals have gone up, and foodstuffs as well.Companies aren't passing on the full 20.5% increase yet. They have only put their own prices up by 3.5% on average.But the ONS warns that the increases are starting to show up on the High Street.Shoppers are already faced with higher prices for imported cars, computers and kitchen equipment, the result of the drop in the value of the pound.Soon our own factories could be charging substantially more as well."

He said he would raise ""unnecessary"" tax burdens with the chief secretary to the treasury during the meeting.The Treasury said Scottish ministers had been advised of the tax situation before setting up national services.Most other police and fire services in the UK are regional bodies and do not have to pay VAT.The issue arose because Scotland's policing and fire services were previously controlled by local councils, which can claim back the tax - but the new national forces set up in 2013 are controlled by the Scottish government, which cannot.Mr Mackay said the police and fire services were struggling with the ""unnecessary"" burden of tax which they ""simple should not have to pay"".He said: ""This is a significant sum which other emergency services do not have to meet.""There is a significant difference in the way VAT affects emergency services across the UK, with Scottish police and fire services paying VAT when other territorial services in the UK do not have to. ""There needs to be a level playing field for such essential services.""As we continue to invest in our emergency services we will continue to press the UK government for Scottish emergency services to have the same ability to recover VAT as all other British and Northern Irish Forces.""Scottish Lib Dem MSP Liam McArthur said it was right that the VAT position was ""reconsidered"", but said the Scottish government should not use that as a ""smokescreen"" for its own failures.He said: ""The financial mess that Police Scotland find itself in is down to the SNP's botched centralisation. Ministers cannot duck that.""A Treasury spokeswoman said: ""In 2012 the Scottish government chose to make Scotland's police and fire services national rather than regional bodies. The Scottish government were advised in advance that by making this change Scottish police and fire services would become ineligible for VAT refunds.""First Minister Nicola Sturgeon raised the issue during a clash over police budgets with Tory leader Ruth Davidson at Holyrood in December.Ms Sturgeon argued that the UK government had changed the rules to exempt academy schools from VAT when they were set up and funded by the central government.She said there was ""£25m a year which should be going to our police service but is going to the Treasury"".Ms Davidson replied: ""The Scottish government was warned about VAT - it knew what would happen and it did not listen to parliament. You know that the first minister is in trouble when she cannot answer for herself but runs to 'Westminster bad'.""There have been a series of warnings from auditors about financial management within Scotland's police service, which faces a funding gap of up to £200m in the coming years."

2017-02-15,Cyber centre to make UK 'hardest target',https://web.archive.org//web/20170215070453/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-38964996,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe Queen was shown how hackers could target the UK's electricity supply as she opened a centre to protect the nation from cyber attacks.The National Cyber Security Centre - part of intelligence agency GCHQ - started work in October as part of a £1.9bn five-year strategy.Staff in Victoria, central London, will be joined by experts from the private sector to help identify threats.NCSC chief Ciaran Martin said: ""We want to make the UK the hardest target"".The secondments to the centre by 100 private sector employees will be funded by their own companies.Announcing the initiative, Chancellor Philip Hammond said the ""best and the brightest in industry"" will help ""test and to challenge the government's thinking"" in cyber security.He added: ""Government cannot protect business and the general public from the risks of cyber-attack on its own. It has to be a team effort. It is only in this way that we can stay one step ahead of the scale and pace of the threat that we face.""There were 188 cyber attacks classed by the NCSC as Category Two or Three during the last three months. And even though the UK has not experienced a Category One attack - the highest level, an example of which would have been the theft of confidential details of millions of Americans from the Office of Personnel Management - there is no air of complacency at the NCSC's new headquarters.  Ciaran Martin, the centre's chief executive, told the BBC: ""We have had significant losses of personal data, significant intrusions by hostile state actors, significant reconnaissance against critical national infrastructure - and our job is to make sure we deal with it in the most effective way possible."" As well as protecting against and responding to high-end attacks on government and business, the NCSC also aims to protect the economy and wider society. The UK is one of the most digitally dependent economies, with the digital sector estimated to be worth over £118bn per year - which means the country has much to lose. It is not just a crippling cyber-attack on infrastructure that could turn out the lights which worries officials, but also a loss of confidence in the digital economy from consumers and businesses, as a result of criminals exploiting online vulnerabilities.  A sustained effort was required by government and private sector working together to make the UK the hardest possible target, officials say.Russia has been the focus of recent concern, following claims it used cyber-attacks to interfere with the recent US presidential election. ""I think there has been a significant change in the Russian approach to cyber-attacks and the willingness to carry it out, and clearly that's something we need to be prepared to deal with,"" Mr Martin said. French and German officials have warned of the possibility of interference in their upcoming elections, but the NCSC's head said there was no evidence that a significant attack or compromise had yet taken place against the UK democratic process.  ""There has been an identifiable trend in Russian attacks in the West, in terms of focusing on critical national industries and political and democratic processes,"" Mr Martin added.""And so it follows from that that we will look to be sure we are protecting those sectors in the UK as well as we possibly can."" The centre will be working on a voluntary basis with political parties and giving advice to high-profile individuals - including MPs - on how to protect their sensitive data.The UK is already targeting computers in other countries being used for cyber-attack, particularly if there is no possibility of prosecution or for co-operation with authorities where the hackers are based. ""In the most serious cases, we have lawful powers where we can go after the infrastructure of adversaries - the infrastructure that people use to attack us - and we would do that in some of the most serious cases several dozen times a year,"" Mr Martin said.In the past, UK cyber protection was largely situated within GCHQ in Cheltenham, which was criticised by businesses and others as overly secretive. The NCSC aims to be more public facing and accessible. It will also protect a far wider range of sectors, rather than just government and national security-related industries, like defence. GCHQ will still be the parent body for the NCSC, meaning it can draw on the intelligence agency's skills and capabilities. Sometimes, the intelligence arm of GCHQ spots compromised networks as it watches adversaries move across the internet. It was through this type of work that GCHQ spotted the compromise of the US Democratic Party's information by Russian hackers, which it then informed US authorities about.The NCSC is working on trial services to pro-actively discover vulnerabilities in public sector websites, help government departments better manage spoofing of their email, and take down tens of thousands of phishing sites affecting the UK.   ""We're actively working to reduce the harm caused by cyber-attacks against the UK and will use the government as a guinea pig for all the measures we want to see done by industry at national scale,"" says the NCSC technical director, Dr Ian Levy. He says results would be published openly to enhance collaboration. The centre will be publishing some of its code as open source, so that others can use the techniques. "

We looked forward to the country's eventual return because it was part of our very close knit family and our doors have always remained open,"" a spokesman said.Last week, the European Union promised The Gambia an aid package of nearly £65m ($81m) - almost three years after freezing its assistance to the West African nation.Mr Barrow, who was sworn in last month, has also said The Gambia will reverse its move to withdraw from the International Criminal Court (ICC).In a statement on Monday, the government said it had written to UN chief Antonio Guterres to inform him of its decision ""to discontinue the withdrawal notice"".A former Gambian information minister had referred to the court last year as ""an International Caucasian Court for the persecution and humiliation of people of colour, especially Africans"".The move is a blow to Africa's anti-ICC lobby - which includes South Africa, Namibia and Burundi.At the annual African Union summit held this month, leaders called for a mass walk-out from the ICC, but faced opposition from other countries, including Nigeria, Senegal and The Gambia. The Foreign Office said as well as holding talks with Mr Barrow, Mr Johnson would visit the UK-funded Medical Research Council and speak to Chevening scholars and workers and employers in the tourism industry.The West African state is a popular holiday destination for Britons. Thousands had to be evacuated last month because of security concerns when Mr Jammeh was refusing to hand over power after losing December's elections.Mr Barrow, whose swearing-in was held in neighbouring Senegal, is to be inaugurated as president in a ceremony at the national stadium on Saturday.Several heads of state are expected to attend. Local dignitaries may include former Vice-President Alhagie Saihou Sabally, who local media said had returned to the country on Monday after 22 years in exile.Mr Jammeh, who took power in coup in 1994, is now in exile in Equatorial Guinea after West African leaders deployed troops to The Gambia to ensure he left power. Mr Johnson will go on to Ghana for talks with President Nana Akufo-Addo on Wednesday.Referring to him and Mr Barrow, Mr Johnson said: ""Their elections highlight the continuing strengthening of democracy in West Africa."""
2017-02-15,Brexit 'risk' to environmental standards,https://web.archive.org//web/20170215070453/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38959996,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkUpholding environmental standards after Brexit will be hard, peers have said, warning of ""worrying complacency"" in government about the risks ahead.An enforcement system similar to that provided by EU regulators and courts is needed to maintain existing protections, a Lords EU committee said.The UK, it added, will need to find new ways to shape EU policies and remain an influential voice on climate change.Ministers insist that standards will be maintained and even improved.But they have also said that leaving the EU is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to get rid of red tape holding farmers and others back.Under a process known as the Great Repeal Bill, all existing EU laws - including 40 years' worth of environmental regulations and directives - will be converted into domestic law before the government decides which to keep and which to jettison.Peers said the process - which will take place in parallel to the official Brexit negotiations over the next two years - would be ""immensely complex"".Publishing an assessment of the impact of Brexit on environmental standards, the cross-party committee said the European Commission, the EU's executive branch, and the European Court of Justice had played a vital role in enforcing the ""patchwork quilt"" of EU laws and regulations over recent decades.Without such a backstop, it was worried standards risk being eroded.""The government seems to be worryingly complacent about the loss of this enforcement regime,"" the report claimed. ""Whether it is a question of migratory birds, managing our oceans or air pollution, the environment transcends political boundaries and the UK's environment and Europe's will remain inextricably linked,"" said its chair, Lib Dem peer Lord Teverson.""The bottom line is that if the UK fails to honour environmental law, it will end up in court...  We are not convinced that the government has yet found a way to deliver the continuity of environmental protection that we all want to achieve.""It said an independent enforcement mechanism would still be needed, underpinned by a system of judicial oversight, to ensure central government, businesses and households live up to their environmental obligations.Even if the UK left the single market, businesses would still have to comply with basic environmental obligations if they wanted to trade with the EU, it argued.The committee is pressing the government to clarify whether funding for scientific research and sustainable infrastructure currently available through the European Investment Bank will continue after the UK leaves the EU.It also suggested that after Brexit, the UK would have to align itself with other like-minded countries outside the EU to ensure it remained an advocate for global action to tackle the effects of climate change.""The UK has been a world leader but in leaving the EU, we lose our strongest allies,"" the report said.Environment Secretary Andrea Leadsom has said Brexit is a chance to do away with needless bureaucracy, such as rules on how many crops farmers must plant each year, while upholding environmental and animal welfare standards.Her department has launched a consultation on a 25-year plan for the environment, focused on developing policies ""tailored to the needs of the UK, our species and our habitats"", including wildlife protections and sensitive management of farmland.Responding to the report, a Defra spokesman said: ""Our ambition is to be the first generation to leave the environment in a better state than we found it.""We are committed to building on our long history of wildlife and environmental protection and securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU."""
2017-02-15,Firms 'using gig workers to avoid tax',https://web.archive.org//web/20170215070453/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-38963653,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe head of Theresa May's inquiry into the way millions of people work has said there is evidence businesses are using self-employment laws to avoid tax.Matthew Taylor told the BBC that he wanted to see a new standard of ""fair and decent"" work which the public and private sector could sign up to.He said that new flexible ways of working were very good for many businesses and people, but said a complicated tax system and lack of clarity on the law meant that employers and employees often clashed.Some were deliberately using so-called gig workers to avoid paying contributions to the Treasury, he said.What is the 'gig' economy?""There is no question - and Phillip Hammond said this in the Autumn Statement - that when self-employment rose that reduces the tax take to the Exchequer,"" said Mr Taylor, who is head of the Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce.""There are reasons why that might be a good thing in terms of how those people are working, but it is clear to a certain extent what is actually going on is, people are creating forms of work for themselves, or businesses are creating forms of work, to try to avoid tax.""I think what should drive businesses is efficiency, productivity, innovation - not trying to evade tax.""So, if we can make the system one where those incentives are less strong, then that would be an improvement.""His comments come on the day a report by the Trades Union Congress says the tax hit from the growth of ""insecure work"" could be as high as £4bn ($5bn) a year.The TUC said that represented nearly a quarter of the social care budget spent in England.The study claims that generally lower incomes for the self-employed and those on zero-hours contracts (which have been criticised for giving employees little job security) means that less tax is collected.""The real worry here is the growth in low paid self-employment,"" Frances O'Grady, the general secretary of the TUC, told me.""We see that both in terms of zero hours, and low paid self-employment, that people are much less likely to be paid as much as people in secure work.""Research from the Institute for Fiscal Studies revealed last week that a permanently employed person pays an effective rate of tax of 31% on their incomeThat falls to 22% for self-employed people, who pay lower levels of national insurance.Businesses also save as they make no national insurance contributions and can avoid maternity and holiday pay entitlements.Because self-employed people tend to be on lower incomes they also receive higher levels of benefits, another cost to the Treasury.The Chancellor has made it clear he is concerned about the issue and is likely to announce reforms to the tax system so that the treatment of permanent and self-employed workers is more equitable.The first announcement on any major policy changes could come as soon as the Budget on 8 March.Mr Taylor said that most people involved in new ways of working ""choose and like"" flexible jobs and zero hours, but some employees may face exploitation.""This is a very complicated system,"" he said.""And as we have seen with cases like Pimlico plumbers last week, or Uber a few weeks before, that the courts are making judgments which people find quite confusing.""How can we introduce greater clarity so people know what their rights are, so business people designing a business can design it in the right way?""It is clear to me the review I am leading on only makes sense if we as a country are committed to the idea of all work being fair and decent and [that] provides people with the opportunity for fulfilment and development.""We have been great as a country at creating jobs, but not enough of those jobs are good jobs that provide people with opportunities to grow and to develop.""I am hoping that the review will mark a turning point, a point at which as a country we say it is not just the quantity of jobs that matters it is also the quality.""Mr Taylor said there may not be a need for new legislation and that workers on boards was not always the best option for businesses seeking to involve employees in how the firm is run.The Prime Minister initially appeared to support worker representation on boards before later backing away from the proposal.""Generally I think carrot works a bit better than stick,"" Mr Taylor said.""The problem with stick, when it comes to employment and tax, is that when you wave one stick people find a way round it and then you have to wave another stick and then you've got sticks all over the place.""So if there are ways of persuading people to do the right thing by encouragement, by support, through engagement, then that is the route I would prefer to use."""
2017-02-15,No 'quick fix' to cut prison population,https://web.archive.org//web/20170215070453/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-38955348,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkPrison numbers cannot be cut with ""dangerous quick fix"" solutions, the justice secretary has said.Liz Truss said the overcrowding is down to more criminals serving time for violence and sex crimes.She called for early interventions and better reforms but not shorter sentences, after a BBC investigation revealed chaos at one jail.The Howard League said the problems uncovered were seen in ""almost every prison in the country"".The Ministry of Justice said it would investigate disclosures by the Panorama programme about HMP Northumberland, which included widespread drug use, a lack of control, door alarms that did not go off in one block and a hole in an internal security fence.The BBC's home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said Ms Truss' speech focused on tackling the ""appalling"" number of re-offenders but did not feature a major policy announcement or sweeping changes in direction. The key points of her speech were:The current rate of re-offending within a year of conviction is 25.3%.Speaking to the Centre for Social Justice, Ms Truss said: ""Reductions by cap or quota, or by sweeping sentencing cuts are not a magic bullet, they are a dangerous attempt at a quick fix.""The most recent figures put the population of inmates in England and Wales at 85,490 in 2016 - up from 50,962 on average in 1995.Put prisoner safety first, charities sayWhat is going wrong with the prison system?Ms Truss said more sex offenders were being sent to prison as sentence lengths ""better reflect the severity"" of crimes like domestic violence, rape and child abuse.She rejected calls by Labour officials to reduce the number of prisoners in England and Wales by half, warning that such a move would be ""reckless"" and ""endanger the public"".Ms Truss said courts needed to be given the right tools to intervene before prison was an option.""There can never be an excuse for committing crime but too often people end up in prison because our interventions to tackle problems like drug addiction or mental health issues don't work as well as they should,"" she added.""Community sentences are most effective when they tackle the problems that contribute to the offender's crime."" The justice secretary said the Prison and Courts Bill - due to be published this month - will ""enshrine in law that reforming offenders is a key purpose of prison and that the Secretary of State has a responsibility for delivering it"".""This will usher in the biggest reform of our prisons in a generation. It will transform our prisons from offender warehouses to disciplined and purposeful centres of reform,"" she added.After her speech, Ms Truss said she would be meeting with the family of Dean Saunders, who died in Chelmsford Prison after he was found electrocuted in his cell.Andrew Neilson, spokesman for the Howard League for Penal Reform, said the justice secretary needed to act to get prison numbers down quickly.""She wants to reduce prison numbers in a long-term way through tackling reoffending but she won't look at sentencing reform to actually try and get numbers down quickly,"" he told the BBC.""And I'm afraid that without that sentencing reform we are going to continue to have ministers making similar speeches bemoaning the violence and the deaths in prisons because we will not get a solution without doing something about prison numbers."""

2017-02-15,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20170215070453/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThis article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide to the UK's vote to leave the European Union. It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 52% to 48%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who resigned on the day after losing the referendum. Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she says she will respect the will of the people. She has said ""Brexit means Brexit"" but there is still a lot of debate about what that will mean in practice especially on the two key issues of how British firms do business in the European Union and what curbs are brought in on the rights of European Union nationals to live and work in the UK. She set out more details of her negotiating hopes in her key speech on Brexit.The UK economy appears to have weathered the initial shock of the Brexit vote, although the value of the pound remains near a 30-year low, but opinion is sharply divided over the long-term effects of leaving the EU. Some major firms such as Easyjet and John Lewis have pointed out that the slump in sterling has increased their costs. Britain also lost its top AAA credit rating, meaning the cost of government borrowing will be higher. But share prices have recovered from a dramatic slump in value, with both the FTSE 100 and the broader FTSE 250 index, which includes more British-based businesses, trading higher than before the referendum. The Bank of England cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - a record low and the first cut since 2009 - after the vote and there has not been the economic slump or recession that some had predicted. The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it has to invoke an agreement called Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May has said she intends to trigger this process by the end of March 2017, meaning the UK will be expected to have left by the summer of 2019, depending on the precise timetable agreed during the negotiations. The government will also enact a Great Repeal Bill which will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. It is expected to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove.After a court battle, the UK's Supreme Court ruled in January that Parliament must be consulted before Article 50 is invoked. This is why a two line Brexit bill is currently making its way through Parliament. MPs have approved it after Labour MPs were told to support it. It is now heading to the House of Lords to be debated and voted on.Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These men - dubbed the Three Brexiteers - will play a central role in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although it will be Mrs May, as prime minister, who will have the final say. David Cameron's government did not do any emergency planning for Brexit ahead of the referendum and Mrs May has rejected calls to say what her negotiating goals are.Once Article 50 has been triggered, the UK will have two years to negotiate its withdrawal. But no one really knows how the Brexit process will work - Article 50 was only created in late 2009 and it has never been used. Former Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, now Chancellor, wanted Britain to remain in the EU, and he has suggested it could take up to six years for the UK to complete exit negotiations. The terms of Britain's exit will have to be agreed by 27 national parliaments, a process which could take some years, he has argued. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. The UK will continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making.Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Following Theresa May's Brexit recent speech we now know that the UK is not intending to stay in the EU's single market. Although there has been speculation for months about the issue, it would have meant the UK staying under the auspices of the European Court of Justice and having to allow unlimited EU immigration, under freedom of movement rules.Both sides want trade to continue after Brexit with the UK seeking a positive outcome for those who wish to trade goods and services"" - such as those in the City of London and wanting a ""comprehensive free trade deal"" giving the UK ""the greatest possible access"" to the single market. Mrs May says she wants the UK to reach a new customs union deal with the EU. A customs union is where countries agree not to impose tariffs on each others' goods and have a common tariff on goods coming in from elsewhere. The UK is currently part of the EU customs union but that stops the UK being able to do its own trade deals with other countries. Reality Check: How could customs union work?These terms have increasingly been used as debate focused on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people in order to maintain access to the EU single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result.The government has declined to give a firm guarantee about the status of EU nationals currently living in the UK, saying this is not possible without a reciprocal pledge from other EU members about the millions of British nationals living on the continent. EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, will be be able to stay, the chief civil servant at the Home Office has said. The rights of other EU nationals would be subject to negotiations on Brexit and the ""will of Parliament"", he added.A lot depends on the kind of deal the UK agrees with the EU. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions on EU nationals, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.Again, it depends on whether the UK government decides to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages. Citizens' Advice has reminded people their rights have not changed yet and asked anyone to contact them if they think they have been discriminated against following the Leave vote.Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested EU migrants who come to the UK as Brexit nears may not be given the right to stay. He has said there might have to be a cut-off point if there was a ""surge"" in new arrivals.People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote. The day-to-day spending impact is likely to be more significant. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it to remain at least 10% below where it was on 23 June, in the long term. This means imported goods will consequently get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have already been seen and the issue was most notably illustrated by the dispute between Tesco and Marmite's makers about whether prices would be put up or not in the stores.The latest UK inflation figures, for January, showed the CPI inflation rate rising to 1.8%, its highest level for two and a half years, with signs of more cost pressures set to feed through in the months to come.Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration.She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations. As mentioned above, the key issue is whether other EU nations will grant the UK access to the single market, if that is what it wants, while at the same time being allowed to restrict the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK.Mrs May has said she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. It is currently running at 330,000 a year, of which 184,000 are EU citizens, and 188,000 are from outside the EU - the figures include a 39,000 outflow of UK citizens.It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Liberal Democrats - who have just a handful of MPs - have vowed to halt Brexit and keep Britain in the EU if they were to win the next general election.Some commentators, including former House of Commons clerk Lord Lisvane, have argued that a further referendum would be needed to ratify whatever deal the UK hammers out with the EU, but there are few signs political leaders view this as a viable option.Yes. Theresa May has appeared keen to avoid a vote on her negotiating stance, to avoid having to give away her priorities, but Theresa May has said there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. It is worth mentioning that any deal also has to be agreed by the European Parliament - with British MEPs getting a chance to vote on it there.  While there could be limitations on British nationals' ability to live and work in EU countries, it seems unlikely they would want to deter tourists. There are many countries outside the European Economic Area, which includes the 28 EU nations plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway, that British citizens can visit for up to 90 days without needing a visa and it is possible that such arrangements could be negotiated with European countries.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. In theory, the government could, if it wanted, decide to change the colour, which is currently standardised for EU countries, says the BBC's Europe correspondent, Chris Morris.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketNo nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it is ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faces being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. A second independence referendum for the country is now ""highly likely"", she has said, although not in 2017. She has said she wants Scotland to stay in the single market and said Mrs May's decision to rule out the UK staying in the single market ""undoubtedly"" brings the referendum closer.Before his resignation Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said the impact in Northern Ireland would be ""very profound"" and that the whole island of Ireland should now be able to vote on reunification. But, speaking while she was still Northern Ireland Secretary, Theresa Villiers ruled out the call from Sinn Féin for a border poll, saying the circumstances in which one would be called did not exist. The land border is likely to be a key part of the Brexit talks. Theresa May said a priority for her would be negotiating a deal with the EU which allowed a common travel area between the UK and the Republic of Ireland.During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest. But his successor Theresa May has said she will keep it in place, at least for the current Parliament, which is due to last until 2020.So far there has been a cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. There are yet to be signs that rising inflation have worried the Bank of England  enough to consider raising interest rates.  But if that happened it would make mortgages and loans more expensive to repay - but would be good news for savers.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.Eurotunnel boss Jacques Gounon said last November the reintroduction of duty-free would be ""an incredible boost for my business"" but he later said  that remark had been ""light-hearted"". Erik Juul-Mortensen, president of the Tax Free World Association (TFWA) said after the referendum vote ""it is not possible to predict how Brexit will affect the duty free and travel retail industry, and it is wiser not to make assumptions about exactly what the impact will be.""  They are at the moment but no-one knows the longer term prospects for definite. The EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - is not an EU initiative. It was negotiated between countries within a group known as the European Economic Area, often simply referred to as the single market (plus Switzerland, which confusingly is not a member of the EEA, but has agreed access to the single market). Therefore, the future of Britons' EHIC cover could depend on whether the UK decided to sever ties with the EEA.Probably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report. In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two-thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.However, the UK government is committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, the UK government is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR. However, the EU has its own European Court of Justice, whose decisions are binding on EU institutions and member states.Its rulings have sometimes caused controversy in Britain and supporters of a Brexit have called for immediate legislation to curb its powers. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also cited sovereignty and democracy, and they wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Four of the biggest US banks have committed to helping maintain the City's position. But HSBC will move up to 1,000 jobs to Paris, the BBC understands. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Pest control firm Rentokil Initial says it could make £15m extra this year thanks to a weaker currency.Others are less optimistic. Hilary Jones, a director at UK cosmetics firm Lush said the company was ""terrified"" about the economic impact. She added that while the firm's Dorset factory would continue to produce goods for the UK market, products for the European market may be made at its new plant in Germany.Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After the Leave vote, the government will probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""As with most elements of the UK economy, not enough solid data has been published yet to accurately conclude the Brexit effect on house prices. Industry figures have pointed to ""uncertainty"" among buyers and sellers that could potentially change the housing market.So far, the most significant research has come from the respected Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which has published the conclusions of a survey of its members. This primarily records sentiment among surveyors.It found that house prices are expected to fall across the UK in the three months after the referendum vote. However, the dip in prices is only expected to persist over the 12 months from June in London and East Anglia, surveyors predict.House prices were already slowing in central London, owing to the fall-out from changes to stamp duty rules in April.Separate figures from property portal Rightmove suggested the average asking price of houses coming on to the market in England and Wales fell by 0.9%, or £2,647, in July compared with June. It said that agents had reported very few sales had fallen through as a result of the vote.Many potential first-time buyers would welcome a fall in house prices, with ownership among the young falling owing to affordability concerns. Investors in property, or those who have paid off a mortgage and hope to leave homes as inheritance would be unhappy with a long-term reduction in value.  Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law following the decision to leave the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" will not necessarily disappear overnight - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU means the UK will not be part of TTIP. It will have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Former Labour health secretary Lord Owen has said that because of TTIP (see answer above) the only way to protect the NHS from further privatisation was to get out of the EU."

2017-02-15,Race to reform,https://web.archive.org//web/20170215070453/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-38970265,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThere is a theory in politics that times of upheaval and uncertainty present opportunities as well as problems.It's best summed up in the saying that you should never let a good crisis go to waste - an aphorism so seductive that it has been attributed to all the usual historical suspects, from Machiavelli to Winston Churchill.It is perhaps in this spirit that the European Parliament has been debating how the EU is going to work in future, in the looming shadow of Brexit. The UK's vote to leave the EU, last June, came as a seismic shock to most MEPs. And many are quite open in their view that it amounts to a self-destructive decision by the British to uncouple themselves from one of modern history's primary drivers of peace and prosperity.British Eurosceptics of course would cast the Brexit vote in an entirely different light, and now foresee a future in which the UK will be free to make its fortune - and make its own new global trading relationships - unfettered from the dead hand of stifling Brussels bureaucracy.It will be years of course - perhaps many years - before we know who is on the right side of that debate.But one consequence of Brexit is already with us - the EU is now free to debate how it might work in the future without any input from the UK.In theory that should leave Europe's federalists freer to dream than they have been in the past. Britain's voice has generally been raised to question the wisdom and value of further integration that would give EU institutions greater powers at the expense of individual national governments. You would expect such dreams to be articulated best by Guy Verhofstadt - the former prime minister of Belgium, who now leads the liberal bloc in the European Parliament and who will represent that body in Brexit negotiations.In the debate on future reform Mr Verhofstadt said: ""The union is in crisis. The European Union doesn't have much friends: not at home, not abroad. ""The Union does not deliver anymore. Rather than to talk about an 'ever closer union', we have a union of 'too little, too late'. ""That's why people are angry: they see all these European institutions, all these summits, all these empty words, but they don't see enough results.""Mr Verhofstadt has a long list of suggested fixes for this continental malaise, including reducing or ending the right of individual members to opt out of collective decisions - something no British government would ever have countenanced. He has other ideas for how the EU should respond to Brexit too - including moving out of London the headquarters of two EU agencies: the European Banking Authority and the European Medicines Agency.But for now, at least, it seems radical visions for reform will be quietly kicked into touch.The vice-president of the EU Commission, Frans Timmermans, politely welcomed the display of ""vision"" in the proposals, but noted that most of the suggestions would require EU treaty change. He said simply: ""We have to acknowledge that treaty change is not on the top of the political agenda now, in member states in particular.""There are plenty of true believers in the European project who would see in the Verhofstadt proposals the start of a kind of counter-revolution against events which have dismayed them - including Brexit, the US election of Donald Trump and the strong opinion poll showing of insurgent parties in a number of European countries.Populist challenge brings Europe to crossroadsBrexit: All you need to knowBut for now a more cautious and pragmatic approach will prevail - partly because there is a general sense in Strasbourg and Brussels that the European institutions will have enough on their plates negotiating Brexit, without kicking off a parallel process of structural reform which would also take years.That takes us back to the idea that every crisis is an opportunity that shouldn't go to waste.There are, no doubt, those in Strasbourg who take that view - but it seems for the moment they are outweighed by those who feel that when you find yourself in the middle of a crisis - as they would see Brexit - the smartest course of action is to fix the crisis first and worry about the future later."
2017-02-15,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20170215070453/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-38957903,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe claim: Pensioners are on average £20 a week better off than working-age people.Reality Check verdict: The calculation made by the Resolution Foundation is for household income after housing costs. Before housing costs are taken into account, working-age households still have higher incomes than pensioner households.News that pensioner households are now better off than working-age families was widely reported on Monday.There have been reports for some time that incomes for pensioners have been growing faster than those for working-age people, largely as a result of pensions being protected by the triple-lock, while many working-age benefits have been frozen.The triple-lock guarantees that pensions rise by the same as average earnings, the consumer price index, or 2.5%, whichever is the highest.But the report from the Resolution Foundation was the first suggestion that the retired had actually overtaken the working-age group.The figures referred to the ""typical pensioner household"", by which it meant the median, which is the household for which half of pensioner households have higher income and half of them have lower incomes.In this case, a pensioner household is one in which at least one member is of pension age or older (65 for men, 64 for women) whether or not that person is working. There can also be working people in a pensioner household.But the important factor that has been mentioned little in the coverage is that the measure of income that the Resolution Foundation is using is one for income after housing costs have been paid. Taking income after housing costs makes a huge difference because pensioner households are more likely to own their own homes and to have relatively small or paid-off mortgages.The report says, for example, that 70% of the silent generation (born 1926-45) own their homes outright, while just over 40% of the baby boomers (1946-65) own theirs, with another 30% still having mortgages to pay.    The median income for both working-age and pensioner households is just over £20,000 a year, so housing costs would make a big difference.Also, the figures do not take account of people in care homes, which would be expected to increase housing costs for those of pension age.The Resolution Foundation confirms in the report that before housing costs are paid, the median working-age household still has a higher income than the median pensioner household.

2017-02-15,More than poppycock?,https://web.archive.org//web/20170215070453/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38950597,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkCould Jeremy Corbyn be replaced as Labour leader? And if so when? Those whispered questions have been echoing between Labour MPs and party apparatchiks at Westminster for weeks, for months. But today the guessing game has risen to a new pitch.In BBC interviews, we have been given answers of a sort by two of the most prominent members of the shadow cabinet.Yes, the Labour leader could be replaced. And the change could take place at the next election, ""if and when"" Mr Corbyn decides he has had enough.This time, the helpful guidance was not contained in any unattributed, anonymous briefing from a ""senior MP"" or ""party source"", who may or may not be keen to hasten Mr Corbyn on his way. They were the words of the party's newly appointed election co-ordinator in the shadow cabinet, Ian Lavery.In an interview with me for BBC Radio 5 live's Pienaar's Politics, I asked Mr Lavery if a report in the Sunday Times newspaper was true - that the party had conducted focus group research to gauge the potential appeal of two shadow cabinet colleagues, Rebecca Long-Bailey and Angela Raynor, as potential future leadership candidates.His denial was as emphatic as it was unsurprising. It was, he said, ""political poppycock.""""I think they are fantastic candidates. We have got lots of quality in the Labour Party and it's not just the two who have been mentioned,"" he added.More interesting was what he said next. ""There's plenty of leaders to pick from, if and when Jeremy decides, of his own volition, that it's not for him at the election."" He concluded, again helpfully: ""That isn't the case at this point in time.""So, in the space of one brief moment, the man now appointed to guide Labour through what could become a torrid series of electoral tests has volunteered that, in his judgement, Mr Corbyn may conceivably decide to pass on the leadership ""at the election"". And that there had been no such decision on Mr Corbyn's part ""at this point in time"". All of which can only crank up the volume of whispered speculation.Against this background, the verdict of Tom Watson, Labour's deputy Labour leader, in his interview with Andrew Marr, perhaps becomes a little more intriguing. He told Marr the party ""has got the leadership settled for this Parliament"".As for the mood in the party, much depends on the coming Parliamentary by-elections in the once supposedly ""safe"" constituencies of Stoke-on-Trent Central and Copeland in Cumbria.The new election co-ordinator, who replaced Jon Trickett amid a certain unease at the state of Labour's readiness for the fights ahead, was upbeat. Upbeat, at least up to a point. ""If you look at them separately, they are both relatively positive at this moment in time, despite what he polls might say, despite what individuals might say,"" he said. It was not the most ringingly confident assessment I can remember from an election strategist.If Labour loses one or both of these seats, expect the present simmering unease in the party to approach boiling point once again."
2017-02-15,Mark D'Arcy,https://web.archive.org//web/20170215070453/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-parliaments-38929871,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkBye, Bye, Bercow? I don't think so. The coverage of one MP's Early Day Motion (EDM) of no confidence in the Speaker, in the wake of his comments about President Trump, is massively over-egged. First, it's an EDM. They are a form of parliamentary graffiti - a way of expressing an opinion, and nestling amongst the 946 EDMs on such subjects as the Queen's sapphire jubilee, diplomatic relations with Armenia, the Battle of Cable St and organised dog fighting, it has so far attracted a single signature - although that might change when MPs return from their holidays. But the more important point about EDMs is that some special parliamentary acrobatics are needed for them to be debated on the floor of the Commons. The government could provide the time, but it won't. An opposition party could give up some of its allocated time, but they won't. The Backbench Business Committee, which controls its own block of Commons time, could allocate a slot - but it almost certainly won't.So no debate. But what if a large number of MPs do, eventually, sign it? Will a shamed Speaker Bercow retire to his state dining room with a bottle of his own-brand whisky and a loaded revolver? I strongly doubt it. This Speaker saw off a coup attempt on the last day of the 2010 Parliament, when the coalition whips attempted to change the rules on Speaker elections as a precursor to an attempt to unseat him after the general election. That vote was effectively a direct attack on the Speaker - and was supported by 202 MPs. Yet Speaker Bercow did not resign. Like another Marmite politician, he's a fighter, not a quitter. And no-one should make the mistake of assuming he is universally loathed by Tory MPs. The Bercow phenomenon is a complex thing. On the one hand, he's a hardline parliamentary moderniser. On a cosmetic level, he has ditched the grand gold-embroidered robes worn by his predecessors, and most recently, presided over the decision to abandon the court dress worn by the Commons Clerks. But more importantly, he has opened up the procedure of the House, with historically important results.A few months back I wrote about how his rulings provided the parliamentary openings that led to pro-Brexit MPs cornering David Cameron into conceding the EU referendum. But he has also allowed 353 Urgent Questions, putting ministers on the spot on topical issues, so that the Commons is visible on the TV news, debating the issues of the moment. In the 21st Century that is essential. MPs also appreciate his brisk conduct of question times, giving many more their moment in the Parliamentary limelight.But then there's the other side of the coin. His put-downs can be brutal, and Tory MPs believe he targets them more often than the opposition - although the Lib Dems, still smarting from the duffing up of their leader, Tim Farron, at PMQs the other week, might argue that they get swatted too. Where other Speakers might have poured on a little honey ""the Right Hon Gentleman who is a distinguished parliamentarian, should know better…"", Bercow's repartee - like his admonition to Tory Tim Loughton ""the children's minister should stop acting like a child"" - has not been forgotten or forgiven by its targets. His stand-up shouting match with the then government Chief Whip, Patrick McLoughlin, on the floor of the Commons, may be the most spectacular example of a loss of temper, but it's not the only one. To quote Kipling, the burnt Speaker's bandaged finger goes wabbling back to the fire. But there are plenty of reasons why I expect him to survive. First there is no Commons majority to remove him. Support for the Speaker may be the love that dare not speak its name in the Conservative 1922 Committee, but there is a solid phalanx of Bercow-supporting Tories out there. As one senior member of this elusive group put it, ""with this Speaker, you have to take the rough with the smooth"". They believe his failings are a price worth paying for a Speaker who they believe facilitates tough scrutiny of the government.Second, the government has learned the lesson of its attempt to remove him on 26 March 2015, and doesn't want to place its dabs on the dagger this time. And without a government whipping operation behind it, any direct attempt to topple the Speaker is doomed.Third, MPs want to protect the Office. This is a more subtle point. If the Speaker is to be dethroned, his successor will feel vulnerable from day one. They will be less willing to offend, not just ministers, but pretty much anyone. And that means the rights of individual MPs and backbench groupings like the pre-referendum Brexiteers to make life difficult, may be less diligently enforced. This argument convinces a lot of older hands who are not obvious Bercow backers on other grounds.Fourth, he's going anyway. Perhaps later in this Parliament than some may hope, but he's been in the Chair since 2009, and that's a pretty long spell. So why mount a putsch when success is not guaranteed and there's a price to be paid?So when the Bercow era does end, it will be at a time of his choosing."
2017-02-15,Peering ahead,https://web.archive.org//web/20170215070453/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38918526,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkSharpen your pencils. Now Theresa May has her prize from the Commons, getting the Article 50 bill (she never wanted) through with no major changes, it makes its way to the red and gold end of the Palace of Westminster, to the Lords.The first debate is set for 20 February. More than 140 Peers have already put their names down to speak. But at that stage there probably won't be a vote. A week later the thornier more detailed committee stage begins. Then the last certain stage, the third reading and report is scheduled for 7 March. If it all goes according to the government's plan, which sources say is ""hugely unpredictable"", it would allow Theresa May to stick to her timetable and push the button for exit talks to start the next week, once the Bill has been rubber-stamped by the other Palace. (It's daft in this business to make too many predictions, but I'd put a fiver on that happening on Wednesday 15 March.)The government will have a bumpier ride in the Lords after a grumpy process in the Commons. The Lords is dramatically different because the government most certainly does not have a majority among peers. And, it is the Lords' express purpose to scrutinise and if needed, improve draft laws before sending them back along the corridor to the Commons.Overnight a government source suggested that the Lords had better jolly well let the Brexit bill go through, or else. Despite the sabre-rattling though, the atmosphere in the Lords is less febrile than that language might suggest.Downing Street this morning tried to dampen down the aggressive briefing. And one source in the Lords described the threat as ""total BS"" - I'll leave you to work that out.The main opposition leader, Baroness Smith, has made it plain on several occasions that although the Lords may try to tweak the Bill, Labour, broadly, has no intention of trying to block it. Her modus operandi is to ""hold to account, not hold to ransom"".The Liberal Democrats are more intent on making changes in the Lords, for it is there they can wield power, rather than in the Commons. But unless they have the support of Labour too, there is a limit to how much trouble they can cause.The chatter suggests the Lords will push for concessions from the government over the rights of EU citizens to stay here, reporting the progress of negotiations regularly to Parliament and maybe on a final ""meaningful vote"" for both Houses on the deal.It will be up to the government to decide whether to tweak the bill slightly as they did in the Commons or risk some defeats. Insiders predict it is likely the Lords may end up sending back the bill to the Commons once, as ""ping pong"" to force the government to make a change or two. But even senior Lib Dem sources don't expect hostile stand-offs for weeks on end. The Lords will make their voices heard, there is no question about that and the Article 50 bill could run into trouble. It would be wrong to suggest that ministers don't anticipate a tricky time. But today at least, whatever the sabre-rattling from some parts of government, this historic piece of legislation looks likely to be the subject of a few skirmishes in the Lords, rather than an apocalyptic battle.

2017-02-15,Ward-by ward,https://web.archive.org//web/20170215070453/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38762034,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe BBC has obtained a more localised breakdown of votes from nearly half of the local authorities which counted EU referendum ballots last June.This information provides much greater depth and detail in explaining the pattern of how the UK voted. The key findings are:A statistical analysis of the data obtained for over a thousand individual local government wards confirms how the strength of the local Leave vote was strongly associated with lower educational qualifications.Wards where the population had fewer qualifications tended to have a higher Leave vote, as shown in the chart. If the proportion of the local electorate with a degree or similar qualification was one percentage point lower, then on average the leave vote was higher by nearly one percentage point.Using ward-level data means we can compare voting figures in this way to the local demographic information collected in the 2011 census. Of the main census statistics, this is the one with the greatest association with how people voted. In statistical terms the level of educational qualifications explains about two-thirds of the variation in the results between different wards. The correlation is strong, whether based on assessing graduate and equivalent qualifications or lower-level ones. This ward-by-ward analysis covers 1,070 individual wards in England and Wales whose boundaries had not changed since the 2011 census, about one in nine of the UK's wards. We had very little ward-level data from Scotland, and none from Northern Ireland.It should be noted, however, that many ward counts also included some postal votes from across the counting area, and therefore some variation between wards will have been masked by the random allocation of postal votes for counting. This makes the results less accurate geographically, but we can still use the information to explore broad national and local patterns.  Adding age as a second factor significantly helps to further explain voting patterns. Older populations were more likely to vote Leave. Education and age combined account for nearly 80% of the voting variation between wards. Ethnicity is a smaller factor, but one which also contributed to the results. Adding that in means that now 83% of the variation in the vote between wards is explained. White populations were generally more pro-Leave, and ethnic minorities less so.  However, there were some interesting differences between London and elsewhere.The ethnic dimension is particularly interesting when examining the outliers on the graph that compares the Leave vote to levels of education.There are numerous wards towards the bottom left of the graph where electorates with lower educational qualifications nevertheless produced low Leave and high Remain votes. This is where the link between low qualifications and Leave voting breaks down. It turns out that these exceptional wards have high ethnic minority populations, particularly in Birmingham and Haringey in north London. In contrast, there are virtually no dramatic outliers on the other side of the line, where comparatively highly educated populations voted Leave. Only one point on the graph stands out - this is Osterley and Spring Grove in Hounslow, west London, a mainly ethnic minority ward which had a Leave vote of 63%. While this figure does include some postal votes, they are not nearly enough to explain away this unusual outcome.In fact, in Ealing and Hounslow, west London boroughs with many voters of Asian origin, the ethnic correlation was in the other direction to the national picture: a higher number of Asian voters was associated with a higher Leave vote.This powerful link to educational attainment could stem from the lower qualified tending to feel less confident about their prospects and ability to compete for work in a competitive globalised economy with high levels of migration. On the other hand some commentators see it as primarily reflecting a ""culture war"" or ""values conflict"", rather than issues of economics and inequality. Research shows that non-graduates tend to take less liberal positions than graduates on a range of social issues from immigration and multi-culturalism to the death penalty.   The former campaign director of Vote Leave, Dominic Cummings, argues that the better educated are more prone to holding irrational political opinions because they are more driven by fashion and a group mentality. Of course this assessment does not imply that Leave voters were almost all poorly educated and old, and Remain voters well educated and young. The Leave side obviously attracted support from many middle class professionals, graduates and younger people. Otherwise it couldn't have won. While there was undoubtedly a lot of voting which cut across these criteria, the point of this analysis is to explore how different social groups most probably voted - and it is clear that education, age and ethnicity were crucial influences.  After these three key factors are taken into account, adding in further demographic measures from the census does little to increase the explanation of UK-wide voting patterns. However, this does not reflect the distinctively more pro-Remain voting in Scotland, since we are short of Scottish data at this geographical level. It is clear as well that in a few specific locations high student numbers were also very relevant. To a certain extent, using the level of educational qualifications as a measure combines both class and age factors, with working class and older adults both tending to be less well qualified.But the association between education and the voting results is stronger than the association between social or occupational class and the results. This is still true after taking the age of the local population into account.This suggests that voters with lower qualifications were more likely to back Leave than the better qualified, even when they were in the same social or occupational class.The existence of a significant connection between Leave voting and lower educational qualifications had already been suggested by analysis of the published referendum results from the official counting areas.The data we have obtained strengthens this conclusion, because voting patterns can now be compared to social statistics from the 2011 census at a much more detailed geographical level than by the earlier studies. The BBC analysis is also consistent with opinion polling (for example, from Lord Ashcroft, Ipsos Mori and YouGov) that tried to identify the characteristics of Leave and Remain voters.  The data we have collected can be used to illustrate the sort of places where the Leave and Remain camps did particularly well: it is hard to imagine a more glaring social contrast than that between the deprived, poorly educated housing estates of Brambles and Thorntree in Middlesbrough, and the privileged elite colleges of Market ward in central Cambridge. It is important to bear in mind, however, that most of the voting figures mentioned below also include some postal votes, so they should be treated as approximate rather than precise.  It is also important to note that the examples are limited to the places for which we were able to obtain localised information, which was only a minority of areas. The rest of the country may well contain even starker instances.Of the 1,283 individual wards for which we have data, the highest Leave vote was 82.5% in Brambles and Thorntree, a section of east Middlesbrough with many social problems. Ward boundaries have changed since the 2011 census, but in that survey the Thorntree part of the area had the lowest proportion of people with a degree or similar qualification of anywhere in England and Wales, at only 5%. And according to Middlesbrough council, the figure for the current Brambles and Thorntree ward is even lower, at just 4%. Second highest was 80.3% in Waterlees Village, a poor locality within Wisbech, Cambridgeshire. This area has seen a major influx of East European migrants who have been doing low-paid work in nearby food processing factories and farms, with tensions between them and British residents. Other wards with available data which had the strongest Leave votes were congregated in Middlesbrough, Canvey Island in Essex, Skegness in coastal Lincolnshire, and Havering in east London.The highest Remain vote was 87.8% in Market ward in central Cambridge, an area with numerous colleges and a high student population, in a city which was strongly pro-Remain.This was followed by Ashley ward  (85.6%) in central Bristol, a district featuring ethnic diversity, gentrification and alternative culture.Next highest was Northumberland Park (85.0%) in Haringey, north London, which has a substantial black population. Other wards with available data which had the strongest Remain votes were generally located in Cambridge, Bristol and the multi-ethnic London boroughs of Haringey and Lambeth. The count for Ashburton in Croydon, south London, split 50-50 exactly, with both Leave and Remain getting 3,885 votes, but that did include some postal ballots.As for being nearest to the overall result, the combined count of Tulketh and University, neighbouring wards near the centre of Preston, was 51.92% for leave, very close to the UK wide figure of 51.89%. The individual ward of Barnwood in Gloucester had Leave at 51.94%. Both figures however contain some postal votes.Given that a few councils provided even more detailed data down to the level of polling districts, it is possible to identify some very small localities that were nicely representative of the national picture. The 527 voters in the neighbouring districts of Kirk Langley and Mackworth in Amber Valley in Derbyshire, whose two ballot boxes were counted together, produced a leave proportion of 51.99%. And this figure is not contaminated by any postal votes.So journalists (or anyone else for that matter) who seek a microcosm of the UK should perhaps visit the Mundy Arms pub in Mackworth, the location for that district's polling station.Similarly, the 427 voters in the combined neighbouring polling districts of Chiddingstone Hoath and Hever Four Elms to the south of Sevenoaks in Kent delivered a leave vote of 51.6% (again, without any postal votes).The data obtained points to 269 areas of various sizes (wards, clusters of wards or constituencies) which had a different Leave/Remain outcome compared to the official counting area of which they were part.This consists of 150 areas which backed Remain but were part of Leave-voting counting areas; and 119 in the other direction. The detailed information therefore gives us an understanding of how the electorate voted which is more variegated than the officially published results.Every one of Scotland's 32 counting areas came down on the Remain side. Yet, despite the fact that most Scottish councils did not give us much detailed information, we can nevertheless identify a few smaller parts of the country which actually backed Leave.A cluster of six wards in the Banff and Buchan area in north Aberdeenshire had a strong Leave majority of 61%. There is much local discontent within the fishing industry of this coastal district about the EU's common fisheries policy.An Taobh Siar agus Nis, a ward at the northern end of the Isle of Lewis in Na h-Eileanan an Iar (Western Isles), also voted Leave, if very narrowly. And at a smaller geographical level, in Shetland the 567 voters in the combined polling districts of Whalsay and South Unst had an extremely high Leave vote of 81%. The island of Whalsay is a fishing community, where EU rules have been controversial and in 2012 numerous skippers were heavily fined for major breaches of fishing quotas.Ealing and Hounslow are neighbouring multi-ethnic boroughs in the west of London with large Asian populations, where - in contrast to the national picture - non-white ethnicity was associated with voting Leave, particularly in Ealing. Both boroughs shared a varied internal pattern of prosperous largely white areas voting strongly Remain, poorer largely white areas preferring Leave, and the Asian areas tending to be more evenly split.Ealing voted 60% Remain, with Southfield ward hitting 76%, but in contrast the Southall wards which are over 90% ethnic minority were close to 50-50.In Hounslow the richer wards in Chiswick in the east of the area voted heavily Remain (73%), but the poorer largely white wards at the opposite western end in Feltham and Bedfont voted Leave (64-66%). Osterley and Spring Grove was also 63% Leave, the highest Leave vote in any individual ward in the UK with a non-white majority for which we have data. The south London borough of Bromley narrowly voted Remain. Those parts which did not do so by a significant margin were the Cray Valley wards, largely poor white working class areas; and Biggin Hill and Darwin wards, locations to the south which contain more open countryside and lie outside the built-up commuter belt. In Croydon in south London, places which voted Leave by substantial amounts were New Addington and Fieldway, neighbouring wards with large council estates. Beyond the areas with the strongest backing for Leave and Remain, examining the detailed breakdown of votes in various places gives greater insight into the pattern of support for the two sides - as can be seen from the following examples.In several places (for example, Birmingham, Bristol, Nottingham, Portsmouth) there was a strong contrast between the Leave-voting populations of large, rundown, predominantly white, housing estates in the urban periphery, versus Remain-voting populations in inner city areas with large numbers of ethnic minorities and sometimes students.Birmingham had several wards with large Remain votes, although the city as a whole narrowly voted Leave.  These pro-Remain wards tended to be the more highly educated, better off localities, or minority ethnic areas which strongly backed Remain despite low levels of educational qualifications. I have written about this before. In Blackburn with Darwen, Bastwell ward had the highest Remain vote at 65%, compared to only 44% in the area as a whole. This ward has an ethnic minority proportion of over 90%. Other Blackburn wards which voted Remain were also ones with high minority populations.Bradford voted to Leave (54%), but the area included some starkly contrasting places which went over 60% Remain: the prosperous, genteel, spa town of Ilkley, and strongly ethnic minority wards in the city, such as Manningham and Toller.Bristol voted strongly Remain on the whole (62%), but there were some striking exceptions, particularly the large, deprived, mainly white estates to the south of the city. Hartcliffe and Withywood backed Leave at 67%. Similar neighbouring wards (Hengrove and Whitchurch Park, Filwood, Bishopsworth and Stockwood) also voted Leave, as did the more industrial area of Avonmouth and Lawrence Weston to the north west of the city.As a county Cornwall voted to Leave. But one of its six parliamentary constituencies, Truro and Falmouth, voted 53% to Remain, possibly linked to a significant student population.In Lincoln, which voted 57% to Leave, Carholme ward stands out as very different - it voted 63% to Remain. This ward includes Lincoln University, and 43% of the residents are students Middlesbrough voted 65% to Leave. As already noted, it had several wards with extremely high leave votes of over 75%. But one ward, Linthorpe, voted very narrowly to Remain - a comparatively well-to-do inner suburb which includes an art college; and another ward, Central, which contains Teesside University, nearly did. Mole Valley in Surrey exhibited a dramatic contrast between two neighbouring districts with very different demographics and housing. The highest Remain vote was in the very prosperous location of Dorking South, which voted 63% Remain, but the neighbouring ward of Holmwoods, dominated by large estates on the edge of the town of Dorking, voted 57% Leave, the area's highest Leave vote. Nottingham voted narrowly to Leave, but the inner city ward of Radford and Park voted 68% Remain. This has both a comparatively high proportion of ethnic minorities and considerable numbers of students from two nearby universities. There was a lot of variation within the area. Bulwell - a market town to the north of the city with many social problems - voted 69% Leave  There was also a high Leave vote in the housing estate locations of the Clifton wards in the south of Nottingham.Oldham voted to Leave at 61%, but Werneth, the city ward with the highest ethnic minority population, voted Remain (57%). Other wards with high minority populations also voted Remain.In Oxford the cluster of polling districts which included Blackbird Leys and other deprived estates on the southern edge of the city voted to Leave at 51%. In contrast the central areas containing colleges, university buildings and student accommodation voted to Remain at over 80%.Plymouth voted 60% Leave, but Drake ward which includes the university had the city's highest Remain vote at 56%. Portsmouth was another place with wide variation. Paulsgrove ward, with its large estate on the edge of the city, had the highest Leave vote at 70%, whereas at the other end of the spectrum Central Southsea, an inner city ward and student area, voted 57% Remain.Rochdale voted 60% Leave. The place which bucked this trend by voting 59% Remain, Milkstone and Deeplish, was the most predominantly ethnic minority ward. Central Rochdale had the second highest Remain vote and is the other ward that is mainly not white. Walsall voted strongly Leave (68%). The only ward which voted Remain, Paddock, is both a comparatively prosperous and multi-ethnic locality.A few councils released their data at remarkably localised levels, down even to individual polling districts (ie ballot boxes) in the case of Blackburn with Darwen and Bracknell Forest, or clusters of two/three/four districts, in the case of Amber Valley, Brentwood, Sevenoaks, Shetland, South Oxfordshire, and Tewkesbury.This provides very local and specific data, in some cases just for neighbourhoods of hundreds of voters.At its most detailed this reveals that the 110 people who cast their votes in the ballot box at St. Alban's Primary School in central Blackburn split 56-52 in favour of Remain, with two spoilt papers.It also discloses stark contrasts in some neighbouring locations. The 953 people who voted at Little Harwood community centre in north Blackburn had a Leave vote of only 31%, while the 336 electors who voted in the neighbouring ballot box at Roe Lee Park primary school produced a Leave percentage over twice as high, at 64%.The very detailed data we obtained also provides some rare evidence on the views of postal compared to non-postal voters. Campaign strategists have often deliberated on whether the two groups vote differently and should be given separate targeted messages.Most places mixed boxes of postal and non-postal votes for counting, so generally it's not possible to draw comparative conclusions. However there were a few exceptions which recorded them separately, or included a very small number of non-postal votes with the postals.These figures indicate that postal voters were narrowly less likely to back Leave than voters in polling stations. Data covering five counting areas with about 260,000 votes shows that in these places the roughly one in five electors who voted by post backed Leave at 55.4%, one percentage point lower than the local non-postal support for Leave of 56.4%.The counting areas involved are Amber Valley, East Cambridgeshire, Gwynedd, Hyndburn and North Warwickshire.Since the referendum the BBC has been trying to get the most detailed, localised voting data we could from each of the counting areas.  This was a major data collection exercise carried out by my colleague George Greenwood. We managed to obtain voting figures broken down into smaller geographical units for 178 of the 399 referendum counting areas (380 councils in England, Wales and Scotland, with a separate tally in Gibraltar, while in Northern Ireland results were issued for the 18 constituencies). This varied between data for individual local government wards, wards grouped into clusters, and constituency level data. In a few cases the results supplied were even more localised than ward level. Overall the extra data covers a wide range of different areas and kinds of councils across the UK. Electoral returning officers are not covered by the Freedom of Information Act, so releasing the information was up to the discretion of councils. While some were very willing, in other cases it required a lot of persistence and persuasion. Some councils could not supply any detailed data because they mixed all ballot boxes prior to counting; some did possess more local figures but simply refused to disclose them to us. Others did provide data, but the combinations in which ballot boxes were mixed before counting were too complex to fit ward boundaries neatly.A few places such as Birmingham released their ward by ward data following the referendum on their own initiative, but in most cases the information had to be obtained by us requesting it directly, and sometimes repeatedly, from the authority."

2017-02-15,Meet the EU's chief Brexit negotiator,https://web.archive.org//web/20170215070453/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37542204,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe British papers love a French villain at the heart of the EU.Is Michel Barnier about to succeed Jacques Delors as the object of their affection? The veteran Gaullist already has form.When he was Commissioner for the Internal Market and Financial Services, Mr Barnier was dubbed ""the most dangerous man in Europe"" after taking on the banking sector and championing a cap on bankers' bonuses. But while he alarmed some in the City, and will probably do so again, he also won grudging respect as a tough but even-handed negotiator.He will need all those skills and more in his new role - chief Brexit negotiator at the European Commission. And having moved seamlessly between big jobs in Paris and Brussels - French foreign minister, Commissioner, MEP - he looks well prepared. ""Don't ask me to tell you what will be at the end of the road, we haven't begun to walk yet,"" he told a conference in Brussels last month. Mr Barnier will stick closely to the official EU position of ""no negotiation without notification"" - waiting for the UK to trigger Article 50 to start the formal process of withdrawal. But he's clearly eager to get going.""I am waiting to begin,"" he said. ""I will be ready tomorrow to negotiate, frankly speaking.""And he will bring with him an instinctive pro-European agenda, and a deep knowledge of the workings of the single market.His deputy as chief Brexit negotiator is a German trade expert, Sabine Weyand, adding to the impression that Mr Barnier will lead a team that means business.One of the biggest challenges he (and his boss Jean-Claude Juncker) faces, is to ensure that representatives of the big member states don't sideline him in the Brexit divorce negotiations.But Mr Barnier's long career in French politics means he could well have the ear of the Elysee Palace, especially if - as looks likely - a centre-right candidate wins the French presidency next year. The stakes are so high that there are bound to be some clashes.Mr Barnier has sparred with the UK's Minister for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, before, when the men both served as Europe ministers in the 1990s. It is another reminder that Michel Barnier is a politician first and foremost, rather than a bureaucrat. There have certainly been criticisms - a dash of vanity, a lack of attention to detail. His career has had plenty of downs as well as ups.But he will defend his European vision to the end, and the British government would do well not to underestimate him.At the height of the eurozone crisis, Mr Barnier always refused (politely) to do broadcast interviews in English.""One wrong word,"" he told me once with a smile, ""and we could move markets.""The next few years will be equally challenging."
2017-02-15,'Indyref 2' being pushed online,https://web.archive.org//web/20170215070453/http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-36615645,"As the EU referendum count turned decisively towards Leave, the online conversation in Scotland immediately turned to the possibility of another vote on independence.The idea has been long been dubbed ""indyref 2"" and that hashtag shot to the top of Twitter's trends list shortly after the vote result became clear. Scotland voted 62% in favour of Remain.The conversation online was being driven overwhelmingly by pro-independence campaigners.

""Indeed even the term 'Hard Brexit' requires amendment. The policy is now 'Brexit at any cost',"" he will say.""Our challenge is to expose relentlessly the actual cost, to show how this decision was based on imperfect knowledge which will now become informed knowledge, to calculate in 'easy to understand' ways how proceeding will cause real damage to the country and its citizens and to build support for finding a way out from the present rush over the cliff's edge.""Mr Blair, who campaigned to Remain in the EU, will say he accepts the verdict of June's referendum, but would recommend looking again at Brexit when ""we have a clear sense of where we're going"".He will also say the debate is being driven by immigration ""which I fully accept is a substantial issue"".""Nonetheless, we have moved in a few months from a debate about what sort of Brexit involving a balanced consideration of all the different possibilities; to the primacy of one consideration - namely controlling immigration from the EU - without any real discussion as to why and when Brexit doesn't affect the immigration people most care about.""A government spokesman said the British people had expressed their view very clearly on 23 June, adding: ""There will be no second referendum.""Iain Duncan Smith, who was a prominent Leave campaigner, said Mr Blair's comments were arrogant, utterly undemocratic and showed that the political elite was completely out of touch with the British people.  Supporters of leaving the EU argue it will free up the UK to trade better globally and give the government better control of immigration.What's next for Blair?Previously, Mr Blair has called for the views of the ""16 million"" people who had backed remaining in the EU not to be ignored. He has argued that there has to be a way, either ""through Parliament, or an election, or possibly through another referendum, in which people express their view"".Earlier this month, MPs overwhelmingly agreed to let the government begin the UK's departure from the EU by voting for the Brexit bill.The draft legislation was approved by 494 votes to 122, and now moves to the House of Lords.The government has promised to invoke Article 50 - setting formal talks with the EU in motion - by the end of next month, but it requires Parliament's permission before doing so."

2017-02-16,Aslef members reject Southern deal,https://web.archive.org//web/20170217030226/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-38994965,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkAslef members have rejected a deal with Southern rail that would have ended a long-running industrial dispute.It had been arguing with parent firm, Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR), over driver-only operated (DOO) trains.Members of the drivers' union rejected the deal by 54.1% to 45.9%. The turnout was 72.7%.Under the proposed agreement, Southern would have been able to run trains without a guard or onboard supervisor under certain circumstances.Mick Whelan, general secretary of Aslef, said: ""We understand and support the decision arrived at democratically by our members and will now work to deliver a resolution in line with their expectations.""Live updates: Southern strike and Sussex newsDavid Sidebottom, of independent watchdog Transport Focus, said: ""The hope that services would improve on Southern has now been dashed for their passengers.""They have had enough of the on-going industrial action. They have faced months of lost time, lost money and deep frustration at not being able to rely on the trains.""It is vital that all parties in this dispute get back around the table to bring the services back to normal as soon as possible.""Nick Brown, GTR's chief operating officer, said: ""Naturally we're saddened and hugely disappointed, as will be our passengers, with today's decision by drivers, particularly as the agreement carried the full support and recommendation of the Aslef leadership. ""We now need to understand the issues which led to this outcome and we'll be seeking to meet with the union as soon as possible to see how we can agree a way forward.""Why is there a Southern rail strike?The dispute centres on Southern's decision to turn guards into on-board supervisors. In this role they would no longer be responsible for opening and closing carriage doors - this duty would become the responsibility of the driver.The dispute began in April when conductors - who are members of the RMT union - first took industrial action.Aslef members first walked out over the plans in December, leading to the cancellation of all Southern services.Aslef leaders announced they had reached a deal with GTR on 2 February following 11 days of talks.The RMT said at the time it was ""a shocking betrayal"", and it has it now been rejected by Aslef members.A DfT spokesman said: ""It is disappointing that Aslef members have rejected the offer negotiated by their leaders at the TUC.""The union leadership must now return to talks and work with their members on a deal they can back.""  RMT leader Mick Cash said his union remained ""focused"" on the campaign to ""protect the safety of the travelling public and put access and safe operation before profits"".He added: ""[We] will now look to take that campaign into its next phase [by] working with our sister rail unions, the wider trade union movement and the passengers who use the railway.""RMT repeats the call to Southern to give the guarantee of a second, safety critical member of staff on their trains and to sit down with the unions in new talks around the issue of safe train despatch.""The RMT held separate talks with Southern managers earlier this week, which broke down without an agreement after three hours.On Wednesday, it announced further industrial action, saying conductors would walk out for 24 hours on 22 February. There we have it. Aslef drivers voted by a small majority to reject the deal their leaders had struck with Southern. That's not entirely surprising. Many saw the announcement of the deal as the end of the dispute, but that was wishful thinking. Once we saw the details it was clear some drivers wouldn't be happy. That deal gave a list of ""exceptional circumstances"" under which a train might run without its scheduled Onboard Supervisor, or OBS. Even assurances that those 'exceptional circumstances' didn't include RMT strike action proved insufficient. This wasn't just about solidarity with striking guards. Many drivers remain unconvinced that trains can be run safely without an OBS on board. What happens next depends on the reaction of key players. Southern moved quickly to offer fresh talks, and Aslef's Mick Whelan promised to ""work to deliver a resolution"" - with a relatively small 54.1% majority of drivers rejecting the deal, they'll hope it won't take too many tweaks to produce an acceptable deal. But commuters will be painfully aware of the disruption further strikes would cause. This dispute has run for months and there's no longer much cause to feel like it's coming to an end. "

The worst offenders include the US, Japan, Nigeria and Russia.The Foreign Office insists diplomats are not exempt from paying the charge.According to Transport for London (TfL), around three quarters of embassies in London do pay the charge, ""but there remains a stubborn minority who refuse to do so, despite our representations through diplomatic channels"".The US Embassy, which argues it is a tax and so covered by diplomatic immunity, owes the most, at more than £11.5m, while the Australian High Commission is among nations that owe the least, at £120.Top 10 congestion charge embassy debtors:Following legal advice, TfL's view is that the matter should be taken to the International Court of Justice in The Hague, but this needs government support, which is why it has been raised with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.Paul Cowperthwaite, TfL's general manager for congestion charging, said: ""We are clear that the congestion charge is a charge for a service and not a tax. This means that foreign diplomats are not exempt from paying it.""We continue to pursue all unpaid congestion charge fees and related penalty charge notices.""In October we wrote to the foreign secretary to ask him to take up the matter with the relevant embassies and the International Court of Justice.""Solution soughtTfL figures suggest that London-based embassies owe £105,258,715 for the period since the congestion charge was launched in 2003 and 31 December 2016 - up from £58m in 2012.A Foreign Office spokesman said: ""Our position is clear: there are no legal grounds to exempt diplomats from paying the London congestion charge. This is not a tax, and the majority of diplomatic missions in London recognise this and pay.""We are committed to working with TfL to find a solution to the problem of non-payment by some missions."" The congestion charge was introduced by former London mayor Ken Livingstone in February 2003, with the aim of reducing traffic congestion in and around the city centre between 07:00 and 18:00 Mondays to Fridays. The current charge is £11.50 per day."

Families spent an average of £72.70, or 14% of their budgets, on transport.We spent more on buying cars, but less on fuel, which became cheaper. The next biggest expense was housing.Excluding mortgages and council tax, we spent an average of £72.50 a week on our homes.That includes rent, heating, water and maintenance charges.The figures show big regional variations in spending on alcohol and tobacco.Households in Scotland spent an average of £8.90 a week on alcohol, compared to £7.80 in the UK as a whole.Scots drink considerably more spirits and liqueurs than other Britons, the figures show.Expenditure on cigarettes is even more varied.  Families in England spend just £2.90 a week on tobacco, while those in Wales spend £3, those in Scotland spend £4.90 and those in Northern Ireland spend £6.60.Families also continue to spend more on communications - with an average of £16 a week being spent on phones and postal services.In all, 95% of families in the UK own a mobile phone, the same proportion that have central heating."
2017-02-16,NHS probe over 'skunk death' of peer's son,https://web.archive.org//web/20170217030226/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-38994637,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkA hereditary peer has told the BBC his 21-year-old son killed himself days after being turned away from hospital because of a lack of beds.Lord Nicholas Monson said his son, Rupert Green, had suffered from psychosis as a result of an addiction to skunk - a strong form of cannabis.Rupert was assessed in hospital and it was agreed he needed a bed, but staff could not find one, Lord Monson says.Surrey and Borders NHS Trust said it was sorry and was investigating.Rupert, who was a biology student at the University of Essex, died last month.Lord Monson told BBC Radio 5 live's Emma Barnett that he had noticed a change in his son's behaviour last year when he had not heard from him for a while. He said: ""Suddenly I got a call from him and he apologised for not contacting me.""He said he'd failed his biology exams at university.  ""He said 'Spies are trying to break into my computer and I think spies are also in my computer'. Everything about him had changed.""Lord Monson says his son was assessed at hospital. He said: ""The nurse assessed Rupert and said that he really does need to go into a hospital and rang round all the hospitals and none of them would take him.  ""They said they didn't have any beds... the following day he was assessed by his local psychiatry team and they decided if Rupert just carried on taking the pills, then the psychosis would subside.""Lord Monson said his son killed himself a few days later.Jo Young, director of quality at Surrey and Borders Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, said: ""I am sorry for what happened and we are undertaking an internal investigation into Rupert's care and treatment with us. ""This will help us understand where we can learn lessons to further improve our support of people such as Rupert.""   Lord Monson has now lost two children in recent years after his eldest son, Alexander, died in police custody in Kenya in 2012 and said he is ""very angry"" with himself about what has happened.An inquest last year found that Alexander, aged 28, had died ""violently"" at the hands of the police.Since Rupert's death, Lord Monson has launched a campaign calling for skunk to be reclassified from a Class B drug to Class A. He said: ""In the old days, the psychoactive substance in cannabis was about 1.37% and now it's 22% with skunk... they have taken what is actually quite a decent plant and turned it into a monster.""Lord Monson also wants milder forms of cannabis to be legalised. He said the reaction to his campaign has been ""extraordinary"" and he is shocked by the amount of families who have come forward with similar drugs problems.  Lord Monson added: ""I know of three friends of mine... one whose son, because of skunk, tried to kill himself.  ""His brave mother thought: 'I'm going to try this stuff [skunk] and see what it's like'. And she says it was an absolute nightmare.""She said it was like confronting the devil himself when she looked in the mirror.  ""There's another one who's got long-term psychiatric problems and will probably never be the same again. ""And there's another one who's been dabbling with it at college and he's been suffering from suicidal tendencies and his mother is trying to find a safe place away from the college.""A Home Office spokesman said: ""This government has no plans to legalise cannabis. ""There is a substantial body of scientific and medical evidence to show that it is a harmful drug which can damage people's mental and physical health.""Details of organisations offering information and support with addiction or emotional distress are available at BBC Action Line, or you can call for free, at any time to hear recorded information for addiction on 0800 155 947 or emotional distress on 0800 066 066."
2017-02-16,Attacks on judges 'undermine law',https://web.archive.org//web/20170217030226/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-38986228,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe president of the UK's Supreme Court has criticised politicians for not doing enough to defend judges following a row over the Brexit legal challenge.Lord Neuberger said politicians did not speak out quickly or clearly enough and some media attacks had been unfair.He said unjustified attacks on the judiciary undermined the rule of law.After the government lost the Article 50 case at the High Court, a Daily Mail headline called the three judges in the case ""enemies of the people"".Lord Chancellor and justice minister Liz Truss said she was ""delighted"" that Lord Neuberger was ""proactively talking about the role of the judiciary in public."" She added: ""It is right that everyone understands the importance of its independence and the rule of law in a free society.""Lord Neuberger, who retires in September, was speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme a month after the Supreme Court ruled that only Parliament, not ministers, had the power to trigger the UK's exit from the EU because that was where laws were made.The Daily Mail's front page story was published when the government lost the first stage of the legal battle at the High Court last November.That story sparked a furious row with critics, including MPs from all parties, accusing Liz Truss, the lord chancellor and justice secretary, of not standing up for an independent judiciary.The Supreme Court, the final court of appeal in the UK for civil cases - and for criminal cases from England, Wales and Northern Ireland - hears cases of the greatest public or constitutional importance affecting the whole population. Its justices also sit as the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council and as such will occasionally hear appeals against the death penalty from Commonwealth countries.In an average year, the Supreme Court hears about 90 appeals and makes about 80 judgements on important issues of law.In his interview, Lord Neuberger did not single out any newspaper or politician, but said: ""We [judges in general] were certainly not well treated. One has to be careful about being critical of the press particularly as a lawyer or judge because our view of life is very different from that of the media.""I think some of what was said was undermining the rule of law.""Asked whether politicians had responded quickly enough to defend the judiciary and rule of law, Lord Neuberger said: ""They were certainly vocal enough quickly enough after our hearing [in the Supreme Court].""After the [High] Court hearing. I think they could have been quicker and clearer.  But we all learn by experience, whether politicians or judges. It's easy to be critical after the event. They were faced with an unexpected situation from which like all sensible people they learned.""Lord Neuberger said that undermining the judiciary also undermined the rule of law as judges were ""the ultimate guardians"" of it. ""The rule of law together with democracy is one of the two pillars on which our society is based,"" he added. ""And therefore if, without good reason, the media or anyone else undermines the judiciary that risks undermining our society.""The press and the media generally have a positive duty to keep an eye on things. But I think with that power comes the degree of responsibility.""By Clive Coleman, BBC Legal correspondent The country's judges were stung and hurt by the description of three of the most senior members of their ranks as 'enemies of the people'.  As a body they feel they cannot respond to such criticism publicly - judges must after all speak through their judgements alone, and the occasional public lecture.  Being dragged into the forum of public debate is seen as something that diminishes public confidence in their independence.  Whilst some senior retired judges such as the former Lord Chief Justice Lord Judge did speak out after the press coverage of the High Court Article 50 ruling, Lord Neuberger is the most senior serving judge to do so publicly.  He retires in September so perhaps he feels that the reins are off, or at least loosened.  His fellow judges will be quietly delighted that he has expressed his views on what they saw as an unfair attack on their independence and the rule of law… but they won't say that publicly.Kelvin MacKenzie, a former editor of the Sun, told the BBC Lord Neuberger was being ""overly sensitive"" and said judges ""cannot sit above argument or above criticism"".""[Newspapers] certainly haven't undermined the rule of law,"" he said. ""They have simply added to a debate going on outside the legal entity called the Supreme Court and there is nothing wrong with that. We call that free speech. ""Surely he is not indicating that free speech should have a limit in relation to the Supreme Court and a judgement [over Brexit] which had an enormous impact on a number of people? It is quite wrong.""The interview with Lord Neuberger comes on the same day the Supreme Court begins taking applications for new justices. As well as a new president to replace him, there is the need for two further justices after the retirement of Lord Toulson in 2016, and the upcoming retirement of Lord Clarke.The current bench is made up of one woman and 10 men, all white and from affluent backgrounds.On announcing his retirement last year, Lord Neuberger called for a diverse list of candidates to take the jobs. ""The higher echelons of the judiciary in the United Kingdom suffer from a marked lack of diversity and here I must admit the Supreme Court does not score at all well,"" he said. ""We have one white woman and 10 white men, and, although two of the 11 were not privately educated, none of us come from disadvantaged backgrounds.""Ms Truss welcomed the comments. She said: ""I am pleased to see him encouraging the widest pool of talent for the recruitment of three Supreme Court judges, which will enhance and strengthen our outstanding judiciary.""Applications will close on 10 March. There will then be shortlisting, interviews and consultation exercises, with the names of the new appointments expected to be announced in July. They will take up office at the beginning of the new legal year in October.Three more justices - Lord Mance, Lord Hughes and Lord Sumption - will retire before the end of 2018, as the statutory retirement age for judges is 70.

2017-02-16,UKIP urges 80% cut in foreign aid budget,https://web.archive.org//web/20170217030226/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38983952,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkUKIP is calling for an 80% cut in the foreign aid budget and for money to be spent instead on domestic services.It said much of the UK's spend, £12.5bn in 2015, was ineffective in alleviating poverty and left recipients worse off by perpetuating bad government. It wants spending to be stripped back to humanitarian and emergency aid only and a law guaranteeing 0.7% of national income be spent to be repealed.The government said the aid budget helped boost ""security and prosperity"".The UK's humanitarian spending has more than doubled since 2011.In 2015, the UK spent £1.26bn on humanitarian assistance around the world, including in war zones like Syria and Yemen, compared with £422m in 2011.It accounted for 16% of all bilateral aid - money which is directly spent in countries, regions and projects of the UK's choice - compared with 13% on governance and society, 12% on health and 12% on economic development. The government remains committed to the 0.7% target despite unease among some of its MPs about whether the aid budget, one of few areas to see an increase in spending in recent years, is providing value for money.Publishing a report on the UK's aid commitments on the eve of its spring conference, UKIP - a longstanding critic of UK policy - said spending should be pared back to £2.5bn a year focusing on emergency responses and eradicating disease.It claimed the existing budget was being ""abused"" to fund political advocacy and that multilateral spending through external partners, which accounted for 37% of total UK spending in 2015, incurred huge administrative costs.The 0.7% spending guarantee, enshrined in law in 2015, was based on ""inaccurate assumptions"" about how best to generate economic development, it said, with aid in some cases providing an obstacle to internal reform and trade innovation.""An increasing body of evidence suggests that more aid is not the best path to prosperity for developing countries but that more trade is,"" said the party's foreign aid spokeswoman Lisa Duffy. ""For too long, our government has prioritised ineffective aid spending over its basic obligations to British citizens.""But a spokeswoman for the Department for International Development said: ""The UK aid budget invests in our security and prosperity and is a key part of Global Britain's international leadership as we leave the EU.""All DfID programmes and partners are subject to rigorous checks and scrutiny to ensure we reach the world's poorest and most vulnerable, while also achieving the best value for UK taxpayers.""The government has said its assistance is saving thousands of lives in Syria, where the UK is the second largest single donor, and other conflict zones.Since 2010, the UK has re-focused its aid budget, with increased spending on countries such as Pakistan, Afghanistan, South Sudan and Somalia seen as critical to regional security and countering the spread of violent Islamic extremism.

2017-02-16,US to Nato: Pay more or we'll do less,https://web.archive.org//web/20170217030226/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-38984947,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe new US defence secretary has told Nato members that Washington will ""moderate its commitment"" to the alliance if they do not increase their spending on defence.James Mattis's comments repeat President Donald Trump's demand that members raise their spending to meet a target of 2% of their GDP.Only five of the 27 countries do so.Earlier, Mr Mattis had hailed Nato as the ""fundamental bedrock"" of trans-Atlantic co-operation.According to a text of his remarks, Mr Mattis said at the Nato headquarters in Brussels: ""No longer can the American taxpayer carry a disproportionate share of the defence of Western values.""Americans cannot care more for your children's future security than you do,"" he added.Commentators said this was some of the strongest criticism in years to allies who have not hit their spending goals. Mr Mattis said members must show progress this year and adopt a plan to increase their contributions, even if slowly.Only the US, UK, Estonia, Greece and Poland currently meet the target, but others are on course to reach that level.""America will meet its responsibilities, but if your nations do not want to see America moderate its commitment to this alliance, each of your capitals needs to show support for our common defence,"" Mr Mattis said.The US defence chief added that investing in common defence was vital, and cited the threats that have emerged since 2014, such as the annexation of Crimea by Russia and the rise of so-called Islamic State in Syria and Iraq, on the southern border of member Turkey.General James Mattis, the former Nato insider, has delivered a thunderbolt aimed at the complacency of many of Washington's European allies. He has put them on notice. No longer will the US taxpayer bear a disproportionate share of the defence burden. If the Europeans do not dig more deeply into their pockets then the Trump administration ""will moderate its  commitment"" to Nato. Quite what this means is unclear. Surely the US would not weaken the alliance by limiting its own contributions? Well that's a proposition presumably that Gen Mattis believes will not be tested. He must hope that his warning, and a warning it was - however eloquent and hedged around with words of reassurance  - will force Nato allies to pay more. This debate matters now more than ever because there is a new species of US president with few of the predictable reflexes of previous occupants of the White House. There is also a resurgent Russian threat and a diverse array of worrying challenges on Nato's southern flank. The US has deployed thousands of troops and hundreds of vehicles to the alliance's eastern borders to reassure its allies. Now they are going to have to foot more of the bill.Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said alliance members were already increasing their contributions.And UK Defence Secretary, Michael Fallon, said he had urged countries to increase their spending, even if they could not meet the 2% target. ""An annual increase that we're asking them to commit to would at least demonstrate good faith.""The meeting was held amid concern over the new administration's ties with Russia and the resignation of Michael Flynn as US national security adviser.Mr Trump's comments, during his campaign, that the US might not defend allies who do not contribute their ""fair share"" to Nato, had worried many European nations, particularly those near Russia's border.He was critical of the Western military alliance, describing it as ""obsolete"".But Mr Mattis showed strong support for the alliance, hailing its ability to respond to security challenges. ""The alliance remains a fundamental bedrock for the United States and the trans-Atlantic community, bonded as we are together,"" he said."
2017-02-16,Rethink urged on end to Dubs amendment,https://web.archive.org//web/20170217030226/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-38988321,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe UK's four children's commissioners have written to the government asking for a rethink of a decision to end a scheme bringing in lone child refugees.Campaigners hoped 3,000 children would come into the UK under the so-called Dubs amendment, but last week the home secretary said it would be 350. The commissioners for England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland said they have ""deep concern"" after the decision. The government said it was committed to resettling 3,000 vulnerable children.A spokeswoman said resettling children under the Dubs amendment was ""just one way we area helping.""""We have also committed to resettle up to 3,000 vulnerable children and family members from the MENA [Middle East and North Africa] region and 20,000 Syrians by the end of this Parliament.""The Dubs amendment, designed by the Labour peer and former child refugee Lord Dubs, aimed to help some of the estimated 90,000 unaccompanied migrant children across Europe.The commissioners wrote that the number of children who had come in under the scheme so far ""falls significantly short of expectations"" and, as a signatory to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, the UK should ""play a far greater role"".The letter, signed by Anne Longfield, Children's Commissioner for England, and Tam Baillie, Sally Holland and Koulla Yiasouma - her counterparts in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - called on Home Secretary Amber Rudd to ""consider carefully the plight of the many thousands of lone child refugees in Europe who are currently at risk of exploitation and trafficking"".""We urge the Government to act humanely and responsibly, and to maintain a positive commitment to the Dubs scheme within a comprehensive strategy to safeguard unaccompanied child refugees within Europe,"" it read.The letter has received praise from Labour MP Yvette Cooper, who chairs the Home Affairs Select Committee.She said: ""This is a very serious response from the children's commissioners. They make clear that far from avoiding traffickers, by ditching the Dubs scheme, the government risks pushing more children back into the arms of smuggler gangs.""The government should listen to this call from the commissioners whose very purpose is to protect the welfare of vulnerable children and reopen the Dubs scheme now.""Ms Rudd has defended the decision in the House of Commons, saying it had been made after France raised concerns that the amendment could be encouraging more children to make the perilous journey to Europe.""I am clear that when working with my French counterparts they do not want us to indefinitely continue to accept children under the Dubs amendment because they specify, and I agree with them, that it acts as a draw,"" she said.""It acts as a pull. It encourages the people traffickers.""A statement from a government spokeswoman added: ""We have a proud history of offering protection to those who need it and children will continue to arrive in the UK from around the world through our other resettlement schemes and asylum system.""But critics, including the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev Justin Welby, and the head of the Catholic Church in England and Wales, Cardinal Vincent Nichols, have called for a reversal of the decision. A legal challenge against ending the scheme is expected to reach the High Court in May."
2017-02-16,UK wage growth outpaces inflation,https://web.archive.org//web/20170217030226/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-38979582,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkWages grew faster than the rate of inflation at the end of 2016, official figures show.In the three months to December, wages grew 2.6% on an annualised basis in the UK, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). However, that was slower than the previous period, leading analysts to suggest households could face a ""squeeze"" on spending later this year.The ONS also said the jobless rate held steady at an 11-year low of 4.8%.The number of non-UK nationals working in the UK increased by 233,000 to 3.48 million compared with a year ago.""The unemployment rate is now at its lowest in over a decade, but wage growth remains subdued by historical standards,"" the ONS said in its commentary.Wage growth slowed from the 2.8% rate seen in the three months to November.That still outpaced the rise in household prices, but the gap between them narrowed. Annual inflation as measured by the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) reached 1.8% last month, up from a rate of 1.6% in December.""We expect real household incomes to be squeezed this year,"" said Ian Kernohan, an economist at Royal London Asset Management.Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, agreed: ""With inflation forecast to hit 2.8% early next year, a deceleration in pay growth could see real wages fall at some stage.""However, Mr Brettell added that the UK jobs market had remained resilient, despite warnings it would be hit by the Brexit vote. ""The UK labour market continues to confound the doom-mongers with its resilience to the Brexit shock,"" he said.The employment rate edged higher to 74.6%, which was a record high, according to the ONS data.""Continued moderate growth in employment has led to a new high in the total employment rate, while the rate for women has reached 70% for the first time on record,"" said ONS senior statistician David Freeman.UK unemployment fell by 7,000 to 1.6 million people, the ONS found.It is not the unemployment figures that are interesting these days, it is the employment figures. There is not the direct link between the two figures that many think. Employment doesn't rise by the same amount that unemployment falls. That's because many thousands of people leave school or university, come back from maternity leave or just decide to look for work every month, who weren't counted as unemployed. Those and many other factors, like increasing numbers working beyond the retirement age, help explain why employment has risen to record levels while unemployment only fell by 7,000 in the three months to December. Less clear is why wages are only rising by 2.6% a year. These levels of employment suggest companies are having trouble finding skilled staff to fill vacancies and that normally forces wages much higher. There was a small rise in the number of workers born outside the European Union, but a small drop in the number of workers born in other EU countries.Mr Freeman said those figures ""should be treated with caution"", however, because they were not adjusted for seasonal changes.The job figures are based on the Labour Force Survey in which the ONS talks to about 40,000 households, or 100,000 individuals, every three months.As it is a survey, the results are estimates and have a margin of error.For example, the ONS is 95% confident that its estimate of a fall in unemployment of 7,000 is correct to within 80,000, so the drop is described as not being statistically significant.Separately, an ONS ""flash"" estimate indicated that UK productivity grew for a fourth successive quarter in the fourth quarter of 2016 - but at a slightly reduced rate. It reported that output per hour worked rose 0.3% quarter-on-quarter - the weakest improvement since the fourth quarter of 2015. It was down from gains of 0.4% quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter, 0.5% in the second and 0.4% in the first.""The UK has a lot of catching up to do on the productivity front and is markedly lagging its performance before the 2008-09 downturn,"" said Howard Archer, chief UK and European Economist at IHS Global Insight.He said that part of the UK's recent poor labour productivity performance had been due to the fact that employment held up well during the downturn and then picked up markedly.

2017-02-16,Job ad to help AM's brother discussed,https://web.archive.org//web/20170217030226/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-38985042,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkA UKIP AM discussed with an assembly official how an advert for a job in her office could be changed to help her brother get an interview for the post. Michelle Brown was told that if she used an initial draft of the advert her brother would be ""sifted out"".She was also asked if she wanted to ""check"" with him what qualifications he had before finalising the advert.North Wales AM Ms Brown said she had acted with ""complete propriety"". The institution refused to release under the Freedom of Information Act full details of an exchange between Ms Brown and an assembly official where they discuss what qualifications her brother has.But BBC Wales understands that following an initial discussion about his qualifications the official wrote to Ms Brown: ""If we go ahead with the qualification that's in the job description [an NVQ] Richard [Ms Brown's brother] will be sifted out before the interview stage. ""Do you want me to change it to [GCSE] Grade C or above in English?""Ms Brown replied: ""Can it [the NVQ] be downgraded to desirable?""The official then said: ""We do need to have some qualification in the essential [section of the advertisement], do you want to check with Richard what he has?""Ms Brown replied: ""Fair enough! Shall we just leave it as GCSE English and Maths at Grade C or equivalent?""The official then told her ""that's fine"".The job advert was for a receptionist and personal assistant, to be paid between £18,536 and £24,593 a year.The NVQ requirement was not included in the final advertisement.BBC Wales understands Ms Brown's brother did not get the job.The assembly said its recruitment panel recommended someone else to Ms Brown and she will meet that person next week to discuss the position.But her brother is still listed on the register of members interests as a constituency caseworker for the assembly member and he has been in that role since June 2016.AMs are allowed to appoint staff on a temporary basis for a six month period after being elected without having to put in place a formal recruitment procedure.BBC Wales understands concerns have been raised within UKIP about Ms Brown's brother's performance.A total of 12 AMs have declared on the register of interests that they employ relatives.In 2009, an independent report recommended the appointment of family members be stopped.Defending her handling of the recruitment process for her office, Ms Brown said: ""I appointed Richard upon my election to the assembly, as I needed someone to deal immediately with constituency issues.  ""Confidentiality and personal loyalty are essential elements in the job description of all AMs' staff.  ""When his temporary contract expired, he was not re-appointed.  ""The Assembly Commission is intimately involved in devising job descriptions for open competition and, in the case of AMs' family members, they interview candidates independently of the AM.""I have acted at all material times on the advice of the commission and with complete propriety.  ""Any suggestion to the contrary from within UKIP should be discounted as sour grapes from someone with an axe to grind.""Asked about the matter on BBC Radio Wales, UKIP assembly group leader Neil Hamilton said: ""The assembly commission is entirely responsible for job descriptions.""All these jobs have to be publicly advertised and in the case of somebody who is a family member who is an applicant then the appointment decision is taken by the assembly itself, not by the individual AM.""In November 2016, Mr Hamilton defended the employment of his wife Christine as his personal assistant on the same grounds.In a statement, the National Assembly for Wales Commission, which overseas appointments at the body said: ""The principles of fair and open competition based on merit apply to all posts advertised for assembly member support staff.""The appointment of the employing assembly member's family members is only permissible where the member plays no part in the assessment and interviews, which are instead conducted by the members' business support team.""Asked about the email exchange involving Ms Brown, an assembly spokeswoman said: ""It is entirely appropriate, and within the rules, for Members' Business Support to work with individual Assembly Members to establish selection criteria and arrangements for a particular appointment."""

2017-02-16,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20170217030226/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThis article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide to the UK's vote to leave the European Union. It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 52% to 48%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who resigned on the day after losing the referendum. Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she says she will respect the will of the people. She has said ""Brexit means Brexit"" but there is still a lot of debate about what that will mean in practice especially on the two key issues of how British firms do business in the European Union and what curbs are brought in on the rights of European Union nationals to live and work in the UK. She set out more details of her negotiating hopes in her key speech on Brexit.The UK economy appears to have weathered the initial shock of the Brexit vote, although the value of the pound remains near a 30-year low, but opinion is sharply divided over the long-term effects of leaving the EU. Some major firms such as Easyjet and John Lewis have pointed out that the slump in sterling has increased their costs. Britain also lost its top AAA credit rating, meaning the cost of government borrowing will be higher. But share prices have recovered from a dramatic slump in value, with both the FTSE 100 and the broader FTSE 250 index, which includes more British-based businesses, trading higher than before the referendum. The Bank of England cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - a record low and the first cut since 2009 - after the vote and there has not been the economic slump or recession that some had predicted. The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it has to invoke an agreement called Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May has said she intends to trigger this process by the end of March 2017, meaning the UK will be expected to have left by the summer of 2019, depending on the precise timetable agreed during the negotiations. The government will also enact a Great Repeal Bill which will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. It is expected to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove.After a court battle, the UK's Supreme Court ruled in January that Parliament must be consulted before Article 50 is invoked. This is why a two line Brexit bill is currently making its way through Parliament. MPs have approved it after Labour MPs were told to support it. It is now heading to the House of Lords to be debated and voted on.Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These men - dubbed the Three Brexiteers - will play a central role in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although it will be Mrs May, as prime minister, who will have the final say. David Cameron's government did not do any emergency planning for Brexit ahead of the referendum and Mrs May has rejected calls to say what her negotiating goals are.Once Article 50 has been triggered, the UK will have two years to negotiate its withdrawal. But no one really knows how the Brexit process will work - Article 50 was only created in late 2009 and it has never been used. Former Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, now Chancellor, wanted Britain to remain in the EU, and he has suggested it could take up to six years for the UK to complete exit negotiations. The terms of Britain's exit will have to be agreed by 27 national parliaments, a process which could take some years, he has argued. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. The UK will continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making.Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Following Theresa May's Brexit recent speech we now know that the UK is not intending to stay in the EU's single market. Although there has been speculation for months about the issue, it would have meant the UK staying under the auspices of the European Court of Justice and having to allow unlimited EU immigration, under freedom of movement rules.Both sides want trade to continue after Brexit with the UK seeking a positive outcome for those who wish to trade goods and services"" - such as those in the City of London and wanting a ""comprehensive free trade deal"" giving the UK ""the greatest possible access"" to the single market. Mrs May says she wants the UK to reach a new customs union deal with the EU. A customs union is where countries agree not to impose tariffs on each others' goods and have a common tariff on goods coming in from elsewhere. The UK is currently part of the EU customs union but that stops the UK being able to do its own trade deals with other countries. Reality Check: How could customs union work?These terms have increasingly been used as debate focused on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people in order to maintain access to the EU single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result.The government has declined to give a firm guarantee about the status of EU nationals currently living in the UK, saying this is not possible without a reciprocal pledge from other EU members about the millions of British nationals living on the continent. EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, will be be able to stay, the chief civil servant at the Home Office has said. The rights of other EU nationals would be subject to negotiations on Brexit and the ""will of Parliament"", he added.A lot depends on the kind of deal the UK agrees with the EU. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions on EU nationals, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.Again, it depends on whether the UK government decides to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages. Citizens' Advice has reminded people their rights have not changed yet and asked anyone to contact them if they think they have been discriminated against following the Leave vote.Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested EU migrants who come to the UK as Brexit nears may not be given the right to stay. He has said there might have to be a cut-off point if there was a ""surge"" in new arrivals.People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote. The day-to-day spending impact is likely to be more significant. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it to remain at least 10% below where it was on 23 June, in the long term. This means imported goods will consequently get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have already been seen and the issue was most notably illustrated by the dispute between Tesco and Marmite's makers about whether prices would be put up or not in the stores.The latest UK inflation figures, for January, showed the CPI inflation rate rising to 1.8%, its highest level for two and a half years, with signs of more cost pressures set to feed through in the months to come.Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration.She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations. As mentioned above, the key issue is whether other EU nations will grant the UK access to the single market, if that is what it wants, while at the same time being allowed to restrict the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK.Mrs May has said she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. It is currently running at 330,000 a year, of which 184,000 are EU citizens, and 188,000 are from outside the EU - the figures include a 39,000 outflow of UK citizens.It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Liberal Democrats - who have just a handful of MPs - have vowed to halt Brexit and keep Britain in the EU if they were to win the next general election.Some commentators, including former House of Commons clerk Lord Lisvane, have argued that a further referendum would be needed to ratify whatever deal the UK hammers out with the EU, but there are few signs political leaders view this as a viable option.Yes. Theresa May has appeared keen to avoid a vote on her negotiating stance, to avoid having to give away her priorities, but Theresa May has said there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. It is worth mentioning that any deal also has to be agreed by the European Parliament - with British MEPs getting a chance to vote on it there.  While there could be limitations on British nationals' ability to live and work in EU countries, it seems unlikely they would want to deter tourists. There are many countries outside the European Economic Area, which includes the 28 EU nations plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway, that British citizens can visit for up to 90 days without needing a visa and it is possible that such arrangements could be negotiated with European countries.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. In theory, the government could, if it wanted, decide to change the colour, which is currently standardised for EU countries, says the BBC's Europe correspondent, Chris Morris.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketNo nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it is ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faces being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. A second independence referendum for the country is now ""highly likely"", she has said, although not in 2017. She has said she wants Scotland to stay in the single market and said Mrs May's decision to rule out the UK staying in the single market ""undoubtedly"" brings the referendum closer.Before his resignation Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said the impact in Northern Ireland would be ""very profound"" and that the whole island of Ireland should now be able to vote on reunification. But, speaking while she was still Northern Ireland Secretary, Theresa Villiers ruled out the call from Sinn Féin for a border poll, saying the circumstances in which one would be called did not exist. The land border is likely to be a key part of the Brexit talks. Theresa May said a priority for her would be negotiating a deal with the EU which allowed a common travel area between the UK and the Republic of Ireland.During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest. But his successor Theresa May has said she will keep it in place, at least for the current Parliament, which is due to last until 2020.So far there has been a cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. There are yet to be signs that rising inflation have worried the Bank of England  enough to consider raising interest rates.  But if that happened it would make mortgages and loans more expensive to repay - but would be good news for savers.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.Eurotunnel boss Jacques Gounon said last November the reintroduction of duty-free would be ""an incredible boost for my business"" but he later said  that remark had been ""light-hearted"". Erik Juul-Mortensen, president of the Tax Free World Association (TFWA) said after the referendum vote ""it is not possible to predict how Brexit will affect the duty free and travel retail industry, and it is wiser not to make assumptions about exactly what the impact will be.""  They are at the moment but no-one knows the longer term prospects for definite. The EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - is not an EU initiative. It was negotiated between countries within a group known as the European Economic Area, often simply referred to as the single market (plus Switzerland, which confusingly is not a member of the EEA, but has agreed access to the single market). Therefore, the future of Britons' EHIC cover could depend on whether the UK decided to sever ties with the EEA.Probably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report. In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two-thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.However, the UK government is committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, the UK government is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR. However, the EU has its own European Court of Justice, whose decisions are binding on EU institutions and member states.Its rulings have sometimes caused controversy in Britain and supporters of a Brexit have called for immediate legislation to curb its powers. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also cited sovereignty and democracy, and they wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Four of the biggest US banks have committed to helping maintain the City's position. But HSBC will move up to 1,000 jobs to Paris, the BBC understands. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Pest control firm Rentokil Initial says it could make £15m extra this year thanks to a weaker currency.Others are less optimistic. Hilary Jones, a director at UK cosmetics firm Lush said the company was ""terrified"" about the economic impact. She added that while the firm's Dorset factory would continue to produce goods for the UK market, products for the European market may be made at its new plant in Germany.Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After the Leave vote, the government will probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""As with most elements of the UK economy, not enough solid data has been published yet to accurately conclude the Brexit effect on house prices. Industry figures have pointed to ""uncertainty"" among buyers and sellers that could potentially change the housing market.So far, the most significant research has come from the respected Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which has published the conclusions of a survey of its members. This primarily records sentiment among surveyors.It found that house prices are expected to fall across the UK in the three months after the referendum vote. However, the dip in prices is only expected to persist over the 12 months from June in London and East Anglia, surveyors predict.House prices were already slowing in central London, owing to the fall-out from changes to stamp duty rules in April.Separate figures from property portal Rightmove suggested the average asking price of houses coming on to the market in England and Wales fell by 0.9%, or £2,647, in July compared with June. It said that agents had reported very few sales had fallen through as a result of the vote.Many potential first-time buyers would welcome a fall in house prices, with ownership among the young falling owing to affordability concerns. Investors in property, or those who have paid off a mortgage and hope to leave homes as inheritance would be unhappy with a long-term reduction in value.  Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law following the decision to leave the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" will not necessarily disappear overnight - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU means the UK will not be part of TTIP. It will have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Former Labour health secretary Lord Owen has said that because of TTIP (see answer above) the only way to protect the NHS from further privatisation was to get out of the EU."

Mr Snell is a member and former leader of Newcastle-under-Lyme Council, who campaigned for a Remain vote in the EU referendum.UKIP, which narrowly beat the Conservatives into second place in the 2015 general election, is fielding its leader, Paul Nuttall, as its candidate. The MEP was born in Bootle, where he has stood in the last three general elections.The Tories have chosen 25-year-old city councillor Jack Brereton. He is the deputy leader of the Conservative Group in the council's ruling coalition, where he is also the Cabinet member for Regeneration, Transport and Heritage. The Green Party has picked Adam Colclough as their candidate, with Zulfiqar Ali standing for the Liberal Democrats.See below for a full list of candidates.The successful Liberal Democrat by-election campaign in Richmond Park in December was seen as a result of the party making Brexit a key issue in what was a very Remain constituency.The wider Stoke area (which includes Stoke Central) voted strongly to Leave in June's referendum so the question is how much of an impact Brexit is likely to have. Since being created for the 1950 general election, Stoke Central has always returned Labour MPs.It has traditionally been seen as rock solid Labour territory and Mr Hunt won in 2015 by a 5,179 margin.Labour's majority has been decreasing sharply in recent years, from 49.5% in 1997 to 16.7% in 2015.Stoke-on-Trent Central covers the administrative centre of the six Potteries towns: Burslem, Fenton, Hanley, Longton, Stoke-upon-Trent and Tunstall.As BBC Midlands political editor Patrick Burns notes, this may be the last time the seat is contested.""For all its rich history and industrial heritage, it's set to be scrapped under proposed Parliamentary boundary changes which would reduce Stoke's present three seats to two,"" he says.""And with (Labour MPs) Ruth Smeeth and Rob Flello apparently in no mood to relinquish their neighbouring seats, it's no wonder that this is being unofficially dubbed as a job for three years.""Mr Nuttall has admitted a previous claim that he lost ""close personal friends"" in the Hillsborough disaster was wrong.The UKIP candidate apologised and said the quotes on his website from 2011 were ""wrong"" and had been taken down.There was also a clash with Labour over whether Mr Nuttall was actually living in the Stoke house registered as his address on nomination papers. UKIP later said he had to leave the house for safety reasons after the address was circulated on social media.Mr Snell, meanwhile, has apologised after some of his old tweets about people appearing on TV shows have re-emerged, including a description of panellists on ITV's Loose Women as ""squabbling sour-faced ladies"" and remarks about Janet Street-Porter and a woman on the BBC's The Apprentice.The Labour candidate also previously posted disparaging remarks about his party's current leader Jeremy Corbyn and Brexit.Here is a list of the candidates, in alphabetical order by surname:Polls open at 07:00 GMT on 23 February and close at 22:00 GMT."

The councillor and former doctor and ambulance driver was chosen from an all-woman shortlist.Up against her for the Conservatives is Trudy Harrison, who lives in the village of Bootle and was a parish councillor for a number of years.UKIP has chosen its 2015 general election candidate, Fiona Mills.The Liberal Democrats have chosen Rebecca Hanson and the Green Party Jack Lenox as their candidates. There are also two independent candidates - Michael Guest and Roy Ivinson.Copeland and its predecessor Whitehaven have been Labour since 1935, but the seat has become more marginal in recent years.Mr Reed, who had been an MP since 2005, held the seat by 2,564 votes from the Conservatives in 2015, with UKIP another 8,038 votes behind in third.The Tories are bidding to become the first governing party to make a by-election gain - not including a 1982 poll triggered by a defecting Labour MP - since 1960.With nearly 11,000 people employed at Sellafield, thousands more in the supply chain and a new power plant proposed in the constituency, the nuclear industry has been a key issue.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's previous opposition to new nuclear power stations has been highlighted by his opponents, although the Labour leader has since given his backing for the £10bn Moorside plant, due to open in 2024.Doubts were raised over the project after Toshiba, which has a 60% share in NuGen, the firm behind the scheme, sustained heavy losses.During a visit to the constituency, Prime Minister Theresa May was asked about union calls for the government to guarantee the investment to ensure the project goes ahead, saying her party ""recognises the importance"" of the nuclear industry.The prime minister also faced questions about the future of Whitehaven's West Cumberland Hospital, with Labour campaigning hard on the future of the maternity unit amid concerns consultant-led services could be moved elsewhere.A key link road, the A595, has also been inspected by both Transport Secretary, Chris Grayling and his Labour counterpart, Andy McDonald, with campaigners calling for urgent improvements to be made.Polls will be open from 07:00 GMT on 23 February until 22:00 BST, with the result expected overnight."

Sir Peter de la Mare, the Speaker or ""Prolocutor"" of the Good Parliament in April 1376 opened the first day with a long address on the shortcomings of the Crown - military failures, financial and moral corruption. Royal favourites were imprisoned. King Edward III's mistress, Alice Perrers, was condemned to ""seclusion"".  But by the autumn, royalty had fought back. The Parliament was dissolved and most of its work was undone. The King's mistress was back at Court.  The King's son, John of Gaunt, had Sir Peter de la Mare thrown in jail. And the new Speaker was John of Gaunt's own steward, the far more biddable Sir Thomas Huntingford.Until the 17th Century, the Speaker's loyalty was to the Crown rather than to MPs.  But they were often blamed if they delivered news the monarch didn't like.  It could be a dangerous job: seven Speakers were beheaded between 1394 and 1535.  That's why even today a new Speaker traditionally makes a show of being dragged reluctantly to the Chair.Staying on the right side of the Crown was especially tricky during the turmoil of the Wars of the Roses, when it was hard to be sure who would end up being the King.  One Speaker, John Wenlock, tried to hedge his bets by fighting on the side of both the Yorkists and the Lancastrians.   It didn't work out well. He was killed at the Battle of Tewkesbury, allegedly by his own commander who blamed Wenlock's general indecisiveness for the defeat. Gradually, the Speaker's role became one of representing Parliament, rather than the monarch. When Charles I came in person to the Commons on 4 January 1642 to arrest five MPs for treason, Speaker William Lenthall refused to reveal where they were. Hitherto seen as a rather timorous chap, this was his moment. He fell to his knees, but told the King: ""May it please your Majesty, I have neither eyes to see nor tongue to speak in this place but as the House is pleased to direct me, whose servant I am here.""  The King was humiliated and left without the men he'd come for.John Bercow is being criticised by some MPs today for - in their view - failing to be impartial on political issues. But the Speaker's impartiality is a relatively modern notion. In fact, some Speakers held other government offices at the same time.  They could take part in some debates and vote, when they weren't actually presiding over business. Arthur Onslow, who had the job for more than 30 years, began to change that. In fact, he used to boast of his impartiality - to the great irritation and disappointment of the Prime Minister, Sir Robert Walpole, who'd helped him to the job.It wasn't until the Victorian era that our current ideas of impartiality became the norm - though Irish Nationalists in the 1880s felt that Speaker Henry Brand stepped over the line in helping to put down their disruption in the Commons over Irish Home rule. In January 1881, they prolonged debate for 41 hours.  There were disorderly scenes. Irish MPs defied the Chair. And so, Speaker Brand helped the government to invent new procedures, still in use today, to cut the debate short on the Coercion Bill for Ireland.In spite of the controversies, it's almost unprecedented to sack a Speaker. Although in recent times, Michael Martin, was pressured into resigning, the only other one to be ousted forcibly was Sir John Trevor in 1695, who'd been found guilty of accepting a £1,000 bribe.  He also had the disadvantage of being so cross-eyed that MPs couldn't tell if he was giving them the nod to speak, or looking at someone else.And of course, for any MP who tries to oust a Speaker but fails, there's a big risk that in future debates, the Speaker seems strangely unable to see them at all, when they're hoping to be called."
2017-02-16,They said what?,https://web.archive.org//web/20170217030226/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38980742,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkIt was Abraham Lincoln's 208th birthday last weekend. The US Republican Party's social media feeds honoured the 16th president by sharing a picture of his iconic memorial in Washington DC, with an inspiring quote laid over the top. ""In the end, it's not the years in your life that counts, it's the life in your years,"" was the message on Twitter and Instagram, also shared by President Trump.There was just one problem: the words have been attributed to Lincoln many times over the years, but there is no evidence he ever said them. The post has since been deleted.It was the latest example of a growing modern phenomenon, the fake political quote.Some have said ""fake news"" could have swung the outcome of November's US presidential election. Bogus stories like ""Pope Francis Shocks World, Endorses Donald Trump for President"" were extensively shared online.Made up quotes are perhaps more benign than fictitious news stories with a clear political agenda. But they still raise concerns, says James Ball of Buzzfeed News, who is writing a book about ""post-truth"" politics.""If enough people share and believe these fake quotes, then they can contribute to the polarisation of politics, making each side think less of the other, especially as many partisans think fake news is a problem which affects primarily (or only) their opponents.""These fake quotes don't just come from right-wing politicians and activists. In the days after the US election, a quote supposedly taken from a 1998 Donald Trump interview went viral online. ""If I were to run, I'd run as a Republican. They're the dumbest group of voters in the country. They believe anything on Fox News. I could lie and they'd still eat it up,"" the quote said.It seemed too obnoxious to be true - and it was.Fake George Orwell quotes are a specialty in left-wing social media circles. One example is ""during times of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act."" There is no evidence the 1984 author ever said these words, but social media is awash with shareable pictures of them alongside Orwell's monochrome face.So how do bogus quotes like this get into circulation?""Sometimes people just want new followers or shares on social media, and either invent a quote or (naively or otherwise) lift a questionable one,"" says James Ball. ""Others invent quotes as a hoax or parody to show up people they disagree with, or to fire up their own side - or simply to make money from adverts on fake news sites.""The internet means fake quotes can spread very quickly. ""It's easier to fabricate things than it is to debunk them,"" says Rasmus Nielsen, director of research at the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at the University of Oxford. ""As communication gets easier, there is going to be more and more of this stuff floating about online.""Jenni Sargent runs First Draft News, which is working with social media companies and news organisations to look at innovative solutions to the problem.""People are experimenting with the most engaging way to spread false information,"" she says. She wants news websites to come up with entertaining ways of debunking fake facts and quotes.A blue tick next to a name on Twitter tells you the account has been verified as ""authentic"". Sargent wants to come up with ways to highlight unreliable sources, ""like the opposite of a blue tick"".Facebook is introducing tools for German users to flag false stories ahead of that country's parliamentary elections in the autumn. Third-party fact checkers would mark unreliable stories as ""disputed"".The BBC has also said it will fact check deliberately misleading stories ""masquerading as news"".   British MP Damian Collins is chairing a parliamentary inquiry into these issues, which will look at the possibility of news websites having ""verified"" markers. Collins thinks fake quotes attributed to electoral candidates could end up ""distorting the democratic process"".Often verifying quotes is simply a case of rigorously searching through publicly available information, says Kim LaCapria, who works for rumour-busting website Snopes. The volume of dubious content online is greater than ever before, but verification can be easier because far more information is digitised, she says. ""It's actually pretty easy for average social media users to fact check online.""Her job involves looking at outright fake quotes, but also real quotes presented in a misleading way. For example, Al Gore has been ridiculed for claiming he ""invented the internet"". The former vice president did once say ""I took the initiative in creating the Internet,"" but taken in full context, that line seems rather more modest.We are less likely to expend energy verifying a quote which confirms our political beliefs, says LaCapria, an effect which psychologists call confirmation bias.Whether a fake quote comes from the left or the right, it tends to have one common feature, she says.

The UK's vote to leave the EU, last June, came as a seismic shock to most MEPs. And many are quite open in their view that it amounts to a self-destructive decision by the British to uncouple themselves from one of modern history's primary drivers of peace and prosperity.British Eurosceptics of course would cast the Brexit vote in an entirely different light, and now foresee a future in which the UK will be free to make its fortune - and make its own new global trading relationships - unfettered from the dead hand of stifling Brussels bureaucracy.It will be years of course - perhaps many years - before we know who is on the right side of that debate.But one consequence of Brexit is already with us - the EU is now free to debate how it might work in the future without any input from the UK.In theory that should leave Europe's federalists freer to dream than they have been in the past. Britain's voice has generally been raised to question the wisdom and value of further integration that would give EU institutions greater powers at the expense of individual national governments. You would expect such dreams to be articulated best by Guy Verhofstadt - the former prime minister of Belgium, who now leads the liberal bloc in the European Parliament and who will represent that body in Brexit negotiations.In the debate on future reform Mr Verhofstadt said: ""The union is in crisis. The European Union doesn't have much friends: not at home, not abroad. ""The Union does not deliver anymore. Rather than to talk about an 'ever closer union', we have a union of 'too little, too late'. ""That's why people are angry: they see all these European institutions, all these summits, all these empty words, but they don't see enough results.""Mr Verhofstadt has a long list of suggested fixes for this continental malaise, including reducing or ending the right of individual members to opt out of collective decisions - something no British government would ever have countenanced. He has other ideas for how the EU should respond to Brexit too - including moving out of London the headquarters of two EU agencies: the European Banking Authority and the European Medicines Agency.But for now, at least, it seems radical visions for reform will be quietly kicked into touch.The vice-president of the EU Commission, Frans Timmermans, politely welcomed the display of ""vision"" in the proposals, but noted that most of the suggestions would require EU treaty change. He said simply: ""We have to acknowledge that treaty change is not on the top of the political agenda now, in member states in particular.""There are plenty of true believers in the European project who would see in the Verhofstadt proposals the start of a kind of counter-revolution against events which have dismayed them - including Brexit, the US election of Donald Trump and the strong opinion poll showing of insurgent parties in a number of European countries.Populist challenge brings Europe to crossroadsBrexit: All you need to knowBut for now a more cautious and pragmatic approach will prevail - partly because there is a general sense in Strasbourg and Brussels that the European institutions will have enough on their plates negotiating Brexit, without kicking off a parallel process of structural reform which would also take years.That takes us back to the idea that every crisis is an opportunity that shouldn't go to waste.There are, no doubt, those in Strasbourg who take that view - but it seems for the moment they are outweighed by those who feel that when you find yourself in the middle of a crisis - as they would see Brexit - the smartest course of action is to fix the crisis first and worry about the future later."
2017-02-16,Newsround guide,https://web.archive.org//web/20170217030226/http://www.bbc.com/newsround/38932500,"Last year, Newsround reported many stories about the refugee crisis in Europe.Millions of people - many of them children - were forced to leave where they lived because of fighting in the Middle East. In particular, the conflict in Syria drove millions of people from their homes. It also meant lots of families got separated from each other.Many travelled to Europe, in the hope that they might find a better life in a European country, with many hoping to come to the UK.The leaders of European countries have had many discussions to try to decide how to deal with so many extra people, who are now in Europe but have nowhere to live. Something called the Dubs Amendment formed part of how the UK said that it could help these refugees.Find out more about what it is below.Thousands of refugees fleeing across Europe ended up in Calais in north France, in a refugee camp known as the Jungle (which has now been shut down). Many came from Syria.This is because they hoped to cross over to England from there, to start a new life in the UK.While the Jungle was being used as a temporary home for thousands of people, there was a lot of worry about their safety - especially for children. Countries around Europe discussed how they were going to deal with all of these people who had nowhere to live and who were living in awful conditions in the Jungle. Some countries made promises about how many refugees they were going to take from the Jungle to live in their countries. The UK parliament made a decision about how the UK could help, which was called the Dubs Amendment.There is a piece of EU law, called the Dublin III regulation, that says that families have a right to stay together. This means that refugees have a right to go to join family members if they are legally in another country, so the family can be with each other.This meant that refugees living in Calais who had family members in the UK had a right to apply to come over here to join them. But there were many unaccompanied children in the Calais camp, who did not have families here.So the UK launched a scheme to enable a number of unaccompanied children to come to live safely in the UK - even if they did not have a straightforward family link here.It was called the Dubs Amendment. It was named after a man who led the scheme being introduced, called Lord Alf Dubs. He was a child refugee himself when he was younger, as he came over to the UK from Czechoslovakia when it was occupied by the Nazis during World War II.His father was Jewish, and so he and his family were in danger because the Nazis wanted to kill Jewish people. The UK gave him somewhere safe to live as a young boy.The Dubs Amendment did not make a promise about how many children could come to the UK. But Lord Dubs and his supporters said the UK could help about 3,000 refugee children.So far, around 200 children have come to the UK under the Dubs Amendment scheme. But the government has recently announced that it will stop the scheme after another 150 are settled here.They say that councils are not able to find homes for more children than this.This means that 350 children will have come to the UK because of it - not 3,000, as Lords Dubs suggested was possible.Many people think that the UK should let more children come to live here safely and that the government has not done what it said it would. Lord Dubs himself said that by stopping the scheme like this, he felt the government had ""gone back on their word"".But the government has said that the scheme only encourages more young people to make the dangerous journey across Europe in the hope they might be allowed to come to live here.It has said that it is not giving up on these vulnerable children, because there are other schemes that can help them to come to the UK."
2017-02-16,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20170217030226/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-38957903,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe claim: Pensioners are on average £20 a week better off than working-age people.Reality Check verdict: The calculation made by the Resolution Foundation is for household income after housing costs. Before housing costs are taken into account, working-age households still have higher incomes than pensioner households.News that pensioner households are now better off than working-age families was widely reported on Monday.There have been reports for some time that incomes for pensioners have been growing faster than those for working-age people, largely as a result of pensions being protected by the triple-lock, while many working-age benefits have been frozen.The triple-lock guarantees that pensions rise by the same as average earnings, the consumer price index, or 2.5%, whichever is the highest.But the report from the Resolution Foundation was the first suggestion that the retired had actually overtaken the working-age group.The figures referred to the ""typical pensioner household"", by which it meant the median, which is the household for which half of pensioner households have higher income and half of them have lower incomes.In this case, a pensioner household is one in which at least one member is of pension age or older (65 for men, 64 for women) whether or not that person is working. There can also be working people in a pensioner household.But the important factor that has been mentioned little in the coverage is that the measure of income that the Resolution Foundation is using is one for income after housing costs have been paid. Taking income after housing costs makes a huge difference because pensioner households are more likely to own their own homes and to have relatively small or paid-off mortgages.The report says, for example, that 70% of the silent generation (born 1926-45) own their homes outright, while just over 40% of the baby boomers (1946-65) own theirs, with another 30% still having mortgages to pay.    The median income for both working-age and pensioner households is just over £20,000 a year, so housing costs would make a big difference.Also, the figures do not take account of people in care homes, which would be expected to increase housing costs for those of pension age.The Resolution Foundation confirms in the report that before housing costs are paid, the median working-age household still has a higher income than the median pensioner household.

2017-02-16,Meet the EU's chief Brexit negotiator,https://web.archive.org//web/20170217030226/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37542204,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe British papers love a French villain at the heart of the EU.Is Michel Barnier about to succeed Jacques Delors as the object of their affection? The veteran Gaullist already has form.When he was Commissioner for the Internal Market and Financial Services, Mr Barnier was dubbed ""the most dangerous man in Europe"" after taking on the banking sector and championing a cap on bankers' bonuses. But while he alarmed some in the City, and will probably do so again, he also won grudging respect as a tough but even-handed negotiator.He will need all those skills and more in his new role - chief Brexit negotiator at the European Commission. And having moved seamlessly between big jobs in Paris and Brussels - French foreign minister, Commissioner, MEP - he looks well prepared. ""Don't ask me to tell you what will be at the end of the road, we haven't begun to walk yet,"" he told a conference in Brussels last month. Mr Barnier will stick closely to the official EU position of ""no negotiation without notification"" - waiting for the UK to trigger Article 50 to start the formal process of withdrawal. But he's clearly eager to get going.""I am waiting to begin,"" he said. ""I will be ready tomorrow to negotiate, frankly speaking.""And he will bring with him an instinctive pro-European agenda, and a deep knowledge of the workings of the single market.His deputy as chief Brexit negotiator is a German trade expert, Sabine Weyand, adding to the impression that Mr Barnier will lead a team that means business.One of the biggest challenges he (and his boss Jean-Claude Juncker) faces, is to ensure that representatives of the big member states don't sideline him in the Brexit divorce negotiations.But Mr Barnier's long career in French politics means he could well have the ear of the Elysee Palace, especially if - as looks likely - a centre-right candidate wins the French presidency next year. The stakes are so high that there are bound to be some clashes.Mr Barnier has sparred with the UK's Minister for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, before, when the men both served as Europe ministers in the 1990s. It is another reminder that Michel Barnier is a politician first and foremost, rather than a bureaucrat. There have certainly been criticisms - a dash of vanity, a lack of attention to detail. His career has had plenty of downs as well as ups.But he will defend his European vision to the end, and the British government would do well not to underestimate him.At the height of the eurozone crisis, Mr Barnier always refused (politely) to do broadcast interviews in English.""One wrong word,"" he told me once with a smile, ""and we could move markets.""The next few years will be equally challenging."

Scotland voted 62% in favour of Remain.The conversation online was being driven overwhelmingly by pro-independence campaigners. But people who had supported ""Better Together"" during the Scottish referendum vote also spoke about the possibility of a break-away from the UK as a result of the vote over EU membership.  Perhaps the most significant was Scottish author JK Rowling who tweeted: ""Scotland will seek independence now. Cameron's legacy will be breaking up two unions. Neither needed to happen.""Many took to Twitter to express new or strengthened pro-independence feelings in the wake of the latest vote (Just as a reminder: a ""Yes"" vote in Scotland's 2014 referendum was for independence, while the winning ""No"" campaign backed staying in the UK).One old tweet from 2014's independence referendum gained new life on Friday.

2017-02-17,Blair: Public may rethink Brexit vote,https://web.archive.org//web/20170218020810/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38996179,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkTony Blair has said it is his ""mission"" to persuade Britons to ""rise up"" and change their minds on Brexit.Speaking in the City of London, the former prime minister claimed that people voted in the referendum ""without knowledge of the true terms of Brexit"".He urged ""a way out from the present rush over the cliff's edge"".Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith said the comments were arrogant and undemocratic but Lib Dem Nick Clegg said he ""agreed with every word"".Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage said Mr Blair was ""yesterday's man"" while Downing Street said it was ""absolutely committed"" to seeing Brexit through.Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson added: ""I urge the British people to rise up and turn off the TV next time Blair comes on with his condescending campaign.""Prime Minister Theresa May wants to trigger formal Brexit talks by the end of March - a move which was backed in the House of Commons by MPs last week.Mr Blair, who was UK prime minister between 1997 and 2007, used the speech to the pro-European campaign group Open Britain to argue that leaving the EU would be ""painful"" for Britain and Europe and the benefits would be ""largely illusory"". Mr Blair, who campaigned to remain in the EU, said that while he accepted that people voted to leave by 52% to 48%, he would recommend looking again at Brexit when ""we have a clear sense of where we're going"".Pressed on whether he thought there should be a second referendum, he said: ""All I'm saying is a very, very simple thing, that this is the beginning of the debate - that if a significant part of that 52% show real change of mind, however you measure it, we should have the opportunity to reconsider this decision. ""Whether you do it through another referendum or another method, that's a second order question. ""But this issue is the single most important decision this country has taken since the Second World War and debate can't now be shut down about it.""Analysis by political correspondent Tom BatemanTony Blair's warnings about the risks of Brexit might have made some viewers believe the referendum campaign was still being fought. But his central political point takes us onto new ground - that the voters could still change their minds about leaving the EU and Remainers should persuade them to do so. It will be seen by some as a call to arms - Tony Blair's Brexit insurrection. Brexiteer MPs were unsurprisingly excoriating, with the foreign secretary hinting at what Mr Blair's opponents see as his toxicity after the Iraq war. But importantly the former PM's speech raises a tactical question for Remainer MPs wondering what to do next: fight for Brexit on their terms or fight Brexit itself. In the absence of an effective opposition, he said pro-Europeans needed to build a ""movement "" reaching across party lines, he said, adding the institute he is launching would play its part in developing the arguments to rethink the country's position.""The debilitation of the Labour Party is the facilitator of Brexit. I hate to say that, but it is true.""While he fully accepted immigration was ""a substantial issue"", he said it had become the ""primary consideration"" for the government and suggested the public were more concerned about arrivals from outside the EU. Mr Blair has faced criticism in the past for his government's decision to allow people from Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic to work in Britain without restrictions, while most EU states imposed transitional controls to slow the rate of migration.Mr Blair stressed that the Conservative government only ""has bandwidth for only one thing - Brexit"", at the cost of the NHS, education, investment in communities, the rise in serious crime, the increased burden of social care and control of immigration.""This is a government for Brexit, of Brexit and dominated by Brexit, he said, adding that the issue was the government's ""waking thought, the daily grind, the meditation before sleep and the stuff of its dreams or nightmares"". Iain Duncan Smith, who was a prominent Leave campaigner, said Mr Blair had shown the political elite was completely out of touch with the British people.He compared Mr Blair returning to the political scene to the British horror comedy ""Shaun of the Dead"", with ""his hands outstretched to tell the British people they were too stupid to be able to understand what they were voting on"", adding that this ""is both arrogant and a form of bullying"".And Mr Farage described Mr Blair as a ""former heavyweight champion coming out of retirement"" who would ""end up on the canvas"".Kate Hoey, a prominent Leave campaigner and Labour former minister, told the BBC she did not think anyone would take Mr Blair's ""patronising"" opinion seriously.""I'm really quite sad that he doesn't feel that as a former prime minister - he's travelled all round the world, he's made himself lots of money - he's come back. Why doesn't he just now go and find himself a job?""But Alan Johnson, who led Labour's campaign to keep Britain in the EU - urged people to listen to the message, not the messenger. Stressing he would not rule out a second referendum, Mr Johnson said people are concerned that Britain could end up as a ""low tax, anything goes, race-to-the-bottom kind of country"" post Brexit.Supporters of leaving the EU argue it will free up the UK to trade better globally and give the government better control of immigration.Earlier this month, MPs overwhelmingly agreed, by 494 votes to 122, to let the government begin the UK's departure from the EU by voting for the Brexit bill.The Commons vote prompted splits in the Labour party. Despite calls by leader Jeremy Corbyn for his party to back the government, 52 MPs rebelled.Lib Dem attempts to amend the bill to include a provision for another referendum were defeated by 340 votes to 33."
2017-02-17,Business rates revolt gathers pace,https://web.archive.org//web/20170218020810/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-39000471,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkSome of the UK's biggest employers' groups have united in condemning the government's ""outrageous"" changes to business rates in England.They are most vexed about a clause they say could prevent firms appealing against rate rises, even if firms can prove they are wrong.Thirteen of them, including the British Retail Consortium and CBI, have written a letter calling for it to be dropped.But a government spokesman said the ""claims are simply false"".And Treasury Minister, David Gauke, told the BBC three in four businesses would not see an increase in their bill.Other signatories to the letter include the Federation of Small Businesses, Revo, the Association of Convenience Stores, the British Chambers of Commerce and the British Property Federation.The next business rates revaluation comes into effect on 1 April - the first for seven years - but the lobby groups said that tens of thousands of firms still face uncertainty over bills.Earlier this week, pubs and restaurants called for Chancellor Philip Hammond to dilute the impact of the business rate rises in his March Budget.Business rates are in effect the commercial version of council tax, and are paid on the rental value of the space that businesses occupy. The amount depends of the size of the property and what it's used for.The last time properties were valued, in 2010, almost half of businesses appealed against how much they were due to pay. The government wants to cut down on the number of these appeals. The trade groups say the government wants the right to dismiss appeals against incorrect valuations that are deemed to be within the bounds of ""reasonable professional judgement"", or margin of error.This allowable margin of error has not been disclosed, but experts say it could be as much as 15%. Rates in Scotland are also being reassessed. The Scottish Assessors' Association, which sets the rateable value, has been carrying out a revaluation of properties, the first since 2010. It is supposed to do this every five years but the 2015 revaluation was delayed by the Scottish government.Wales is also reassessing rateable values for business. Both will come into effect on April 1. Reality Check: Are there more winners than losers on business rates?Neil Whitham runs a fish and chip shop in St Ives and will be paying about £4,000 more per year under the new system. He says:""We will be passing on some of the costs to our customers unfortunately. Life is never easy if you wish to be successful but I don't believe [the rates system] is fair. ""I believe the losers are supplementing the winners - those who have had rate reductions.""I would look to have a fairer system. Our rent has increased 25% over five years - we can stomach that - but in the same period rates up 62% just seems totally unfair...with other business taken out of the system altogether.""[If your property is worth] up to £12,000 in rateable value - you pay no rates. From £12,000 to £15,000 there's a taper system, and as soon as you hit £15,000 you're on a full 100% rates.""They're creating a tiered system on the High Street. ""You and a neighbour may have similar shops, with maybe 25% difference in square footage and one is paying full rates, £15,000 or more. so that equates to about £7,500 per year, the slightly smaller shop is paying nothing at all.""John Webber, head of ratings at property company Colliers International, said the problem was that the ""margin for error"" allowed by the government was simply too wide.He told the BBC: ""Every rateable value is an opinion, so there will be a boundary of judgement there. The problem you're going to have is if you have a property with a rateable value of £100,000 and you think it should be £90,000, then that 10% tolerance is arguably still within the bounds of reasonable professional judgement.""Therefore, the list will not be altered and as the rating list lasts for five years potentially you will be paying, over a five year period, at least 10% more than you should do,"" Mr Webber adds.Helen Dickinson, director-general of the British Retail Consortium, told the BBC that the tax was ""no longer fit for purpose in the 21st Century"".She says that although technically, under new government rules, business owners will be able to appeal against a higher valuation, a clause states that even if rates are found to be unfair they can still stand if they lie within the bounds of ""reasonable professional judgement"". This somewhat vague wording is, she says, ""what everyone is upset about"".Jerry Schurder, head of business rates at property consultancy Gerald Eve and a supporter of the protest, said: ""The government's outrageous proposals... would force hard-pressed businesses to cough up an extra £1.9bn to pay for the Valuation Office Agency's (VOA) mistakes.""The way that trade bodies from a wide spectrum of industries have been motivated to unite against this clause shows the strength of feeling against what is a punitive and deeply unfair proposal,"" Mr Schurder said.But the government issued a strong rejection of the claims. A spokesman said: ""These claims are simply false. We are not preventing anyone from appealing their bills, or setting any margin of error for appeals being heard. ""We're reforming the appeals process to make it easier for businesses to check, challenge and appeal their bills, while at the same time generous business rate reliefs mean thousands more businesses are seeing a reduction.""He added that, once the changes come in to effect, 600,000 businesses will pay not rates at all."
2017-02-17,UK troops given Estonian strip club guide,https://web.archive.org//web/20170218020810/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38972213,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe Ministry of Defence (MoD) provided British soldiers with a guide to strip clubs in the Estonian capital, a freedom of information request to the department has revealed.The advice featured in a booklet titled ""Tallinn guide for friendly forces"", given to troops taking part in a Nato Steadfast Javelin training operation.The operation took place in May 2015. The MoD would not comment on the guide but said advice on ""staying safe"" was routinely given to troops while abroad.The BBC requested copies of various documents concerning the operation, also known as Exercise Hedgehog. In its response, the department provided the guide, which includes a section detailing three strip clubs in Tallinn. Lasso Baar was said to be a ""big strip bar with one of the prettiest dancers"" and Soho was identified as the ""biggest strip club in Estonia"". X Club was billed as ""the most professional strip club with various elements"".The guide also gave British troops further advice on what to expect at Estonian strip clubs.Troops were informed that ""all strip clubs offer private rooms for individual dances"", and that ""the average level of rolling tips to girls is 5 to 20 euros"". They were also advised ""to use cash in such places"".Asked if it was appropriate for the government to provide such material, a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Defence said: ""As you would expect, we routinely provide guidance to our people about staying safe while on deployment.""The department would not comment on who had produced the guide, how it had been distributed to troops, or whether it would be issued to troops serving in Estonia in future.The guide included other nightlife tips, such as pubs Mad Murphy's and Hell Hunt, or visiting the city's historic Old Town for a dash of Baltic culture.It also offered a warning on public drinking, saying that to avoid a police fine, ""when you want to drink spirits in the street it is wise to cover the bottles"".And it includes gift ideas for British troops. It suggests a visit to a shop called Bonbon Lingerie as a good place to pick up something special for wives and girlfriends. In terms of a bottle of something to bring home, it suggests Vana Tallinn or Old Tallinn liquor, of which the guide says, ""Finns just love it and some of them use it as a sleeping pill."" A spokesperson for the Estonian embassy in London said the Estonian government had not produced the guide.""According to the information received from the Estonian Defence Forces this is not an official document produced by or for the Government of Estonia."" Operation Steadfast Javelin was a major Nato training exercise, in which 13,000 troops and reserves defended positions against a simulated attack by land and air. "

You have got to engage with Russia, but you have got to engage in a very guarded way. You have got to beware of what they are up to.""There is no question that, when you look at Russian activity on the cyber front, when you look at what they are doing in the western Balkans, when you look at what has been happening in the Ukraine, you've got to be very, very cautious.""I think it is entirely right to have a dual track approach.""We don't want to get into a new Cold War. That's something London and Washington are completely at one on. But nor do we want Russian behaviour to continue as it is - and Rex Tillerson has been very clear about that."""
2017-02-17,Aslef members reject Southern deal,https://web.archive.org//web/20170218020810/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-38994965,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkAslef members have rejected a deal with Southern rail that would have ended a long-running industrial dispute.It had been arguing with parent firm, Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR), over driver-only operated (DOO) trains.Members of the drivers' union rejected the deal by 54.1% to 45.9%. The turnout was 72.7%.Under the proposed agreement, Southern would have been able to run trains without a guard or onboard supervisor under certain circumstances.Mick Whelan, general secretary of Aslef, said: ""We understand and support the decision arrived at democratically by our members and will now work to deliver a resolution in line with their expectations.""David Sidebottom, of independent watchdog Transport Focus, said: ""The hope that services would improve on Southern has now been dashed for their passengers.""They have had enough of the on-going industrial action. They have faced months of lost time, lost money and deep frustration at not being able to rely on the trains.""It is vital that all parties in this dispute get back around the table to bring the services back to normal as soon as possible.""Nick Brown, GTR's chief operating officer, said: ""Naturally we're saddened and hugely disappointed, as will be our passengers, with today's decision by drivers, particularly as the agreement carried the full support and recommendation of the Aslef leadership. ""We now need to understand the issues which led to this outcome and we'll be seeking to meet with the union as soon as possible to see how we can agree a way forward.""The dispute centres on Southern's decision to turn guards into on-board supervisors. In this role they would no longer be responsible for opening and closing carriage doors - this duty would become the responsibility of the driver.The dispute began in April when conductors - who are members of the RMT union - first took industrial action.Aslef members first walked out over the plans in December, leading to the cancellation of all Southern services.Aslef leaders announced they had reached a deal with GTR on 2 February following 11 days of talks.The RMT said at the time it was ""a shocking betrayal"", and it has now been rejected by Aslef members.A DfT spokesman said: ""It is disappointing that Aslef members have rejected the offer negotiated by their leaders at the TUC.""The union leadership must now return to talks and work with their members on a deal they can back.""  RMT leader Mick Cash said his union remained ""focused"" on the campaign to ""protect the safety of the travelling public and put access and safe operation before profits"".He added: ""[We] will now look to take that campaign into its next phase [by] working with our sister rail unions, the wider trade union movement and the passengers who use the railway.""RMT repeats the call to Southern to give the guarantee of a second, safety critical member of staff on their trains and to sit down with the unions in new talks around the issue of safe train despatch.""The RMT held separate talks with Southern managers earlier this week, which broke down without an agreement after three hours.On Wednesday, it announced further industrial action, saying conductors would walk out for 24 hours on 22 February. There we have it. Aslef drivers voted by a small majority to reject the deal their leaders had struck with Southern. That's not entirely surprising. Many saw the announcement of the deal as the end of the dispute, but that was wishful thinking. Once we saw the details it was clear some drivers wouldn't be happy. That deal gave a list of ""exceptional circumstances"" under which a train might run without its scheduled Onboard Supervisor, or OBS. Even assurances that those 'exceptional circumstances' didn't include RMT strike action proved insufficient. This wasn't just about solidarity with striking guards. Many drivers remain unconvinced that trains can be run safely without an OBS on board. What happens next depends on the reaction of key players. Southern moved quickly to offer fresh talks, and Aslef's Mick Whelan promised to ""work to deliver a resolution"" - with a relatively small 54.1% majority of drivers rejecting the deal, they'll hope it won't take too many tweaks to produce an acceptable deal. But commuters will be painfully aware of the disruption further strikes would cause. This dispute has run for months and there's no longer much cause to feel like it's coming to an end. "

The worst offenders include the US, Japan, Nigeria and Russia.The Foreign Office insists diplomats are not exempt from paying the charge.According to Transport for London (TfL), around three quarters of embassies in London do pay the charge, ""but there remains a stubborn minority who refuse to do so, despite our representations through diplomatic channels"".The US Embassy, which argues it is a tax and so covered by diplomatic immunity, owes the most, at more than £11.5m, while the Australian High Commission is among nations that owe the least, at £120.Top 10 congestion charge embassy debtors:Following legal advice, TfL's view is that the matter should be taken to the International Court of Justice in The Hague, but this needs government support, which is why it has been raised with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.Paul Cowperthwaite, TfL's general manager for congestion charging, said: ""We are clear that the congestion charge is a charge for a service and not a tax. This means that foreign diplomats are not exempt from paying it.""We continue to pursue all unpaid congestion charge fees and related penalty charge notices.""In October we wrote to the foreign secretary to ask him to take up the matter with the relevant embassies and the International Court of Justice.""Solution soughtTfL figures suggest that London-based embassies owe £105,258,715 for the period since the congestion charge was launched in 2003 and 31 December 2016 - up from £58m in 2012.A Foreign Office spokesman said: ""Our position is clear: there are no legal grounds to exempt diplomats from paying the London congestion charge. This is not a tax, and the majority of diplomatic missions in London recognise this and pay.""We are committed to working with TfL to find a solution to the problem of non-payment by some missions."" The congestion charge was introduced by former London mayor Ken Livingstone in February 2003, with the aim of reducing traffic congestion in and around the city centre between 07:00 and 18:00 Mondays to Fridays. The current charge is £11.50 per day."

Families spent an average of £72.70, or 14% of their budgets, on transport.We spent more on buying cars, but less on fuel, which became cheaper. The next biggest expense was housing.Excluding mortgages and council tax, we spent an average of £72.50 a week on our homes.That includes rent, heating, water and maintenance charges.The figures show big regional variations in spending on alcohol and tobacco.Households in Scotland spent an average of £8.90 a week on alcohol, compared to £7.80 in the UK as a whole.Scots drink considerably more spirits and liqueurs than other Britons, the figures show.Expenditure on cigarettes is even more varied.  Families in England spend just £2.90 a week on tobacco, while those in Wales spend £3, those in Scotland spend £4.90 and those in Northern Ireland spend £6.60.Families also continue to spend more on communications - with an average of £16 a week being spent on phones and postal services.In all, 95% of families in the UK own a mobile phone, the same proportion that have central heating."

He said: ""Suddenly I got a call from him and he apologised for not contacting me.""He said he'd failed his biology exams at university.  ""He said 'Spies are trying to break into my computer and I think spies are also in my computer'. Everything about him had changed.""Lord Monson says his son was assessed at hospital. He said: ""The nurse assessed Rupert and said that he really does need to go into a hospital and rang round all the hospitals and none of them would take him.  ""They said they didn't have any beds... the following day he was assessed by his local psychiatry team and they decided if Rupert just carried on taking the pills, then the psychosis would subside.""Lord Monson said his son killed himself a few days later.Jo Young, director of quality at Surrey and Borders Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, said: ""I am sorry for what happened and we are undertaking an internal investigation into Rupert's care and treatment with us. ""This will help us understand where we can learn lessons to further improve our support of people such as Rupert.""   Lord Monson has now lost two children in recent years after his eldest son, Alexander, died in police custody in Kenya in 2012 and said he is ""very angry"" with himself about what has happened.An inquest last year found that Alexander, aged 28, had died ""violently"" at the hands of the police.Since Rupert's death, Lord Monson has launched a campaign calling for skunk to be reclassified from a Class B drug to Class A. He said: ""In the old days, the psychoactive substance in cannabis was about 1.37% and now it's 22% with skunk... they have taken what is actually quite a decent plant and turned it into a monster.""Lord Monson also wants milder forms of cannabis to be legalised. He said the reaction to his campaign has been ""extraordinary"" and he is shocked by the amount of families who have come forward with similar drugs problems.  Lord Monson added: ""I know of three friends of mine... one whose son, because of skunk, tried to kill himself.  ""His brave mother thought: 'I'm going to try this stuff [skunk] and see what it's like'. And she says it was an absolute nightmare.""She said it was like confronting the devil himself when she looked in the mirror.  ""There's another one who's got long-term psychiatric problems and will probably never be the same again. ""And there's another one who's been dabbling with it at college and he's been suffering from suicidal tendencies and his mother is trying to find a safe place away from the college.""A Home Office spokesman said: ""This government has no plans to legalise cannabis. ""There is a substantial body of scientific and medical evidence to show that it is a harmful drug which can damage people's mental and physical health.""Details of organisations offering information and support with addiction or emotional distress are available at BBC Action Line, or you can call for free, at any time to hear recorded information for addiction on 0800 155 947 or emotional distress on 0800 066 066."
2017-02-17,Attacks on judges 'undermine law',https://web.archive.org//web/20170218020810/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-38986228,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe president of the UK's Supreme Court has criticised politicians for not doing enough to defend judges following a row over the Brexit legal challenge.Lord Neuberger said politicians did not speak out quickly or clearly enough and some media attacks had been unfair.He said unjustified attacks on the judiciary undermined the rule of law.After the government lost the Article 50 case at the High Court, a Daily Mail headline called the three judges in the case ""enemies of the people"".Lord Chancellor and justice minister Liz Truss said she was ""delighted"" that Lord Neuberger was ""proactively talking about the role of the judiciary in public."" She added: ""It is right that everyone understands the importance of its independence and the rule of law in a free society.""Lord Neuberger, who retires in September, was speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme a month after the Supreme Court ruled that only Parliament, not ministers, had the power to trigger the UK's exit from the EU because that was where laws were made.The Daily Mail's front page story was published when the government lost the first stage of the legal battle at the High Court last November.That story sparked a furious row with critics, including MPs from all parties, accusing Liz Truss, the lord chancellor and justice secretary, of not standing up for an independent judiciary.The Supreme Court, the final court of appeal in the UK for civil cases - and for criminal cases from England, Wales and Northern Ireland - hears cases of the greatest public or constitutional importance affecting the whole population. Its justices also sit as the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council and as such will occasionally hear appeals against the death penalty from Commonwealth countries.In an average year, the Supreme Court hears about 90 appeals and makes about 80 judgements on important issues of law.In his interview, Lord Neuberger did not single out any newspaper or politician, but said: ""We [judges in general] were certainly not well treated. One has to be careful about being critical of the press particularly as a lawyer or judge because our view of life is very different from that of the media.""I think some of what was said was undermining the rule of law.""Asked whether politicians had responded quickly enough to defend the judiciary and rule of law, Lord Neuberger said: ""They were certainly vocal enough quickly enough after our hearing [in the Supreme Court].""After the [High] Court hearing. I think they could have been quicker and clearer.  But we all learn by experience, whether politicians or judges. It's easy to be critical after the event. They were faced with an unexpected situation from which like all sensible people they learned.""Lord Neuberger said that undermining the judiciary also undermined the rule of law as judges were ""the ultimate guardians"" of it. ""The rule of law together with democracy is one of the two pillars on which our society is based,"" he added. ""And therefore if, without good reason, the media or anyone else undermines the judiciary that risks undermining our society.""The press and the media generally have a positive duty to keep an eye on things. But I think with that power comes the degree of responsibility.""By Clive Coleman, BBC Legal correspondent The country's judges were stung and hurt by the description of three of the most senior members of their ranks as 'enemies of the people'.  As a body they feel they cannot respond to such criticism publicly - judges must after all speak through their judgements alone, and the occasional public lecture.  Being dragged into the forum of public debate is seen as something that diminishes public confidence in their independence.  Whilst some senior retired judges such as the former Lord Chief Justice Lord Judge did speak out after the press coverage of the High Court Article 50 ruling, Lord Neuberger is the most senior serving judge to do so publicly.  He retires in September so perhaps he feels that the reins are off, or at least loosened.  His fellow judges will be quietly delighted that he has expressed his views on what they saw as an unfair attack on their independence and the rule of law… but they won't say that publicly.Kelvin MacKenzie, a former editor of the Sun, told the BBC Lord Neuberger was being ""overly sensitive"" and said judges ""cannot sit above argument or above criticism"".""[Newspapers] certainly haven't undermined the rule of law,"" he said. ""They have simply added to a debate going on outside the legal entity called the Supreme Court and there is nothing wrong with that. We call that free speech. ""Surely he is not indicating that free speech should have a limit in relation to the Supreme Court and a judgement [over Brexit] which had an enormous impact on a number of people? It is quite wrong.""The interview with Lord Neuberger comes on the same day the Supreme Court begins taking applications for new justices. As well as a new president to replace him, there is the need for two further justices after the retirement of Lord Toulson in 2016, and the upcoming retirement of Lord Clarke.The current bench is made up of one woman and 10 men, all white and from affluent backgrounds.On announcing his retirement last year, Lord Neuberger called for a diverse list of candidates to take the jobs. ""The higher echelons of the judiciary in the United Kingdom suffer from a marked lack of diversity and here I must admit the Supreme Court does not score at all well,"" he said. ""We have one white woman and 10 white men, and, although two of the 11 were not privately educated, none of us come from disadvantaged backgrounds.""Ms Truss welcomed the comments. She said: ""I am pleased to see him encouraging the widest pool of talent for the recruitment of three Supreme Court judges, which will enhance and strengthen our outstanding judiciary.""Applications will close on 10 March. There will then be shortlisting, interviews and consultation exercises, with the names of the new appointments expected to be announced in July. They will take up office at the beginning of the new legal year in October.Three more justices - Lord Mance, Lord Hughes and Lord Sumption - will retire before the end of 2018, as the statutory retirement age for judges is 70.

2017-02-17,UKIP urges 80% cut in foreign aid budget,https://web.archive.org//web/20170218020810/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38983952,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkUKIP is calling for an 80% cut in the foreign aid budget and for money to be spent instead on domestic services.It said much of the UK's spend, £12.5bn in 2015, was ineffective in alleviating poverty and left recipients worse off by perpetuating bad government. It wants spending to be stripped back to humanitarian and emergency aid only and a law guaranteeing 0.7% of national income be spent to be repealed.The government said the aid budget helped boost ""security and prosperity"".The UK's humanitarian spending has more than doubled since 2011.In 2015, the UK spent £1.26bn on humanitarian assistance around the world, including in war zones like Syria and Yemen, compared with £422m in 2011.It accounted for 16% of all bilateral aid - money which is directly spent in countries, regions and projects of the UK's choice - compared with 13% on governance and society, 12% on health and 12% on economic development. The government remains committed to the 0.7% target despite unease among some of its MPs about whether the aid budget, one of few areas to see an increase in spending in recent years, is providing value for money.Publishing a report on the UK's aid commitments on the eve of its spring conference, UKIP - a longstanding critic of UK policy - said spending should be pared back to £2.5bn a year focusing on emergency responses and eradicating disease.It claimed the existing budget was being ""abused"" to fund political advocacy and that multilateral spending through external partners, which accounted for 37% of total UK spending in 2015, incurred huge administrative costs.The 0.7% spending guarantee, enshrined in law in 2015, was based on ""inaccurate assumptions"" about how best to generate economic development, it said, with aid in some cases providing an obstacle to internal reform and trade innovation.""An increasing body of evidence suggests that more aid is not the best path to prosperity for developing countries but that more trade is,"" said the party's foreign aid spokeswoman Lisa Duffy. ""For too long, our government has prioritised ineffective aid spending over its basic obligations to British citizens.""But a spokeswoman for the Department for International Development said: ""The UK aid budget invests in our security and prosperity and is a key part of Global Britain's international leadership as we leave the EU.""All DfID programmes and partners are subject to rigorous checks and scrutiny to ensure we reach the world's poorest and most vulnerable, while also achieving the best value for UK taxpayers.""The government has said its assistance is saving thousands of lives in Syria, where the UK is the second largest single donor, and other conflict zones.Since 2010, the UK has re-focused its aid budget, with increased spending on countries such as Pakistan, Afghanistan, South Sudan and Somalia seen as critical to regional security and countering the spread of violent Islamic extremism. The BBC recently reported a new cross-Whitehall fund is being set up to help poor nations counter Russian influence and Islamic extremism, a project intended to better align aid spending with strategic national interests.

2017-02-17,US to Nato: Pay more or we'll do less,https://web.archive.org//web/20170218020810/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-38984947,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe new US defence secretary has told Nato members that Washington will ""moderate its commitment"" to the alliance if they do not increase their spending on defence.James Mattis's comments repeat President Donald Trump's demand that members raise their spending to meet a target of 2% of their GDP.Only five of the 27 countries do so.Earlier, Mr Mattis had hailed Nato as the ""fundamental bedrock"" of trans-Atlantic co-operation.According to a text of his remarks, Mr Mattis said at the Nato headquarters in Brussels: ""No longer can the American taxpayer carry a disproportionate share of the defence of Western values.""Americans cannot care more for your children's future security than you do,"" he added.Commentators said this was some of the strongest criticism in years to allies who have not hit their spending goals. Mr Mattis said members must show progress this year and adopt a plan to increase their contributions, even if slowly.Only the US, UK, Estonia, Greece and Poland currently meet the target, but others are on course to reach that level.""America will meet its responsibilities, but if your nations do not want to see America moderate its commitment to this alliance, each of your capitals needs to show support for our common defence,"" Mr Mattis said.The US defence chief added that investing in common defence was vital, and cited the threats that have emerged since 2014, such as the annexation of Crimea by Russia and the rise of so-called Islamic State in Syria and Iraq, on the southern border of member Turkey.General James Mattis, the former Nato insider, has delivered a thunderbolt aimed at the complacency of many of Washington's European allies. He has put them on notice. No longer will the US taxpayer bear a disproportionate share of the defence burden. If the Europeans do not dig more deeply into their pockets then the Trump administration ""will moderate its  commitment"" to Nato. Quite what this means is unclear. Surely the US would not weaken the alliance by limiting its own contributions? Well that's a proposition presumably that Gen Mattis believes will not be tested. He must hope that his warning, and a warning it was - however eloquent and hedged around with words of reassurance  - will force Nato allies to pay more. This debate matters now more than ever because there is a new species of US president with few of the predictable reflexes of previous occupants of the White House. There is also a resurgent Russian threat and a diverse array of worrying challenges on Nato's southern flank. The US has deployed thousands of troops and hundreds of vehicles to the alliance's eastern borders to reassure its allies. Now they are going to have to foot more of the bill.Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said alliance members were already increasing their contributions.And UK Defence Secretary, Michael Fallon, said he had urged countries to increase their spending, even if they could not meet the 2% target. ""An annual increase that we're asking them to commit to would at least demonstrate good faith.""The meeting was held amid concern over the new administration's ties with Russia and the resignation of Michael Flynn as US national security adviser.Mr Trump's comments, during his campaign, that the US might not defend allies who do not contribute their ""fair share"" to Nato, had worried many European nations, particularly those near Russia's border.He was critical of the Western military alliance, describing it as ""obsolete"".But Mr Mattis showed strong support for the alliance, hailing its ability to respond to security challenges. ""The alliance remains a fundamental bedrock for the United States and the trans-Atlantic community, bonded as we are together,"" he said."

The commissioners for England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland said they have ""deep concern"" after the decision. The government said it was committed to resettling 3,000 vulnerable children.A spokeswoman said resettling children under the Dubs amendment was ""just one way we area helping.""""We have also committed to resettle up to 3,000 vulnerable children and family members from the MENA [Middle East and North Africa] region and 20,000 Syrians by the end of this Parliament.""The Dubs amendment, designed by the Labour peer and former child refugee Lord Dubs, aimed to help some of the estimated 90,000 unaccompanied migrant children across Europe.The commissioners wrote that the number of children who had come in under the scheme so far ""falls significantly short of expectations"" and, as a signatory to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, the UK should ""play a far greater role"".The letter, signed by Anne Longfield, Children's Commissioner for England, and Tam Baillie, Sally Holland and Koulla Yiasouma - her counterparts in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - called on Home Secretary Amber Rudd to ""consider carefully the plight of the many thousands of lone child refugees in Europe who are currently at risk of exploitation and trafficking"".""We urge the Government to act humanely and responsibly, and to maintain a positive commitment to the Dubs scheme within a comprehensive strategy to safeguard unaccompanied child refugees within Europe,"" it read.The letter has received praise from Labour MP Yvette Cooper, who chairs the Home Affairs Select Committee.She said: ""This is a very serious response from the children's commissioners. They make clear that far from avoiding traffickers, by ditching the Dubs scheme, the government risks pushing more children back into the arms of smuggler gangs.""The government should listen to this call from the commissioners whose very purpose is to protect the welfare of vulnerable children and reopen the Dubs scheme now.""Ms Rudd has defended the decision in the House of Commons, saying it had been made after France raised concerns that the amendment could be encouraging more children to make the perilous journey to Europe.""I am clear that when working with my French counterparts they do not want us to indefinitely continue to accept children under the Dubs amendment because they specify, and I agree with them, that it acts as a draw,"" she said.""It acts as a pull. It encourages the people traffickers.""A statement from a government spokeswoman added: ""We have a proud history of offering protection to those who need it and children will continue to arrive in the UK from around the world through our other resettlement schemes and asylum system.""But critics, including the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev Justin Welby, and the head of the Catholic Church in England and Wales, Cardinal Vincent Nichols, have called for a reversal of the decision. A legal challenge against ending the scheme is expected to reach the High Court in May."

2017-02-17,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20170218020810/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThis article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide to the UK's vote to leave the European Union. It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 52% to 48%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who resigned on the day after losing the referendum. Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she says she will respect the will of the people. She has said ""Brexit means Brexit"" but there is still a lot of debate about what that will mean in practice especially on the two key issues of how British firms do business in the European Union and what curbs are brought in on the rights of European Union nationals to live and work in the UK. She set out more details of her negotiating hopes in her key speech on Brexit.The UK economy appears to have weathered the initial shock of the Brexit vote, although the value of the pound remains near a 30-year low, but opinion is sharply divided over the long-term effects of leaving the EU. Some major firms such as Easyjet and John Lewis have pointed out that the slump in sterling has increased their costs. Britain also lost its top AAA credit rating, meaning the cost of government borrowing will be higher. But share prices have recovered from a dramatic slump in value, with both the FTSE 100 and the broader FTSE 250 index, which includes more British-based businesses, trading higher than before the referendum. The Bank of England cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - a record low and the first cut since 2009 - after the vote and there has not been the economic slump or recession that some had predicted. The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it has to invoke an agreement called Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May has said she intends to trigger this process by the end of March 2017, meaning the UK will be expected to have left by the summer of 2019, depending on the precise timetable agreed during the negotiations. The government will also enact a Great Repeal Bill which will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. It is expected to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove.After a court battle, the UK's Supreme Court ruled in January that Parliament must be consulted before Article 50 is invoked. This is why a two line Brexit bill is currently making its way through Parliament. MPs have approved it after Labour MPs were told to support it. It is now heading to the House of Lords to be debated and voted on.Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These men - dubbed the Three Brexiteers - will play a central role in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although it will be Mrs May, as prime minister, who will have the final say. David Cameron's government did not do any emergency planning for Brexit ahead of the referendum and Mrs May has rejected calls to say what her negotiating goals are.Once Article 50 has been triggered, the UK will have two years to negotiate its withdrawal. But no one really knows how the Brexit process will work - Article 50 was only created in late 2009 and it has never been used. Former Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, now Chancellor, wanted Britain to remain in the EU, and he has suggested it could take up to six years for the UK to complete exit negotiations. The terms of Britain's exit will have to be agreed by 27 national parliaments, a process which could take some years, he has argued. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. The UK will continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making.Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Following Theresa May's Brexit recent speech we now know that the UK is not intending to stay in the EU's single market. Although there has been speculation for months about the issue, it would have meant the UK staying under the auspices of the European Court of Justice and having to allow unlimited EU immigration, under freedom of movement rules.Both sides want trade to continue after Brexit with the UK seeking a positive outcome for those who wish to trade goods and services"" - such as those in the City of London and wanting a ""comprehensive free trade deal"" giving the UK ""the greatest possible access"" to the single market. Mrs May says she wants the UK to reach a new customs union deal with the EU. A customs union is where countries agree not to impose tariffs on each others' goods and have a common tariff on goods coming in from elsewhere. The UK is currently part of the EU customs union but that stops the UK being able to do its own trade deals with other countries. Reality Check: How could customs union work?These terms have increasingly been used as debate focused on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people in order to maintain access to the EU single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result.The government has declined to give a firm guarantee about the status of EU nationals currently living in the UK, saying this is not possible without a reciprocal pledge from other EU members about the millions of British nationals living on the continent. EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, will be be able to stay, the chief civil servant at the Home Office has said. The rights of other EU nationals would be subject to negotiations on Brexit and the ""will of Parliament"", he added.A lot depends on the kind of deal the UK agrees with the EU. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions on EU nationals, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.Again, it depends on whether the UK government decides to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages. Citizens' Advice has reminded people their rights have not changed yet and asked anyone to contact them if they think they have been discriminated against following the Leave vote.Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested EU migrants who come to the UK as Brexit nears may not be given the right to stay. He has said there might have to be a cut-off point if there was a ""surge"" in new arrivals.People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote. The day-to-day spending impact is likely to be more significant. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it to remain at least 10% below where it was on 23 June, in the long term. This means imported goods will consequently get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have already been seen and the issue was most notably illustrated by the dispute between Tesco and Marmite's makers about whether prices would be put up or not in the stores.The latest UK inflation figures, for January, showed the CPI inflation rate rising to 1.8%, its highest level for two and a half years, with signs of more cost pressures set to feed through in the months to come.Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration.She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations. As mentioned above, the key issue is whether other EU nations will grant the UK access to the single market, if that is what it wants, while at the same time being allowed to restrict the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK.Mrs May has said she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. It is currently running at 330,000 a year, of which 184,000 are EU citizens, and 188,000 are from outside the EU - the figures include a 39,000 outflow of UK citizens.It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Liberal Democrats - who have just a handful of MPs - have vowed to halt Brexit and keep Britain in the EU if they were to win the next general election.Some commentators, including former House of Commons clerk Lord Lisvane, have argued that a further referendum would be needed to ratify whatever deal the UK hammers out with the EU, but there are few signs political leaders view this as a viable option.Yes. Theresa May has appeared keen to avoid a vote on her negotiating stance, to avoid having to give away her priorities, but Theresa May has said there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. It is worth mentioning that any deal also has to be agreed by the European Parliament - with British MEPs getting a chance to vote on it there.  While there could be limitations on British nationals' ability to live and work in EU countries, it seems unlikely they would want to deter tourists. There are many countries outside the European Economic Area, which includes the 28 EU nations plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway, that British citizens can visit for up to 90 days without needing a visa and it is possible that such arrangements could be negotiated with European countries.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. In theory, the government could, if it wanted, decide to change the colour, which is currently standardised for EU countries, says the BBC's Europe correspondent, Chris Morris.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketNo nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it is ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faces being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. A second independence referendum for the country is now ""highly likely"", she has said, although not in 2017. She has said she wants Scotland to stay in the single market and said Mrs May's decision to rule out the UK staying in the single market ""undoubtedly"" brings the referendum closer.Before his resignation Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said the impact in Northern Ireland would be ""very profound"" and that the whole island of Ireland should now be able to vote on reunification. But, speaking while she was still Northern Ireland Secretary, Theresa Villiers ruled out the call from Sinn Féin for a border poll, saying the circumstances in which one would be called did not exist. The land border is likely to be a key part of the Brexit talks. Theresa May said a priority for her would be negotiating a deal with the EU which allowed a common travel area between the UK and the Republic of Ireland.During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest. But his successor Theresa May has said she will keep it in place, at least for the current Parliament, which is due to last until 2020.So far there has been a cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. There are yet to be signs that rising inflation have worried the Bank of England  enough to consider raising interest rates.  But if that happened it would make mortgages and loans more expensive to repay - but would be good news for savers.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.Eurotunnel boss Jacques Gounon said last November the reintroduction of duty-free would be ""an incredible boost for my business"" but he later said  that remark had been ""light-hearted"". Erik Juul-Mortensen, president of the Tax Free World Association (TFWA) said after the referendum vote ""it is not possible to predict how Brexit will affect the duty free and travel retail industry, and it is wiser not to make assumptions about exactly what the impact will be.""  They are at the moment but no-one knows the longer term prospects for definite. The EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - is not an EU initiative. It was negotiated between countries within a group known as the European Economic Area, often simply referred to as the single market (plus Switzerland, which confusingly is not a member of the EEA, but has agreed access to the single market). Therefore, the future of Britons' EHIC cover could depend on whether the UK decided to sever ties with the EEA.Probably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report. In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two-thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.However, the UK government is committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, the UK government is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR. However, the EU has its own European Court of Justice, whose decisions are binding on EU institutions and member states.Its rulings have sometimes caused controversy in Britain and supporters of a Brexit have called for immediate legislation to curb its powers. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also cited sovereignty and democracy, and they wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Four of the biggest US banks have committed to helping maintain the City's position. But HSBC will move up to 1,000 jobs to Paris, the BBC understands. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Pest control firm Rentokil Initial says it could make £15m extra this year thanks to a weaker currency.Others are less optimistic. Hilary Jones, a director at UK cosmetics firm Lush said the company was ""terrified"" about the economic impact. She added that while the firm's Dorset factory would continue to produce goods for the UK market, products for the European market may be made at its new plant in Germany.Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After the Leave vote, the government will probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""As with most elements of the UK economy, not enough solid data has been published yet to accurately conclude the Brexit effect on house prices. Industry figures have pointed to ""uncertainty"" among buyers and sellers that could potentially change the housing market.So far, the most significant research has come from the respected Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which has published the conclusions of a survey of its members. This primarily records sentiment among surveyors.It found that house prices are expected to fall across the UK in the three months after the referendum vote. However, the dip in prices is only expected to persist over the 12 months from June in London and East Anglia, surveyors predict.House prices were already slowing in central London, owing to the fall-out from changes to stamp duty rules in April.Separate figures from property portal Rightmove suggested the average asking price of houses coming on to the market in England and Wales fell by 0.9%, or £2,647, in July compared with June. It said that agents had reported very few sales had fallen through as a result of the vote.Many potential first-time buyers would welcome a fall in house prices, with ownership among the young falling owing to affordability concerns. Investors in property, or those who have paid off a mortgage and hope to leave homes as inheritance would be unhappy with a long-term reduction in value.  Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law following the decision to leave the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" will not necessarily disappear overnight - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU means the UK will not be part of TTIP. It will have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Former Labour health secretary Lord Owen has said that because of TTIP (see answer above) the only way to protect the NHS from further privatisation was to get out of the EU."

Mr Snell is a member and former leader of Newcastle-under-Lyme Council, who campaigned for a Remain vote in the EU referendum.UKIP, which narrowly beat the Conservatives into second place in the 2015 general election, is fielding its leader, Paul Nuttall, as its candidate. The MEP was born in Bootle, where he has stood in the last three general elections.The Tories have chosen 25-year-old city councillor Jack Brereton. He is the deputy leader of the Conservative Group in the council's ruling coalition, where he is also the Cabinet member for Regeneration, Transport and Heritage. The Green Party has picked Adam Colclough as their candidate, with Zulfiqar Ali standing for the Liberal Democrats.See below for a full list of candidates.The successful Liberal Democrat by-election campaign in Richmond Park in December was seen as a result of the party making Brexit a key issue in what was a very Remain constituency.The wider Stoke area (which includes Stoke Central) voted strongly to Leave in June's referendum so the question is how much of an impact Brexit is likely to have. Since being created for the 1950 general election, Stoke Central has always returned Labour MPs.It has traditionally been seen as rock solid Labour territory and Mr Hunt won in 2015 by a 5,179 margin.Labour's majority has been decreasing sharply in recent years, from 49.5% in 1997 to 16.7% in 2015.Stoke-on-Trent Central covers the administrative centre of the six Potteries towns: Burslem, Fenton, Hanley, Longton, Stoke-upon-Trent and Tunstall.As BBC Midlands political editor Patrick Burns notes, this may be the last time the seat is contested.""For all its rich history and industrial heritage, it's set to be scrapped under proposed Parliamentary boundary changes which would reduce Stoke's present three seats to two,"" he says.""And with (Labour MPs) Ruth Smeeth and Rob Flello apparently in no mood to relinquish their neighbouring seats, it's no wonder that this is being unofficially dubbed as a job for three years.""Mr Nuttall has admitted a previous claim that he lost ""close personal friends"" in the Hillsborough disaster was wrong.The UKIP candidate apologised and said the quotes on his website from 2011 were ""wrong"" and had been taken down.There was also a clash with Labour over whether Mr Nuttall was actually living in the Stoke house registered as his address on nomination papers. UKIP later said he had to leave the house for safety reasons after the address was circulated on social media.Mr Snell, meanwhile, has apologised after some of his old tweets about people appearing on TV shows have re-emerged, including a description of panellists on ITV's Loose Women as ""squabbling sour-faced ladies"" and remarks about Janet Street-Porter and a woman on the BBC's The Apprentice.The Labour candidate also previously posted disparaging remarks about his party's current leader Jeremy Corbyn and Brexit.Here is a list of the candidates, in alphabetical order by surname:Polls open at 07:00 GMT on 23 February and close at 22:00 GMT."

The councillor and former doctor and ambulance driver was chosen from an all-woman shortlist.Up against her for the Conservatives is Trudy Harrison, who lives in the village of Bootle and was a parish councillor for a number of years.UKIP has chosen its 2015 general election candidate, Fiona Mills.The Liberal Democrats have chosen Rebecca Hanson and the Green Party Jack Lenox as their candidates. There are also two independent candidates - Michael Guest and Roy Ivinson.Copeland and its predecessor Whitehaven have been Labour since 1935, but the seat has become more marginal in recent years.Mr Reed, who had been an MP since 2005, held the seat by 2,564 votes from the Conservatives in 2015, with UKIP another 8,038 votes behind in third.The Tories are bidding to become the first governing party to make a by-election gain - not including a 1982 poll triggered by a defecting Labour MP - since 1960.With nearly 11,000 people employed at Sellafield, thousands more in the supply chain and a new power plant proposed in the constituency, the nuclear industry has been a key issue.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's previous opposition to new nuclear power stations has been highlighted by his opponents, although the Labour leader has since given his backing for the £10bn Moorside plant, due to open in 2024.Doubts were raised over the project after Toshiba, which has a 60% share in NuGen, the firm behind the scheme, sustained heavy losses.During a visit to the constituency, Prime Minister Theresa May was asked about union calls for the government to guarantee the investment to ensure the project goes ahead, saying her party ""recognises the importance"" of the nuclear industry.The prime minister also faced questions about the future of Whitehaven's West Cumberland Hospital, with Labour campaigning hard on the future of the maternity unit amid concerns consultant-led services could be moved elsewhere.A key link road, the A595, has also been inspected by both Transport Secretary, Chris Grayling and his Labour counterpart, Andy McDonald, with campaigners calling for urgent improvements to be made.Polls will be open from 07:00 GMT on 23 February until 22:00 BST, with the result expected overnight."
2017-02-17,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20170218020810/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-39007019,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkFormer Prime Minister Tony Blair has launched a campaign to try to persuade the British people to change their minds about leaving the European Union. It comes just weeks before the government intends to trigger the departure mechanism. In a speech in London, he said that he respected the will of the people, but voters hadn't been given details about the terms on which Britain would exit the EU. Mr Blair argued that what he called the ""cost"" of Brexit was only now becoming clear. The referendum vote, he said, was based on ""imperfect knowledge"" which would now become ""informed knowledge"".It's true that we don't yet know the details of the UK's future relationship with the rest of the EU - that will depend on the deal that is negotiated - but lots was said during the referendum campaign about what Brexit would mean in more general terms. In particular, campaigners from both sides said leaving the EU would entail leaving the single market.Mr Blair suggested that immigration was the main issue that propelled Leave to victory in the referendum campaign. But, he argued, the effect of quitting would probably have only a modest impact on overall immigration levels.He pointed out that just over half of migration into the UK comes from outside the EU. That's confirmed by official statistics from the ONS. In the year to June 2016 net migration - the difference between the number of people who arrived and the number of people who left - was 196,000 from outside the EU, compared with 189,000 from inside the EU.The same is true for the gross migration statistics - ie just looking at how many citizens from different parts of the world arrived in the UK.Again, there were slightly more from outside the EU (289,000) than from inside (284,000) along with a smaller number of British citizens returning to live in the UK (77,000). And only an estimated 82,000 or 12.6% of the 650,000 total were EU citizens who arrived looking for work.Theresa May has ruled out introducing a points-based migration system but the government hasn't published details of what it does want to implement. If the new system continues to allow in EU migrants with job offers, as well as students and people coming to join spouses, then Mr Blair's 12% would be, broadly speaking, correct. There could be a bigger impact if the government opts for a capped number of work permits. But about half of total migration will be unaffected no matter what arrangements are made with the EU.This isn't really a fair quotation. It's a reference to an interview given by Philip Hammond on ITV's Peston on Sunday on 26 June.Mr Hammond said: ""I believe it's essential that we protect our access to the single European market. Whether we like it or not, our economy, over 40 years, has become shaped by that access, and to lose that access now would be catastrophic.""But note that he was talking about access to the single market. That's not the same as membership. You don't have to be a member of the single market to have access to it, although the level of access that Britain would have after leaving the single market would depend on what trade relationship was negotiated.It's true that the pound has fallen against the dollar and the euro since the referendum, although not by quite as much as Mr Blair said. It has recovered from its lowest point. Against the dollar, the pound is currently down about 16% compared with its pre-referendum level. Against the euro, it's about 10.5% down.It's also worth noting that the pound/euro exchange rate was at a similar level to now between 2009 and the middle of 2011, so it's hardly unprecedented. Against the dollar, though, the pound has hit multi-decade lows in recent months."
2017-02-17,'Block him out',https://web.archive.org//web/20170218020810/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38096514,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkIf Jenny ever gets married, there will be no dad walking her down the aisle and, if she gets her way, no mention of him on her marriage certificate either.This is because, according to the twenty-something professional, the man who sexually abused her for 18 months from the age of seven ""lost any right to be called my father"".Despite his horrific betrayal of the relationship between father and daughter, the current law gives the option for only his name and occupation to be recorded on her future marriage certificate - but not that of her mother ""who has been mum and dad all wrapped up in one"".This system, of recording only the names of the father of the bride and groom on the certificate, dates back to the early years of Queen Victoria's reign. While either party can ask for a line to be put through that box if they have never known their father or been brought up by a step-father, it's an inequality many people like Jenny feel should be addressed.It is also an issue that has provoked anger among MPs from all parties, who have spent several years attempting to bring about a change in the law to allow both parents to have their names and occupations recorded.Their campaign was given a boost when a petition on Change.org, calling for mothers' names to be added to marriage certificates, collected 70,600 signatures in January 2014. The petition said ""marriage should not be seen as a business transaction between the father of the bride and the father of the groom"".Former Prime Minister David Cameron said later that year that he would address this ""inequality in marriage"", adding that the exclusion of mothers' names from marriage registers in England and Wales did ""not reflect modern Britain"".Mr Cameron was gone from Downing Street before any action was taken and it now seems that Conservative MP Edward Argar's Registration of Marriage Bill is the most likely vehicle to overturn the law.A brief history of marriage:His bill, which would update the Marriage Act of 1949, would move the solely paper-based system to a central electronic register online, which would allow the mother's name to be included.It would also bring England and Wales into line with the rest of the UK. In Scotland and Northern Ireland, couples are asked to give the names of both parents on marriage documentation. The same applies for those entering a civil partnership.Similar attempts by Labour and Conservative MPs to change the law fell in 2015 after failing to get ministers' support. Labour frontbencher Christina Rees' private member's bill focused on the narrow point about putting the mother on the certificate. Former Conservative cabinet minister Dame Caroline Spelman's bill wanted marriages listed in a single electronic register instead of in marriage register books.Former home office minister Richard Harrington said at the time ""a combination"" of the two bills ""could deal with things quickly"".Unlike his predecessors', Mr Argar's bill - which is more like Dame Caroline's attempt - has succeeded in getting government backing because it will create a more secure system for keeping marriage records.""The whole point of this bill is the mothers and fathers of the bride and groom will be registered,"" said the Charnwood MP. ""In the great scheme of things it's a minor change, but it's symbolically very important for a large number of people who want a recognition of the role their mother played in their upbringing.""He added: ""It will also give victims of abuse, children of single mothers or errant fathers, the choice over whether to include their mother's names and not their father's.""You will see virtually no outward change in the form of the marriage ceremony, just in the manner that things are recorded. By moving to an online schedule system, we can easily amend the paper documentation - and it's more secure because it doesn't rely on the old parish register that is at risk of theft from the village church.""The church is supportive of the move, and over time it will save the taxpayer millions of pounds in administrative costs.""The bill is set to return to the Commons for its detailed committee stage after the half-term recess, and Mr Argar is hopeful it will receive Royal Assent - and so become law - by the summer.A spokesman for the Home Office said it wanted to see mothers' names recorded on marriage certificates ""as soon as possible"".Mum's done everythingFor Jenny, whose name has been changed to protect her identity, the law change cannot come soon enough. ""My dad's a rapist and he abused me and my sisters, so I never want any reference to him appearing on anything about my future,"" she said. ""He has no right to that - he lost that right many years ago.""I was only seven when the attacks started, and my siblings were much younger. It ended after I told my mother when I was eight and a half.""I've tried to block out what he did to me. ""I have a partner and I'm sure we will get married eventually, but I don't want my father involved in any way.  I'd only want my mum's name on the marriage certificate because as far as I'm concerned she's done everything for us."""

Sir Peter de la Mare, the Speaker or ""Prolocutor"" of the Good Parliament in April 1376 opened the first day with a long address on the shortcomings of the Crown - military failures, financial and moral corruption. Royal favourites were imprisoned. King Edward III's mistress, Alice Perrers, was condemned to ""seclusion"".  But by the autumn, royalty had fought back. The Parliament was dissolved and most of its work was undone. The King's mistress was back at Court.  The King's son, John of Gaunt, had Sir Peter de la Mare thrown in jail. And the new Speaker was John of Gaunt's own steward, the far more biddable Sir Thomas Huntingford.Until the 17th Century, the Speaker's loyalty was to the Crown rather than to MPs.  But they were often blamed if they delivered news the monarch didn't like.  It could be a dangerous job: seven Speakers were beheaded between 1394 and 1535.  That's why even today a new Speaker traditionally makes a show of being dragged reluctantly to the Chair.Staying on the right side of the Crown was especially tricky during the turmoil of the Wars of the Roses, when it was hard to be sure who would end up being the King.  One Speaker, John Wenlock, tried to hedge his bets by fighting on the side of both the Yorkists and the Lancastrians.   It didn't work out well. He was killed at the Battle of Tewkesbury, allegedly by his own commander who blamed Wenlock's general indecisiveness for the defeat. Gradually, the Speaker's role became one of representing Parliament, rather than the monarch. When Charles I came in person to the Commons on 4 January 1642 to arrest five MPs for treason, Speaker William Lenthall refused to reveal where they were. Hitherto seen as a rather timorous chap, this was his moment. He fell to his knees, but told the King: ""May it please your Majesty, I have neither eyes to see nor tongue to speak in this place but as the House is pleased to direct me, whose servant I am here.""  The King was humiliated and left without the men he'd come for.John Bercow is being criticised by some MPs today for - in their view - failing to be impartial on political issues. But the Speaker's impartiality is a relatively modern notion. In fact, some Speakers held other government offices at the same time.  They could take part in some debates and vote, when they weren't actually presiding over business. Arthur Onslow, who had the job for more than 30 years, began to change that. In fact, he used to boast of his impartiality - to the great irritation and disappointment of the Prime Minister, Sir Robert Walpole, who'd helped him to the job.It wasn't until the Victorian era that our current ideas of impartiality became the norm - though Irish Nationalists in the 1880s felt that Speaker Henry Brand stepped over the line in helping to put down their disruption in the Commons over Irish Home rule. In January 1881, they prolonged debate for 41 hours.  There were disorderly scenes. Irish MPs defied the Chair. And so, Speaker Brand helped the government to invent new procedures, still in use today, to cut the debate short on the Coercion Bill for Ireland.In spite of the controversies, it's almost unprecedented to sack a Speaker. Although in recent times, Michael Martin, was pressured into resigning, the only other one to be ousted forcibly was Sir John Trevor in 1695, who'd been found guilty of accepting a £1,000 bribe.  He also had the disadvantage of being so cross-eyed that MPs couldn't tell if he was giving them the nod to speak, or looking at someone else.And of course, for any MP who tries to oust a Speaker but fails, there's a big risk that in future debates, the Speaker seems strangely unable to see them at all, when they're hoping to be called."
2017-02-17,They said what?,https://web.archive.org//web/20170218020810/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38980742,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkIt was Abraham Lincoln's 208th birthday last weekend. The US Republican Party's social media feeds honoured the 16th president by sharing a picture of his iconic memorial in Washington DC, with an inspiring quote laid over the top. ""In the end, it's not the years in your life that counts, it's the life in your years,"" was the message on Twitter and Instagram, also shared by President Trump.There was just one problem: the words have been attributed to Lincoln many times over the years, but there is no evidence he ever said them. The post has since been deleted.It was the latest example of a growing modern phenomenon, the fake political quote.Some have said ""fake news"" could have swung the outcome of November's US presidential election. Bogus stories like ""Pope Francis Shocks World, Endorses Donald Trump for President"" were extensively shared online.Made up quotes are perhaps more benign than fictitious news stories with a clear political agenda. But they still raise concerns, says James Ball of Buzzfeed News, who is writing a book about ""post-truth"" politics.""If enough people share and believe these fake quotes, then they can contribute to the polarisation of politics, making each side think less of the other, especially as many partisans think fake news is a problem which affects primarily (or only) their opponents.""These fake quotes don't just come from right-wing politicians and activists. In the days after the US election, a quote supposedly taken from a 1998 Donald Trump interview went viral online. ""If I were to run, I'd run as a Republican. They're the dumbest group of voters in the country. They believe anything on Fox News. I could lie and they'd still eat it up,"" the quote said.It seemed too obnoxious to be true - and it was.Fake George Orwell quotes are a specialty in left-wing social media circles. One example is ""during times of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act."" There is no evidence the 1984 author ever said these words, but social media is awash with shareable pictures of them alongside Orwell's monochrome face.So how do bogus quotes like this get into circulation?""Sometimes people just want new followers or shares on social media, and either invent a quote or (naively or otherwise) lift a questionable one,"" says James Ball. ""Others invent quotes as a hoax or parody to show up people they disagree with, or to fire up their own side - or simply to make money from adverts on fake news sites.""The internet means fake quotes can spread very quickly. ""It's easier to fabricate things than it is to debunk them,"" says Rasmus Nielsen, director of research at the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at the University of Oxford. ""As communication gets easier, there is going to be more and more of this stuff floating about online.""Jenni Sargent runs First Draft News, which is working with social media companies and news organisations to look at innovative solutions to the problem.""People are experimenting with the most engaging way to spread false information,"" she says. She wants news websites to come up with entertaining ways of debunking fake facts and quotes.A blue tick next to a name on Twitter tells you the account has been verified as ""authentic"". Sargent wants to come up with ways to highlight unreliable sources, ""like the opposite of a blue tick"".Facebook is introducing tools for German users to flag false stories ahead of that country's parliamentary elections in the autumn. Third-party fact checkers would mark unreliable stories as ""disputed"".The BBC has also said it will fact check deliberately misleading stories ""masquerading as news"".   British MP Damian Collins is chairing a parliamentary inquiry into these issues, which will look at the possibility of news websites having ""verified"" markers. Collins thinks fake quotes attributed to electoral candidates could end up ""distorting the democratic process"".Often verifying quotes is simply a case of rigorously searching through publicly available information, says Kim LaCapria, who works for rumour-busting website Snopes. The volume of dubious content online is greater than ever before, but verification can be easier because far more information is digitised, she says. ""It's actually pretty easy for average social media users to fact check online.""Her job involves looking at outright fake quotes, but also real quotes presented in a misleading way. For example, Al Gore has been ridiculed for claiming he ""invented the internet"". The former vice president did once say ""I took the initiative in creating the Internet,"" but taken in full context, that line seems rather more modest.We are less likely to expend energy verifying a quote which confirms our political beliefs, says LaCapria, an effect which psychologists call confirmation bias.Whether a fake quote comes from the left or the right, it tends to have one common feature, she says. ""It validates our preconceived beliefs or feelings, and that's often proffered as a valid reason to spread it."""
2017-02-17,Race to reform,https://web.archive.org//web/20170218020810/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-38970265,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThere is a theory in politics that times of upheaval and uncertainty present opportunities as well as problems.It's best summed up in the saying that you should never let a good crisis go to waste - an aphorism so seductive that it has been attributed to all the usual historical suspects, from Machiavelli to Winston Churchill.It is perhaps in this spirit that the European Parliament has been debating how the EU is going to work in future, in the looming shadow of Brexit. The UK's vote to leave the EU, last June, came as a seismic shock to most MEPs. And many are quite open in their view that it amounts to a self-destructive decision by the British to uncouple themselves from one of modern history's primary drivers of peace and prosperity.British Eurosceptics of course would cast the Brexit vote in an entirely different light, and now foresee a future in which the UK will be free to make its fortune - and make its own new global trading relationships - unfettered from the dead hand of stifling Brussels bureaucracy.It will be years of course - perhaps many years - before we know who is on the right side of that debate.But one consequence of Brexit is already with us - the EU is now free to debate how it might work in the future without any input from the UK.In theory that should leave Europe's federalists freer to dream than they have been in the past. Britain's voice has generally been raised to question the wisdom and value of further integration that would give EU institutions greater powers at the expense of individual national governments. You would expect such dreams to be articulated best by Guy Verhofstadt - the former prime minister of Belgium, who now leads the liberal bloc in the European Parliament and who will represent that body in Brexit negotiations.In the debate on future reform Mr Verhofstadt said: ""The union is in crisis. The European Union doesn't have much friends: not at home, not abroad. ""The Union does not deliver anymore. Rather than to talk about an 'ever closer union', we have a union of 'too little, too late'. ""That's why people are angry: they see all these European institutions, all these summits, all these empty words, but they don't see enough results.""Mr Verhofstadt has a long list of suggested fixes for this continental malaise, including reducing or ending the right of individual members to opt out of collective decisions - something no British government would ever have countenanced. He has other ideas for how the EU should respond to Brexit too - including moving out of London the headquarters of two EU agencies: the European Banking Authority and the European Medicines Agency.But for now, at least, it seems radical visions for reform will be quietly kicked into touch.The vice-president of the EU Commission, Frans Timmermans, politely welcomed the display of ""vision"" in the proposals, but noted that most of the suggestions would require EU treaty change. He said simply: ""We have to acknowledge that treaty change is not on the top of the political agenda now, in member states in particular.""There are plenty of true believers in the European project who would see in the Verhofstadt proposals the start of a kind of counter-revolution against events which have dismayed them - including Brexit, the US election of Donald Trump and the strong opinion poll showing of insurgent parties in a number of European countries.Populist challenge brings Europe to crossroadsBrexit: All you need to knowBut for now a more cautious and pragmatic approach will prevail - partly because there is a general sense in Strasbourg and Brussels that the European institutions will have enough on their plates negotiating Brexit, without kicking off a parallel process of structural reform which would also take years.That takes us back to the idea that every crisis is an opportunity that shouldn't go to waste.There are, no doubt, those in Strasbourg who take that view - but it seems for the moment they are outweighed by those who feel that when you find yourself in the middle of a crisis - as they would see Brexit - the smartest course of action is to fix the crisis first and worry about the future later."

2017-02-17,Meet the EU's chief Brexit negotiator,https://web.archive.org//web/20170218020810/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37542204,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe British papers love a French villain at the heart of the EU.Is Michel Barnier about to succeed Jacques Delors as the object of their affection? The veteran Gaullist already has form.When he was Commissioner for the Internal Market and Financial Services, Mr Barnier was dubbed ""the most dangerous man in Europe"" after taking on the banking sector and championing a cap on bankers' bonuses. But while he alarmed some in the City, and will probably do so again, he also won grudging respect as a tough but even-handed negotiator.He will need all those skills and more in his new role - chief Brexit negotiator at the European Commission. And having moved seamlessly between big jobs in Paris and Brussels - French foreign minister, Commissioner, MEP - he looks well prepared. ""Don't ask me to tell you what will be at the end of the road, we haven't begun to walk yet,"" he told a conference in Brussels last month. Mr Barnier will stick closely to the official EU position of ""no negotiation without notification"" - waiting for the UK to trigger Article 50 to start the formal process of withdrawal. But he's clearly eager to get going.""I am waiting to begin,"" he said. ""I will be ready tomorrow to negotiate, frankly speaking.""And he will bring with him an instinctive pro-European agenda, and a deep knowledge of the workings of the single market.His deputy as chief Brexit negotiator is a German trade expert, Sabine Weyand, adding to the impression that Mr Barnier will lead a team that means business.One of the biggest challenges he (and his boss Jean-Claude Juncker) faces, is to ensure that representatives of the big member states don't sideline him in the Brexit divorce negotiations.But Mr Barnier's long career in French politics means he could well have the ear of the Elysee Palace, especially if - as looks likely - a centre-right candidate wins the French presidency next year. The stakes are so high that there are bound to be some clashes.Mr Barnier has sparred with the UK's Minister for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, before, when the men both served as Europe ministers in the 1990s. It is another reminder that Michel Barnier is a politician first and foremost, rather than a bureaucrat. There have certainly been criticisms - a dash of vanity, a lack of attention to detail. His career has had plenty of downs as well as ups.But he will defend his European vision to the end, and the British government would do well not to underestimate him.At the height of the eurozone crisis, Mr Barnier always refused (politely) to do broadcast interviews in English.""One wrong word,"" he told me once with a smile, ""and we could move markets.""The next few years will be equally challenging."

Scotland voted 62% in favour of Remain.The conversation online was being driven overwhelmingly by pro-independence campaigners. But people who had supported ""Better Together"" during the Scottish referendum vote also spoke about the possibility of a break-away from the UK as a result of the vote over EU membership.  Perhaps the most significant was Scottish author JK Rowling who tweeted: ""Scotland will seek independence now. Cameron's legacy will be breaking up two unions. Neither needed to happen.""Many took to Twitter to express new or strengthened pro-independence feelings in the wake of the latest vote (Just as a reminder: a ""Yes"" vote in Scotland's 2014 referendum was for independence, while the winning ""No"" campaign backed staying in the UK).One old tweet from 2014's independence referendum gained new life on Friday.

2017-02-18,Business rates 'need fundamental reform',https://web.archive.org//web/20170219033155/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-39018536,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkSainsbury's chief executive has called for ""fundamental reforms"" to business rates amid concerns hikes could spark a raft of High Street store closures.Mike Coupe said the set-up pegged to property valuations was ""archaic"" and ignored the rise of online shops based in out-of-town warehouses.His comments came after business groups urged ministers to lessen the impact of April's revaluation in England.The government says the majority of firms will pay the same or less.  Properties concentrated in the South East of England and urban centres are said to be disproportionately impacted by the first revaluation since 2010, with retailers in some areas facing rises of up to 400%.There is a similar debate taking place in Scotland and Wales where rates are also being reassessed after April.Reality Check: Are there more winners than losers on business rates?Mr Coupe, the boss of the UK's second-largest supermarket chain, urged the government to undertake a wide-ranging review of the way businesses are taxed, highlighting changes in retailing culture.Mr Coupe said: ""The way it currently stands, there is an advantage for those without bricks and mortar operations, so there's a strong case for a level playing field in business rates and taxation more generally.""Businesses like ours with lots of property and employees face a bigger burden than others.""Referring to the revaluation plans, he said: ""As it stands, we could see High Streets face serious challenges and ultimately more closures. It could impact investment in places that most need it, in areas of the country where there is already a marginal call on investment.""Rates are calculated by multiplying the rateable value of a property by a multiplier set by the government. But as property values change over time, rateable values need to be reassessed periodically - usually every five years.However, this update to property values is two years behind schedule, making it a harder pill to swallow in areas where the price of real estate has been rising. According to analysts, Sainsbury's will see its annual rates rise to £500m, up from £483m, while internet giant Amazon will see its bill cut.Pubs, NHS hospitals and hotels in some areas are also said to be facing increases in their business rates.On Friday, business groups - including the British Retail Consortium and the CBI - signed a letter urging the government to drop the revaluation plans. Pubs and restaurants have also called on the chancellor to dilute the impact of the changes by providing more transitional relief for the sector.Meanwhile, the Sunday Telegraph has reported that ministers considered extra financial support to ease the impact of business rates before the general election in 2015.According to the paper, the Department for Communities and Local Government worked with the Treasury to protect the sector, but eventually decided to adopt more modest reforms.A government spokesman said: ""Nearly three quarters of businesses will see a fall, or no change, in their business rates as a result of the revaluation.""The generous reliefs we are introducing mean that 600,000 small businesses are paying no rates at all - something we're making permanent so they never pay these bills again.""Across the country, there's also a £3.6bn scheme to support companies affected by the business rates revaluation."""

Prisons with recruitment issues are being targeted.Jails have been hit by staff strikes and rising violence in recent months. A union welcomed the rise but said ministers were ""papering over cracks"".The Prison Officers Association (POA) added that the government was dealing with ""crisis management on a daily basis"".The pay increase applies to ""band 3"" staff, who make up the majority of front-line officers.Prisons in London and the south-east, including Wormwood Scrubs, Pentonville, Belmarsh and Whitemoor, were chosen as they find it harder to recruit.The Ministry of Justice said ""thousands"" of employees would benefit. The £12m package is an attempt to boost falling prison officer numbers.On Thursday, it was revealed that, in 2016, the number of front-line staff in England and Wales fell by 347 (1.9%) to 17,888.The leaving rate was almost 9% - almost double the level of four years earlier.Steve Gillan, the general secretary of the POA, said it had been told about the increase on Tuesday, and that ""not a lot of thought"" had gone into the rise.""We welcome any new money,"" he said, ""but we're a national service and this only applies to 31 prisons [out of more than 100 in England and Wales].""It doesn't apply to the operational support grades, so the lowest-paid people in the service are getting nothing.

""The prisoners are in control, not the staff.""In November a government White Paper announced an extra 2,500 prison officers would be in place by the end of 2018.That was on top of an extra 400 officers, to be in place by March this year.The Ministry of Justice said it was ""on track"" to meet that target, with 389 job offers made to new recruits.Justice Secretary Liz Truss said: ""Prison officers do a challenging and demanding job day in and day out.

I hate to say that, but it is true,"" he said.Mr Corbyn told reporters at the party's conference on local government at Warwick University on Saturday: ""Well, it's not helpful.""The referendum gave a result, gave a very clear decision on this, and we have to respect that decision, that's why we didn't block Article 50. ""But we are going to be part of all this campaigning, all these negotiations about the kind of relationship we have in Europe in the future.""  He added: ""The referendum happened, let's respect the result. Democracy happened, respect the result.""Mr Corbyn rejected Mr Blair's suggestion that the party was weak, pointing to its surge in membership to more than 500,000.""I don't quite know what Tony means there. Our party membership has more than doubled, we had a big campaign to remain and reform the European Union,"" he said.""We are now pursuing a policy which will try and protect jobs and conditions across this country but also maintain a good relationship with colleagues across Europe.""Mr Corbyn urged Mr Blair to get behind the party's vision of a future outside the European Union with high investment and reduced inequality, rather than a low-tax economy aligned with the US under President Donald Trump.He said: ""We are going to be outside the European Union. We are not leaving the continent of Europe, we are still going to work with them. ""I think it would be helpful if people put their energies in the direction of building those good relations and ensuring we have a viable economy, not some offshore tax haven bargain basement, doing deals with Trump's America.""My job is to take our party forward into an investment-led economy that reduces inequality in this country, that builds houses when people need them, that gets the good jobs people need in the hi-tech industries the National Investment Bank will fund.

PSA, which includes Peugeot, wants to buy General Motors' loss-making European arm, which includes Vauxhall plants at Luton and Ellesmere Port. There are fears that the deal could lead to job losses.Carlos Tavares, boss of PSA Group, is also set to hold talks with Unite union leader Len McCluskey.The company said it was engaged in a ""constructive dialogue"" with all parties.Vauxhall employs 4,500 workers at the two UK plants, with thousands more involved in its retail and components chain.A Downing Street spokesman said a request for a meeting with Mr Tavares had been received, adding: ""The meeting will take place, in principle, subject to diary availability."" Unite general secretary Mr McCluskey said he was pleased Mr Tavares had ""responded speedily and positively"" to his request for a meeting to discuss Peugeot's intentions.He said he would use the meeting to press the case for the UK's ""world class facilities and workforce"".Apart from meeting the prime minister, PSA will also see Germany's Angela Merkel. It could end up like a corporate beauty parade as Britain and Germany hope to persuade PSA not to shut factories in their respective countries.That's now a real possibility after General Motors said this week that it was in talks to sell its European brands of Opel and Vauxhall to PSA. European car manufacturers have far more production capacity than they need and PSA will probably want to consolidate its factories if it acquires GM Europe.Vauxhall's factories in Ellesmere Port and Luton are both very efficient, but they could face export tariffs when Britain leaves the single market, and probably the customs union, in two years - making those plants unviable.PSA said it was engaged in a ""constructive dialogue"" with all parties in the bid for GM's European division, which includes German-based Opel as well as Vauxhall.A spokesman said: ""Our intention is to establish the same maturity in our exchanges in France, Germany and the UK.""This is why Carlos Tavares has asked to meet Theresa May as it was done with German authorities.""David Bailey, professor of industrial strategy at Aston Business School in Birmingham, told the BBC that a deal would not be straightforward.""I think it's inevitable if this deal goes ahead that there will be plant closures. The plants in the UK look particularly vulnerable because of flexible labour markets and uncertainty over Brexit,"" he said.""So the government I think at some point will have to cut a deal with Peugeot, as it did with Nissan, over things like skills, innovation, rebuilding the supply chain.""And basically, what Nissan got, whatever it was, every other car producer in the UK will be looking for as well."""

2017-02-18,EU citizens 'denied residency documents',https://web.archive.org//web/20170219033155/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-39014191,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkEU citizens living in the UK say they are being denied a guarantee of permanent residency because they do not have health insurance.Under a little-known rule, EU citizens not in work or those looking for work must buy comprehensive insurance.One man told the Today programme his application had been  rejected, despite living in the UK since the age of 13.Peers are now trying to change the law. The Home Office said securing the status of EU migrants was a priority.Since the referendum in June, many EU citizens have applied for documents guaranteeing the right to live permanently in the UK.But the documents can only be obtained by migrants who have consistently either worked, sought work, or bought the insurance for five years.The Home Office does not remove people for failing to buy insurance, but will not issue them with the guarantee of permanent residence.As EU migrants can use the NHS, many did not realise they needed health insurance. Students and full-time parents are among those affected. They are worried they could be vulnerable after Britain leaves the EU. Tim Strahlendorf moved to the UK from Germany when he was 13. He said he had been refused a residency document because he had spent time studying in the UK without paying for health insurance.He said: ""It never would have occurred to me that anything like this could have happened.""Nina Hofmann, a married language tutor who moved from Germany to the UK in 2006, said her solicitor told her not to apply for residency because she would be refused.She took time out of work to care for her children - Benjamin, 6, and Sophia, 8 - and had not bought health insurance.She told Today: ""It is this fear I could be asked to leave in the end sooner or later. ""Maybe not with a knock on the door but with a letter because I've fallen through the cracks.""Migrants worriedAnother failed applicant for a permanent residence document was told by the Home Office she should make arrangements to leave.The government has since re-worded the letter, and failed applicants are not removed from the country, but many are worried they could be vulnerable after Britain leaves the EU.Liberal Democrat, Labour and crossbench peers want to amend the bill to include a fast track procedure to give EU migrants a reassurance they can live in the UK.The rule change would give people from the European Union, European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland the right to live permanently in the UK, without having to prove they bought insurance. The amendment has been tabled by Liberal Democrat Lord Oates, Labour's Lady Kennedy and crossbench peer Lord Cromwell.It is one of many amendments tabled, but its backers will hope for a concession from ministers as the Lords consider the Article 50 bill.A Home Office spokesman said EU citizens made a vital contribution and securing their status - and those of British nationals elsewhere in the EU - was a priority.He said: ""The rights of EU nationals living in the UK remain unchanged while we are a member of the European Union.""For self-sufficient people or students and their relevant family members, it's always been the case that exercising Treaty rights includes a requirement to have comprehensive sickness insurance and sufficient resources to not become a burden on the social assistance system of the United Kingdom.""According to the Migration Observatory at Oxford University, a quarter of applications for permanent residence documents were refused in 2015. Almost 15,000 EEA nationals received permanent residence documentation in the third quarter of 2016, after the referendum."

At the time, I didn't go to the police.But, last year, he was given full custody of my daughter so I went to the police because I was worried about her living with an abusive man.I spoke to them six times, but each time I was fobbed off.My ex-partner can be very charming and he's told lies about me to the social services and the police.Now the police won't take me seriously and investigate. I am currently planning to pay to have him privately prosecuted.I'm distraught. He has told lies about me and he has been believed. Nobody has gone after him. That's abuse in itself.As told to BBC News. *not her real nameVictims' commissioner Baroness Newlove, who also backed the plan, said she wanted to make sure  victims had confidence to come forward to report abuse.""I have met victims who have been dangled out their front window to scare them, who have been thrown into baths to be woken up from being beaten up - these are horrendous issues.""She said she knew of police interviews that had taken place in the home of the victim and perpetrator, meaning the victim was too scared to speak.1.8mPeople aged 16-59 who told Crime Survey for England and Wales they were a victim1.2m Female victims 651,000 Male victims 79%  Did not contact police 100,930 Cases resulted in prosecution During her six years as home secretary, Mrs May introduced domestic violence protection orders and a new offence against controlling and coercive behaviour.Domestic violence prosecutions and convictions have started to rise in recent years, and the prime minister said ""no stone will be left unturned in delivering a system that increases convictions, and works better for victims"".Anti-abuse charities including Women's Aid, the NSPCC and Refuge welcomed the news, with one saying the laws around domestic abuse needed to be clearer. Mark Brooks, chairman of the ManKind Initiative charity, called for a ""real step change"" in supporting and recognising male victims of domestic violence, saying they made up to a third of all victims.For Labour, shadow women and equalities secretary Sarah Champion said the consultation was ""much needed and long overdue"".She pointed out that the lack of central government funding for refuges for victims meant the quality and provision of support was inconsistent."
2017-02-18,Business rates revolt gathers pace,https://web.archive.org//web/20170219033155/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-39000471,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkSome of the UK's biggest employers' groups have united in condemning the government's ""outrageous"" changes to business rates in England.They are most vexed about a clause they say could prevent firms appealing against rate rises, even if firms can prove they are wrong.Thirteen of them, including the British Retail Consortium and CBI, have written a letter calling for it to be dropped.But a government spokesman said the ""claims are simply false"".And Treasury Minister, David Gauke, told the BBC three in four businesses would not see an increase in their bill.Other signatories to the letter include the Federation of Small Businesses, Revo, the Association of Convenience Stores, the British Chambers of Commerce and the British Property Federation.The next business rates revaluation comes into effect on 1 April - the first for seven years - but the lobby groups said that tens of thousands of firms still face uncertainty over bills.Earlier this week, pubs and restaurants called for Chancellor Philip Hammond to dilute the impact of the business rate rises in his March Budget.Business rates are in effect the commercial version of council tax, and are paid on the rental value of the space that businesses occupy. The amount depends of the size of the property and what it's used for.The last time properties were valued, in 2010, almost half of businesses appealed against how much they were due to pay. The government wants to cut down on the number of these appeals. The trade groups say the government wants the right to dismiss appeals against incorrect valuations that are deemed to be within the bounds of ""reasonable professional judgement"", or margin of error.This allowable margin of error has not been disclosed, but experts say it could be as much as 15%. Rates in Scotland are also being reassessed. The Scottish Assessors' Association, which sets the rateable value, has been carrying out a revaluation of properties, the first since 2010. It is supposed to do this every five years but the 2015 revaluation was delayed by the Scottish government.Wales is also reassessing rateable values for business. Both will come into effect on April 1. Reality Check: Are there more winners than losers on business rates?Neil Whitham runs a fish and chip shop in St Ives and will be paying about £4,000 more per year under the new system. He says:""We will be passing on some of the costs to our customers unfortunately. Life is never easy if you wish to be successful but I don't believe [the rates system] is fair. ""I believe the losers are supplementing the winners - those who have had rate reductions.""I would look to have a fairer system. Our rent has increased 25% over five years - we can stomach that - but in the same period rates up 62% just seems totally unfair...with other business taken out of the system altogether.""[If your property is worth] up to £12,000 in rateable value - you pay no rates. From £12,000 to £15,000 there's a taper system, and as soon as you hit £15,000 you're on a full 100% rates.""They're creating a tiered system on the High Street. ""You and a neighbour may have similar shops, with maybe 25% difference in square footage and one is paying full rates, £15,000 or more. so that equates to about £7,500 per year, the slightly smaller shop is paying nothing at all.""John Webber, head of ratings at property company Colliers International, said the problem was that the ""margin for error"" allowed by the government was simply too wide.He told the BBC: ""Every rateable value is an opinion, so there will be a boundary of judgement there. The problem you're going to have is if you have a property with a rateable value of £100,000 and you think it should be £90,000, then that 10% tolerance is arguably still within the bounds of reasonable professional judgement.""Therefore, the list will not be altered and as the rating list lasts for five years potentially you will be paying, over a five year period, at least 10% more than you should do,"" Mr Webber adds.Helen Dickinson, director-general of the British Retail Consortium, told the BBC that the tax was ""no longer fit for purpose in the 21st Century"".She says that although technically, under new government rules, business owners will be able to appeal against a higher valuation, a clause states that even if rates are found to be unfair they can still stand if they lie within the bounds of ""reasonable professional judgement"". This somewhat vague wording is, she says, ""what everyone is upset about"".Jerry Schurder, head of business rates at property consultancy Gerald Eve and a supporter of the protest, said: ""The government's outrageous proposals... would force hard-pressed businesses to cough up an extra £1.9bn to pay for the Valuation Office Agency's (VOA) mistakes.""The way that trade bodies from a wide spectrum of industries have been motivated to unite against this clause shows the strength of feeling against what is a punitive and deeply unfair proposal,"" Mr Schurder said.But the government issued a strong rejection of the claims. A spokesman said: ""These claims are simply false. We are not preventing anyone from appealing their bills, or setting any margin of error for appeals being heard. ""We're reforming the appeals process to make it easier for businesses to check, challenge and appeal their bills, while at the same time generous business rate reliefs mean thousands more businesses are seeing a reduction.""He added that, once the changes come in to effect, 600,000 businesses will pay not rates at all."
2017-02-18,UK troops given Estonian strip club guide,https://web.archive.org//web/20170219033155/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38972213,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe Ministry of Defence (MoD) provided British soldiers with a guide to strip clubs in the Estonian capital, a freedom of information request to the department has revealed.The advice featured in a booklet titled ""Tallinn guide for friendly forces"", given to troops taking part in a Nato Steadfast Javelin training operation.The operation took place in May 2015. The MoD would not comment on the guide but said advice on ""staying safe"" was routinely given to troops while abroad.The BBC requested copies of various documents concerning the operation, also known as Exercise Hedgehog. In its response, the department provided the guide, which includes a section detailing three strip clubs in Tallinn. Lasso Baar was said to be a ""big strip bar with one of the prettiest dancers"" and Soho was identified as the ""biggest strip club in Estonia"". X Club was billed as ""the most professional strip club with various elements"".The guide also gave British troops further advice on what to expect at Estonian strip clubs.Troops were informed that ""all strip clubs offer private rooms for individual dances"", and that ""the average level of rolling tips to girls is 5 to 20 euros"". They were also advised ""to use cash in such places"".Asked if it was appropriate for the government to provide such material, a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Defence said: ""As you would expect, we routinely provide guidance to our people about staying safe while on deployment.""The department would not comment on who had produced the guide, how it had been distributed to troops, or whether it would be issued to troops serving in Estonia in future.The guide included other nightlife tips, such as pubs Mad Murphy's and Hell Hunt, or visiting the city's historic Old Town for a dash of Baltic culture.It also offered a warning on public drinking, saying that to avoid a police fine, ""when you want to drink spirits in the street it is wise to cover the bottles"".And it includes gift ideas for British troops. It suggests a visit to a shop called Bonbon Lingerie as a good place to pick up something special for wives and girlfriends. In terms of a bottle of something to bring home, it suggests Vana Tallinn or Old Tallinn liquor, of which the guide says, ""Finns just love it and some of them use it as a sleeping pill."" A spokesperson for the Estonian embassy in London said the Estonian government had not produced the guide.""According to the information received from the Estonian Defence Forces this is not an official document produced by or for the Government of Estonia."" Operation Steadfast Javelin was a major Nato training exercise, in which 13,000 troops and reserves defended positions against a simulated attack by land and air. "

2017-02-18,Aslef members reject Southern deal,https://web.archive.org//web/20170219033155/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-38994965,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkAslef members have rejected a deal with Southern rail that would have ended a long-running industrial dispute.It had been arguing with parent firm, Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR), over driver-only operated (DOO) trains.Members of the drivers' union rejected the deal by 54.1% to 45.9%. The turnout was 72.7%.Under the proposed agreement, Southern would have been able to run trains without a guard or onboard supervisor under certain circumstances.Mick Whelan, general secretary of Aslef, said: ""We understand and support the decision arrived at democratically by our members and will now work to deliver a resolution in line with their expectations.""David Sidebottom, of independent watchdog Transport Focus, said: ""The hope that services would improve on Southern has now been dashed for their passengers.""They have had enough of the on-going industrial action. They have faced months of lost time, lost money and deep frustration at not being able to rely on the trains.""It is vital that all parties in this dispute get back around the table to bring the services back to normal as soon as possible.""Nick Brown, GTR's chief operating officer, said: ""Naturally we're saddened and hugely disappointed, as will be our passengers, with today's decision by drivers, particularly as the agreement carried the full support and recommendation of the Aslef leadership. ""We now need to understand the issues which led to this outcome and we'll be seeking to meet with the union as soon as possible to see how we can agree a way forward.""The dispute centres on Southern's decision to turn guards into on-board supervisors. In this role they would no longer be responsible for opening and closing carriage doors - this duty would become the responsibility of the driver.The dispute began in April when conductors - who are members of the RMT union - first took industrial action.Aslef members first walked out over the plans in December, leading to the cancellation of all Southern services.Aslef leaders announced they had reached a deal with GTR on 2 February following 11 days of talks.The RMT said at the time it was ""a shocking betrayal"", and it has now been rejected by Aslef members.A DfT spokesman said: ""It is disappointing that Aslef members have rejected the offer negotiated by their leaders at the TUC.""The union leadership must now return to talks and work with their members on a deal they can back.""  RMT leader Mick Cash said his union remained ""focused"" on the campaign to ""protect the safety of the travelling public and put access and safe operation before profits"".He added: ""[We] will now look to take that campaign into its next phase [by] working with our sister rail unions, the wider trade union movement and the passengers who use the railway.""RMT repeats the call to Southern to give the guarantee of a second, safety critical member of staff on their trains and to sit down with the unions in new talks around the issue of safe train despatch.""The RMT held separate talks with Southern managers earlier this week, which broke down without an agreement after three hours.On Wednesday, it announced further industrial action, saying conductors would walk out for 24 hours on 22 February. There we have it. Aslef drivers voted by a small majority to reject the deal their leaders had struck with Southern. That's not entirely surprising. Many saw the announcement of the deal as the end of the dispute, but that was wishful thinking. Once we saw the details it was clear some drivers wouldn't be happy. That deal gave a list of ""exceptional circumstances"" under which a train might run without its scheduled Onboard Supervisor, or OBS. Even assurances that those 'exceptional circumstances' didn't include RMT strike action proved insufficient. This wasn't just about solidarity with striking guards. Many drivers remain unconvinced that trains can be run safely without an OBS on board. What happens next depends on the reaction of key players. Southern moved quickly to offer fresh talks, and Aslef's Mick Whelan promised to ""work to deliver a resolution"" - with a relatively small 54.1% majority of drivers rejecting the deal, they'll hope it won't take too many tweaks to produce an acceptable deal. But commuters will be painfully aware of the disruption further strikes would cause. This dispute has run for months and there's no longer much cause to feel like it's coming to an end. "

The worst offenders include the US, Japan, Nigeria and Russia.The Foreign Office insists diplomats are not exempt from paying the charge.According to Transport for London (TfL), around three quarters of embassies in London do pay the charge, ""but there remains a stubborn minority who refuse to do so, despite our representations through diplomatic channels"".The US Embassy, which argues it is a tax and so covered by diplomatic immunity, owes the most, at more than £11.5m, while the Australian High Commission is among nations that owe the least, at £120.Top 10 congestion charge embassy debtors:Following legal advice, TfL's view is that the matter should be taken to the International Court of Justice in The Hague, but this needs government support, which is why it has been raised with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.Paul Cowperthwaite, TfL's general manager for congestion charging, said: ""We are clear that the congestion charge is a charge for a service and not a tax. This means that foreign diplomats are not exempt from paying it.""We continue to pursue all unpaid congestion charge fees and related penalty charge notices.""In October we wrote to the foreign secretary to ask him to take up the matter with the relevant embassies and the International Court of Justice.""Solution soughtTfL figures suggest that London-based embassies owe £105,258,715 for the period since the congestion charge was launched in 2003 and 31 December 2016 - up from £58m in 2012.A Foreign Office spokesman said: ""Our position is clear: there are no legal grounds to exempt diplomats from paying the London congestion charge. This is not a tax, and the majority of diplomatic missions in London recognise this and pay.""We are committed to working with TfL to find a solution to the problem of non-payment by some missions."" The congestion charge was introduced by former London mayor Ken Livingstone in February 2003, with the aim of reducing traffic congestion in and around the city centre between 07:00 and 18:00 Mondays to Fridays. The current charge is £11.50 per day."

2017-02-18,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20170219033155/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThis article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide to the UK's vote to leave the European Union. It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 52% to 48%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who resigned on the day after losing the referendum. Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she says she will respect the will of the people. She has said ""Brexit means Brexit"" but there is still a lot of debate about what that will mean in practice especially on the two key issues of how British firms do business in the European Union and what curbs are brought in on the rights of European Union nationals to live and work in the UK. She set out more details of her negotiating hopes in her key speech on Brexit.The UK economy appears to have weathered the initial shock of the Brexit vote, although the value of the pound remains near a 30-year low, but opinion is sharply divided over the long-term effects of leaving the EU. Some major firms such as Easyjet and John Lewis have pointed out that the slump in sterling has increased their costs. Britain also lost its top AAA credit rating, meaning the cost of government borrowing will be higher. But share prices have recovered from a dramatic slump in value, with both the FTSE 100 and the broader FTSE 250 index, which includes more British-based businesses, trading higher than before the referendum. The Bank of England cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - a record low and the first cut since 2009 - after the vote and there has not been the economic slump or recession that some had predicted. The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it has to invoke an agreement called Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May has said she intends to trigger this process by the end of March 2017, meaning the UK will be expected to have left by the summer of 2019, depending on the precise timetable agreed during the negotiations. The government will also enact a Great Repeal Bill which will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. It is expected to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove.After a court battle, the UK's Supreme Court ruled in January that Parliament must be consulted before Article 50 is invoked. This is why a two line Brexit bill is currently making its way through Parliament. MPs have approved it after Labour MPs were told to support it. It is now heading to the House of Lords to be debated and voted on.Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These men - dubbed the Three Brexiteers - will play a central role in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although it will be Mrs May, as prime minister, who will have the final say. David Cameron's government did not do any emergency planning for Brexit ahead of the referendum and Mrs May has rejected calls to say what her negotiating goals are.Once Article 50 has been triggered, the UK will have two years to negotiate its withdrawal. But no one really knows how the Brexit process will work - Article 50 was only created in late 2009 and it has never been used. Former Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, now Chancellor, wanted Britain to remain in the EU, and he has suggested it could take up to six years for the UK to complete exit negotiations. The terms of Britain's exit will have to be agreed by 27 national parliaments, a process which could take some years, he has argued. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. The UK will continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making.Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Following Theresa May's Brexit recent speech we now know that the UK is not intending to stay in the EU's single market. Although there has been speculation for months about the issue, it would have meant the UK staying under the auspices of the European Court of Justice and having to allow unlimited EU immigration, under freedom of movement rules.Both sides want trade to continue after Brexit with the UK seeking a positive outcome for those who wish to trade goods and services"" - such as those in the City of London and wanting a ""comprehensive free trade deal"" giving the UK ""the greatest possible access"" to the single market. Mrs May says she wants the UK to reach a new customs union deal with the EU. A customs union is where countries agree not to impose tariffs on each others' goods and have a common tariff on goods coming in from elsewhere. The UK is currently part of the EU customs union but that stops the UK being able to do its own trade deals with other countries. Reality Check: How could customs union work?These terms have increasingly been used as debate focused on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people in order to maintain access to the EU single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result.The government has declined to give a firm guarantee about the status of EU nationals currently living in the UK, saying this is not possible without a reciprocal pledge from other EU members about the millions of British nationals living on the continent. EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, will be be able to stay, the chief civil servant at the Home Office has said. The rights of other EU nationals would be subject to negotiations on Brexit and the ""will of Parliament"", he added.A lot depends on the kind of deal the UK agrees with the EU. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions on EU nationals, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.Again, it depends on whether the UK government decides to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages. Citizens' Advice has reminded people their rights have not changed yet and asked anyone to contact them if they think they have been discriminated against following the Leave vote.Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested EU migrants who come to the UK as Brexit nears may not be given the right to stay. He has said there might have to be a cut-off point if there was a ""surge"" in new arrivals.People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote. The day-to-day spending impact is likely to be more significant. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it to remain at least 10% below where it was on 23 June, in the long term. This means imported goods will consequently get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have already been seen and the issue was most notably illustrated by the dispute between Tesco and Marmite's makers about whether prices would be put up or not in the stores.The latest UK inflation figures, for January, showed the CPI inflation rate rising to 1.8%, its highest level for two and a half years, with signs of more cost pressures set to feed through in the months to come.Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration.She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations. As mentioned above, the key issue is whether other EU nations will grant the UK access to the single market, if that is what it wants, while at the same time being allowed to restrict the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK.Mrs May has said she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. It is currently running at 330,000 a year, of which 184,000 are EU citizens, and 188,000 are from outside the EU - the figures include a 39,000 outflow of UK citizens.It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Liberal Democrats - who have just a handful of MPs - have vowed to halt Brexit and keep Britain in the EU if they were to win the next general election.Some commentators, including former House of Commons clerk Lord Lisvane, have argued that a further referendum would be needed to ratify whatever deal the UK hammers out with the EU, but there are few signs political leaders view this as a viable option.Yes. Theresa May has appeared keen to avoid a vote on her negotiating stance, to avoid having to give away her priorities, but Theresa May has said there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. It is worth mentioning that any deal also has to be agreed by the European Parliament - with British MEPs getting a chance to vote on it there.  While there could be limitations on British nationals' ability to live and work in EU countries, it seems unlikely they would want to deter tourists. There are many countries outside the European Economic Area, which includes the 28 EU nations plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway, that British citizens can visit for up to 90 days without needing a visa and it is possible that such arrangements could be negotiated with European countries.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. In theory, the government could, if it wanted, decide to change the colour, which is currently standardised for EU countries, says the BBC's Europe correspondent, Chris Morris.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketNo nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it is ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faces being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. A second independence referendum for the country is now ""highly likely"", she has said, although not in 2017. She has said she wants Scotland to stay in the single market and said Mrs May's decision to rule out the UK staying in the single market ""undoubtedly"" brings the referendum closer.Before his resignation Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said the impact in Northern Ireland would be ""very profound"" and that the whole island of Ireland should now be able to vote on reunification. But, speaking while she was still Northern Ireland Secretary, Theresa Villiers ruled out the call from Sinn Féin for a border poll, saying the circumstances in which one would be called did not exist. The land border is likely to be a key part of the Brexit talks. Theresa May said a priority for her would be negotiating a deal with the EU which allowed a common travel area between the UK and the Republic of Ireland.During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest. But his successor Theresa May has said she will keep it in place, at least for the current Parliament, which is due to last until 2020.So far there has been a cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. There are yet to be signs that rising inflation have worried the Bank of England  enough to consider raising interest rates.  But if that happened it would make mortgages and loans more expensive to repay - but would be good news for savers.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.Eurotunnel boss Jacques Gounon said last November the reintroduction of duty-free would be ""an incredible boost for my business"" but he later said  that remark had been ""light-hearted"". Erik Juul-Mortensen, president of the Tax Free World Association (TFWA) said after the referendum vote ""it is not possible to predict how Brexit will affect the duty free and travel retail industry, and it is wiser not to make assumptions about exactly what the impact will be.""  They are at the moment but no-one knows the longer term prospects for definite. The EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - is not an EU initiative. It was negotiated between countries within a group known as the European Economic Area, often simply referred to as the single market (plus Switzerland, which confusingly is not a member of the EEA, but has agreed access to the single market). Therefore, the future of Britons' EHIC cover could depend on whether the UK decided to sever ties with the EEA.Probably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report. In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two-thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.However, the UK government is committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, the UK government is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR. However, the EU has its own European Court of Justice, whose decisions are binding on EU institutions and member states.Its rulings have sometimes caused controversy in Britain and supporters of a Brexit have called for immediate legislation to curb its powers. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also cited sovereignty and democracy, and they wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Four of the biggest US banks have committed to helping maintain the City's position. But HSBC will move up to 1,000 jobs to Paris, the BBC understands. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Pest control firm Rentokil Initial says it could make £15m extra this year thanks to a weaker currency.Others are less optimistic. Hilary Jones, a director at UK cosmetics firm Lush said the company was ""terrified"" about the economic impact. She added that while the firm's Dorset factory would continue to produce goods for the UK market, products for the European market may be made at its new plant in Germany.Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After the Leave vote, the government will probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""As with most elements of the UK economy, not enough solid data has been published yet to accurately conclude the Brexit effect on house prices. Industry figures have pointed to ""uncertainty"" among buyers and sellers that could potentially change the housing market.So far, the most significant research has come from the respected Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which has published the conclusions of a survey of its members. This primarily records sentiment among surveyors.It found that house prices are expected to fall across the UK in the three months after the referendum vote. However, the dip in prices is only expected to persist over the 12 months from June in London and East Anglia, surveyors predict.House prices were already slowing in central London, owing to the fall-out from changes to stamp duty rules in April.Separate figures from property portal Rightmove suggested the average asking price of houses coming on to the market in England and Wales fell by 0.9%, or £2,647, in July compared with June. It said that agents had reported very few sales had fallen through as a result of the vote.Many potential first-time buyers would welcome a fall in house prices, with ownership among the young falling owing to affordability concerns. Investors in property, or those who have paid off a mortgage and hope to leave homes as inheritance would be unhappy with a long-term reduction in value.  Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law following the decision to leave the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" will not necessarily disappear overnight - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU means the UK will not be part of TTIP. It will have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Former Labour health secretary Lord Owen has said that because of TTIP (see answer above) the only way to protect the NHS from further privatisation was to get out of the EU."

Mr Snell is a member and former leader of Newcastle-under-Lyme Council, who campaigned for a Remain vote in the EU referendum.UKIP, which narrowly beat the Conservatives into second place in the 2015 general election, is fielding its leader, Paul Nuttall, as its candidate. The MEP was born in Bootle, where he has stood in the last three general elections.The Tories have chosen 25-year-old city councillor Jack Brereton. He is the deputy leader of the Conservative Group in the council's ruling coalition, where he is also the Cabinet member for Regeneration, Transport and Heritage. The Green Party has picked Adam Colclough as their candidate, with Zulfiqar Ali standing for the Liberal Democrats.See below for a full list of candidates.The successful Liberal Democrat by-election campaign in Richmond Park in December was seen as a result of the party making Brexit a key issue in what was a very Remain constituency.The wider Stoke area (which includes Stoke Central) voted strongly to Leave in June's referendum so the question is how much of an impact Brexit is likely to have. Since being created for the 1950 general election, Stoke Central has always returned Labour MPs.It has traditionally been seen as rock solid Labour territory and Mr Hunt won in 2015 by a 5,179 margin.Labour's majority has been decreasing sharply in recent years, from 49.5% in 1997 to 16.7% in 2015.Stoke-on-Trent Central covers the administrative centre of the six Potteries towns: Burslem, Fenton, Hanley, Longton, Stoke-upon-Trent and Tunstall.As BBC Midlands political editor Patrick Burns notes, this may be the last time the seat is contested.""For all its rich history and industrial heritage, it's set to be scrapped under proposed Parliamentary boundary changes which would reduce Stoke's present three seats to two,"" he says.""And with (Labour MPs) Ruth Smeeth and Rob Flello apparently in no mood to relinquish their neighbouring seats, it's no wonder that this is being unofficially dubbed as a job for three years.""Mr Nuttall has admitted a previous claim that he lost ""close personal friends"" in the Hillsborough disaster was wrong.The UKIP candidate apologised and said the quotes on his website from 2011 were ""wrong"" and had been taken down.There was also a clash with Labour over whether Mr Nuttall was actually living in the Stoke house registered as his address on nomination papers. UKIP later said he had to leave the house for safety reasons after the address was circulated on social media.Mr Snell, meanwhile, has apologised after some of his old tweets about people appearing on TV shows have re-emerged, including a description of panellists on ITV's Loose Women as ""squabbling sour-faced ladies"" and remarks about Janet Street-Porter and a woman on the BBC's The Apprentice.The Labour candidate also previously posted disparaging remarks about his party's current leader Jeremy Corbyn and Brexit.Here is a list of the candidates, in alphabetical order by surname:Polls open at 07:00 GMT on 23 February and close at 22:00 GMT."
2017-02-18,Copeland by-election guide,https://web.archive.org//web/20170219033155/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38967082,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkSeveral party leaders have made the long trip from Westminster to the west Cumbrian constituency of Copeland in recent weeks.It's home to some stunning Lake District scenery - but their visits have been with an eagerly-anticipated by-election in mind.Voters go the polls on 23 February to elect a replacement for Labour MP Jamie Reed, who quit Parliament to work in the nuclear industry.It's one of two by-elections taking place that day, with Labour also defending the seat of Stoke-on-Trent Central.The remote coastal seat is mainly rural, hill-farming country and includes Scafell Pike, England's tallest mountain, and Wastwater, its deepest lake, which was named Britain's favourite view in 2007.It is also home to the fishing port of Whitehaven and the Sellafield nuclear processing site, which directly employs over 10,000 people.Labour has chosen Gill Troughton as its candidate. The councillor and former doctor and ambulance driver was chosen from an all-woman shortlist.Up against her for the Conservatives is Trudy Harrison, who lives in the village of Bootle and was a parish councillor for a number of years.UKIP has chosen its 2015 general election candidate, Fiona Mills.The Liberal Democrats have chosen Rebecca Hanson and the Green Party Jack Lenox as their candidates. There are also two independent candidates - Michael Guest and Roy Ivinson.Copeland and its predecessor Whitehaven have been Labour since 1935, but the seat has become more marginal in recent years.Mr Reed, who had been an MP since 2005, held the seat by 2,564 votes from the Conservatives in 2015, with UKIP another 8,038 votes behind in third.The Tories are bidding to become the first governing party to make a by-election gain - not including a 1982 poll triggered by a defecting Labour MP - since 1960.With nearly 11,000 people employed at Sellafield, thousands more in the supply chain and a new power plant proposed in the constituency, the nuclear industry has been a key issue.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's previous opposition to new nuclear power stations has been highlighted by his opponents, although the Labour leader has since given his backing for the £10bn Moorside plant, due to open in 2024.Doubts were raised over the project after Toshiba, which has a 60% share in NuGen, the firm behind the scheme, sustained heavy losses.During a visit to the constituency, Prime Minister Theresa May was asked about union calls for the government to guarantee the investment to ensure the project goes ahead, saying her party ""recognises the importance"" of the nuclear industry.The prime minister also faced questions about the future of Whitehaven's West Cumberland Hospital, with Labour campaigning hard on the future of the maternity unit amid concerns consultant-led services could be moved elsewhere.A key link road, the A595, has also been inspected by both Transport Secretary, Chris Grayling and his Labour counterpart, Andy McDonald, with campaigners calling for urgent improvements to be made.Polls will be open from 07:00 GMT on 23 February until 22:00 BST, with the result expected overnight."
2017-02-18,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20170219033155/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-39007019,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkFormer Prime Minister Tony Blair has launched a campaign to try to persuade the British people to change their minds about leaving the European Union. It comes just weeks before the government intends to trigger the departure mechanism. In a speech in London, he said that he respected the will of the people, but voters hadn't been given details about the terms on which Britain would exit the EU. Mr Blair argued that what he called the ""cost"" of Brexit was only now becoming clear. The referendum vote, he said, was based on ""imperfect knowledge"" which would now become ""informed knowledge"".It's true that we don't yet know the details of the UK's future relationship with the rest of the EU - that will depend on the deal that is negotiated - but lots was said during the referendum campaign about what Brexit would mean in more general terms. In particular, campaigners from both sides said leaving the EU would entail leaving the single market.Mr Blair suggested that immigration was the main issue that propelled Leave to victory in the referendum campaign. But, he argued, the effect of quitting would probably have only a modest impact on overall immigration levels.He pointed out that just over half of migration into the UK comes from outside the EU. That's confirmed by official statistics from the ONS. In the year to June 2016 net migration - the difference between the number of people who arrived and the number of people who left - was 196,000 from outside the EU, compared with 189,000 from inside the EU.The same is true for the gross migration statistics - ie just looking at how many citizens from different parts of the world arrived in the UK.Again, there were slightly more from outside the EU (289,000) than from inside (284,000) along with a smaller number of British citizens returning to live in the UK (77,000). And only an estimated 82,000 or 12.6% of the 650,000 total were EU citizens who arrived looking for work.Theresa May has ruled out introducing a points-based migration system but the government hasn't published details of what it does want to implement. If the new system continues to allow in EU migrants with job offers, as well as students and people coming to join spouses, then Mr Blair's 12% would be, broadly speaking, correct. There could be a bigger impact if the government opts for a capped number of work permits. But about half of total migration will be unaffected no matter what arrangements are made with the EU.This isn't really a fair quotation. It's a reference to an interview given by Philip Hammond on ITV's Peston on Sunday on 26 June.Mr Hammond said: ""I believe it's essential that we protect our access to the single European market. Whether we like it or not, our economy, over 40 years, has become shaped by that access, and to lose that access now would be catastrophic.""But note that he was talking about access to the single market. That's not the same as membership. You don't have to be a member of the single market to have access to it, although the level of access that Britain would have after leaving the single market would depend on what trade relationship was negotiated.It's true that the pound has fallen against the dollar and the euro since the referendum, although not by quite as much as Mr Blair said. It has recovered from its lowest point. Against the dollar, the pound is currently down about 16% compared with its pre-referendum level. Against the euro, it's about 10.5% down.It's also worth noting that the pound/euro exchange rate was at a similar level to now between 2009 and the middle of 2011, so it's hardly unprecedented. Against the dollar, though, the pound has hit multi-decade lows in recent months."
2017-02-18,'Block him out',https://web.archive.org//web/20170219033155/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38096514,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkIf Jenny ever gets married, there will be no dad walking her down the aisle and, if she gets her way, no mention of him on her marriage certificate either.This is because, according to the twenty-something professional, the man who sexually abused her for 18 months from the age of seven ""lost any right to be called my father"".Despite his horrific betrayal of the relationship between father and daughter, the current law gives the option for only his name and occupation to be recorded on her future marriage certificate - but not that of her mother ""who has been mum and dad all wrapped up in one"".This system, of recording only the names of the father of the bride and groom on the certificate, dates back to the early years of Queen Victoria's reign. While either party can ask for a line to be put through that box if they have never known their father or been brought up by a step-father, it's an inequality many people like Jenny feel should be addressed.It is also an issue that has provoked anger among MPs from all parties, who have spent several years attempting to bring about a change in the law to allow both parents to have their names and occupations recorded.Their campaign was given a boost when a petition on Change.org, calling for mothers' names to be added to marriage certificates, collected 70,600 signatures in January 2014. The petition said ""marriage should not be seen as a business transaction between the father of the bride and the father of the groom"".Former Prime Minister David Cameron said later that year that he would address this ""inequality in marriage"", adding that the exclusion of mothers' names from marriage registers in England and Wales did ""not reflect modern Britain"".Mr Cameron was gone from Downing Street before any action was taken and it now seems that Conservative MP Edward Argar's Registration of Marriage Bill is the most likely vehicle to overturn the law.A brief history of marriage:His bill, which would update the Marriage Act of 1949, would move the solely paper-based system to a central electronic register online, which would allow the mother's name to be included.It would also bring England and Wales into line with the rest of the UK. In Scotland and Northern Ireland, couples are asked to give the names of both parents on marriage documentation. The same applies for those entering a civil partnership.Similar attempts by Labour and Conservative MPs to change the law fell in 2015 after failing to get ministers' support. Labour frontbencher Christina Rees' private member's bill focused on the narrow point about putting the mother on the certificate. Former Conservative cabinet minister Dame Caroline Spelman's bill wanted marriages listed in a single electronic register instead of in marriage register books.Former home office minister Richard Harrington said at the time ""a combination"" of the two bills ""could deal with things quickly"".Unlike his predecessors', Mr Argar's bill - which is more like Dame Caroline's attempt - has succeeded in getting government backing because it will create a more secure system for keeping marriage records.""The whole point of this bill is the mothers and fathers of the bride and groom will be registered,"" said the Charnwood MP. ""In the great scheme of things it's a minor change, but it's symbolically very important for a large number of people who want a recognition of the role their mother played in their upbringing.""He added: ""It will also give victims of abuse, children of single mothers or errant fathers, the choice over whether to include their mother's names and not their father's.""You will see virtually no outward change in the form of the marriage ceremony, just in the manner that things are recorded. By moving to an online schedule system, we can easily amend the paper documentation - and it's more secure because it doesn't rely on the old parish register that is at risk of theft from the village church.""The church is supportive of the move, and over time it will save the taxpayer millions of pounds in administrative costs.""The bill is set to return to the Commons for its detailed committee stage after the half-term recess, and Mr Argar is hopeful it will receive Royal Assent - and so become law - by the summer.A spokesman for the Home Office said it wanted to see mothers' names recorded on marriage certificates ""as soon as possible"".Mum's done everythingFor Jenny, whose name has been changed to protect her identity, the law change cannot come soon enough. ""My dad's a rapist and he abused me and my sisters, so I never want any reference to him appearing on anything about my future,"" she said. ""He has no right to that - he lost that right many years ago.""I was only seven when the attacks started, and my siblings were much younger. It ended after I told my mother when I was eight and a half.""I've tried to block out what he did to me. ""I have a partner and I'm sure we will get married eventually, but I don't want my father involved in any way.  I'd only want my mum's name on the marriage certificate because as far as I'm concerned she's done everything for us."""

2017-02-18,Keeping order,https://web.archive.org//web/20170219033155/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38983950,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe Commons Speaker, John Bercow, is not afraid to stick his neck out - but at least he won't get his head cut off, unlike a few of his predecessors....It has always been a role with the potential for controversy.   Sir Peter de la Mare, the Speaker or ""Prolocutor"" of the Good Parliament in April 1376 opened the first day with a long address on the shortcomings of the Crown - military failures, financial and moral corruption. Royal favourites were imprisoned. King Edward III's mistress, Alice Perrers, was condemned to ""seclusion"".  But by the autumn, royalty had fought back. The Parliament was dissolved and most of its work was undone. The King's mistress was back at Court.  The King's son, John of Gaunt, had Sir Peter de la Mare thrown in jail. And the new Speaker was John of Gaunt's own steward, the far more biddable Sir Thomas Huntingford.Until the 17th Century, the Speaker's loyalty was to the Crown rather than to MPs.  But they were often blamed if they delivered news the monarch didn't like.  It could be a dangerous job: seven Speakers were beheaded between 1394 and 1535.  That's why even today a new Speaker traditionally makes a show of being dragged reluctantly to the Chair.Staying on the right side of the Crown was especially tricky during the turmoil of the Wars of the Roses, when it was hard to be sure who would end up being the King.  One Speaker, John Wenlock, tried to hedge his bets by fighting on the side of both the Yorkists and the Lancastrians.   It didn't work out well. He was killed at the Battle of Tewkesbury, allegedly by his own commander who blamed Wenlock's general indecisiveness for the defeat. Gradually, the Speaker's role became one of representing Parliament, rather than the monarch. When Charles I came in person to the Commons on 4 January 1642 to arrest five MPs for treason, Speaker William Lenthall refused to reveal where they were. Hitherto seen as a rather timorous chap, this was his moment. He fell to his knees, but told the King: ""May it please your Majesty, I have neither eyes to see nor tongue to speak in this place but as the House is pleased to direct me, whose servant I am here.""  The King was humiliated and left without the men he'd come for.John Bercow is being criticised by some MPs today for - in their view - failing to be impartial on political issues. But the Speaker's impartiality is a relatively modern notion. In fact, some Speakers held other government offices at the same time.  They could take part in some debates and vote, when they weren't actually presiding over business. Arthur Onslow, who had the job for more than 30 years, began to change that. In fact, he used to boast of his impartiality - to the great irritation and disappointment of the Prime Minister, Sir Robert Walpole, who'd helped him to the job.It wasn't until the Victorian era that our current ideas of impartiality became the norm - though Irish Nationalists in the 1880s felt that Speaker Henry Brand stepped over the line in helping to put down their disruption in the Commons over Irish Home rule. In January 1881, they prolonged debate for 41 hours.  There were disorderly scenes. Irish MPs defied the Chair. And so, Speaker Brand helped the government to invent new procedures, still in use today, to cut the debate short on the Coercion Bill for Ireland.In spite of the controversies, it's almost unprecedented to sack a Speaker. Although in recent times, Michael Martin, was pressured into resigning, the only other one to be ousted forcibly was Sir John Trevor in 1695, who'd been found guilty of accepting a £1,000 bribe.  He also had the disadvantage of being so cross-eyed that MPs couldn't tell if he was giving them the nod to speak, or looking at someone else.And of course, for any MP who tries to oust a Speaker but fails, there's a big risk that in future debates, the Speaker seems strangely unable to see them at all, when they're hoping to be called."
2017-02-18,They said what?,https://web.archive.org//web/20170219033155/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38980742,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkIt was Abraham Lincoln's 208th birthday last weekend. The US Republican Party's social media feeds honoured the 16th president by sharing a picture of his iconic memorial in Washington DC, with an inspiring quote laid over the top. ""In the end, it's not the years in your life that counts, it's the life in your years,"" was the message on Twitter and Instagram, also shared by President Trump.There was just one problem: the words have been attributed to Lincoln many times over the years, but there is no evidence he ever said them. The post has since been deleted.It was the latest example of a growing modern phenomenon, the fake political quote.Some have said ""fake news"" could have swung the outcome of November's US presidential election. Bogus stories like ""Pope Francis Shocks World, Endorses Donald Trump for President"" were extensively shared online.Made up quotes are perhaps more benign than fictitious news stories with a clear political agenda. But they still raise concerns, says James Ball of Buzzfeed News, who is writing a book about ""post-truth"" politics.""If enough people share and believe these fake quotes, then they can contribute to the polarisation of politics, making each side think less of the other, especially as many partisans think fake news is a problem which affects primarily (or only) their opponents.""These fake quotes don't just come from right-wing politicians and activists. In the days after the US election, a quote supposedly taken from a 1998 Donald Trump interview went viral online. ""If I were to run, I'd run as a Republican. They're the dumbest group of voters in the country. They believe anything on Fox News. I could lie and they'd still eat it up,"" the quote said.It seemed too obnoxious to be true - and it was.Fake George Orwell quotes are a specialty in left-wing social media circles. One example is ""during times of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act."" There is no evidence the 1984 author ever said these words, but social media is awash with shareable pictures of them alongside Orwell's monochrome face.So how do bogus quotes like this get into circulation?""Sometimes people just want new followers or shares on social media, and either invent a quote or (naively or otherwise) lift a questionable one,"" says James Ball. ""Others invent quotes as a hoax or parody to show up people they disagree with, or to fire up their own side - or simply to make money from adverts on fake news sites.""The internet means fake quotes can spread very quickly. ""It's easier to fabricate things than it is to debunk them,"" says Rasmus Nielsen, director of research at the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at the University of Oxford. ""As communication gets easier, there is going to be more and more of this stuff floating about online.""Jenni Sargent runs First Draft News, which is working with social media companies and news organisations to look at innovative solutions to the problem.""People are experimenting with the most engaging way to spread false information,"" she says. She wants news websites to come up with entertaining ways of debunking fake facts and quotes.A blue tick next to a name on Twitter tells you the account has been verified as ""authentic"". Sargent wants to come up with ways to highlight unreliable sources, ""like the opposite of a blue tick"".Facebook is introducing tools for German users to flag false stories ahead of that country's parliamentary elections in the autumn. Third-party fact checkers would mark unreliable stories as ""disputed"".The BBC has also said it will fact check deliberately misleading stories ""masquerading as news"".   British MP Damian Collins is chairing a parliamentary inquiry into these issues, which will look at the possibility of news websites having ""verified"" markers. Collins thinks fake quotes attributed to electoral candidates could end up ""distorting the democratic process"".Often verifying quotes is simply a case of rigorously searching through publicly available information, says Kim LaCapria, who works for rumour-busting website Snopes. The volume of dubious content online is greater than ever before, but verification can be easier because far more information is digitised, she says. ""It's actually pretty easy for average social media users to fact check online.""Her job involves looking at outright fake quotes, but also real quotes presented in a misleading way. For example, Al Gore has been ridiculed for claiming he ""invented the internet"". The former vice president did once say ""I took the initiative in creating the Internet,"" but taken in full context, that line seems rather more modest.We are less likely to expend energy verifying a quote which confirms our political beliefs, says LaCapria, an effect which psychologists call confirmation bias.Whether a fake quote comes from the left or the right, it tends to have one common feature, she says. ""It validates our preconceived beliefs or feelings, and that's often proffered as a valid reason to spread it."""
2017-02-18,Race to reform,https://web.archive.org//web/20170219033155/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-38970265,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThere is a theory in politics that times of upheaval and uncertainty present opportunities as well as problems.It's best summed up in the saying that you should never let a good crisis go to waste - an aphorism so seductive that it has been attributed to all the usual historical suspects, from Machiavelli to Winston Churchill.It is perhaps in this spirit that the European Parliament has been debating how the EU is going to work in future, in the looming shadow of Brexit. The UK's vote to leave the EU, last June, came as a seismic shock to most MEPs. And many are quite open in their view that it amounts to a self-destructive decision by the British to uncouple themselves from one of modern history's primary drivers of peace and prosperity.British Eurosceptics of course would cast the Brexit vote in an entirely different light, and now foresee a future in which the UK will be free to make its fortune - and make its own new global trading relationships - unfettered from the dead hand of stifling Brussels bureaucracy.It will be years of course - perhaps many years - before we know who is on the right side of that debate.But one consequence of Brexit is already with us - the EU is now free to debate how it might work in the future without any input from the UK.In theory that should leave Europe's federalists freer to dream than they have been in the past. Britain's voice has generally been raised to question the wisdom and value of further integration that would give EU institutions greater powers at the expense of individual national governments. You would expect such dreams to be articulated best by Guy Verhofstadt - the former prime minister of Belgium, who now leads the liberal bloc in the European Parliament and who will represent that body in Brexit negotiations.In the debate on future reform Mr Verhofstadt said: ""The union is in crisis. The European Union doesn't have much friends: not at home, not abroad. ""The Union does not deliver anymore. Rather than to talk about an 'ever closer union', we have a union of 'too little, too late'. ""That's why people are angry: they see all these European institutions, all these summits, all these empty words, but they don't see enough results.""Mr Verhofstadt has a long list of suggested fixes for this continental malaise, including reducing or ending the right of individual members to opt out of collective decisions - something no British government would ever have countenanced. He has other ideas for how the EU should respond to Brexit too - including moving out of London the headquarters of two EU agencies: the European Banking Authority and the European Medicines Agency.But for now, at least, it seems radical visions for reform will be quietly kicked into touch.The vice-president of the EU Commission, Frans Timmermans, politely welcomed the display of ""vision"" in the proposals, but noted that most of the suggestions would require EU treaty change. He said simply: ""We have to acknowledge that treaty change is not on the top of the political agenda now, in member states in particular.""There are plenty of true believers in the European project who would see in the Verhofstadt proposals the start of a kind of counter-revolution against events which have dismayed them - including Brexit, the US election of Donald Trump and the strong opinion poll showing of insurgent parties in a number of European countries.Populist challenge brings Europe to crossroadsBrexit: All you need to knowBut for now a more cautious and pragmatic approach will prevail - partly because there is a general sense in Strasbourg and Brussels that the European institutions will have enough on their plates negotiating Brexit, without kicking off a parallel process of structural reform which would also take years.That takes us back to the idea that every crisis is an opportunity that shouldn't go to waste.There are, no doubt, those in Strasbourg who take that view - but it seems for the moment they are outweighed by those who feel that when you find yourself in the middle of a crisis - as they would see Brexit - the smartest course of action is to fix the crisis first and worry about the future later."

2017-02-18,Meet the EU's chief Brexit negotiator,https://web.archive.org//web/20170219033155/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37542204,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe British papers love a French villain at the heart of the EU.Is Michel Barnier about to succeed Jacques Delors as the object of their affection? The veteran Gaullist already has form.When he was Commissioner for the Internal Market and Financial Services, Mr Barnier was dubbed ""the most dangerous man in Europe"" after taking on the banking sector and championing a cap on bankers' bonuses. But while he alarmed some in the City, and will probably do so again, he also won grudging respect as a tough but even-handed negotiator.He will need all those skills and more in his new role - chief Brexit negotiator at the European Commission. And having moved seamlessly between big jobs in Paris and Brussels - French foreign minister, Commissioner, MEP - he looks well prepared. ""Don't ask me to tell you what will be at the end of the road, we haven't begun to walk yet,"" he told a conference in Brussels last month. Mr Barnier will stick closely to the official EU position of ""no negotiation without notification"" - waiting for the UK to trigger Article 50 to start the formal process of withdrawal. But he's clearly eager to get going.""I am waiting to begin,"" he said. ""I will be ready tomorrow to negotiate, frankly speaking.""And he will bring with him an instinctive pro-European agenda, and a deep knowledge of the workings of the single market.His deputy as chief Brexit negotiator is a German trade expert, Sabine Weyand, adding to the impression that Mr Barnier will lead a team that means business.One of the biggest challenges he (and his boss Jean-Claude Juncker) faces, is to ensure that representatives of the big member states don't sideline him in the Brexit divorce negotiations.But Mr Barnier's long career in French politics means he could well have the ear of the Elysee Palace, especially if - as looks likely - a centre-right candidate wins the French presidency next year. The stakes are so high that there are bound to be some clashes.Mr Barnier has sparred with the UK's Minister for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, before, when the men both served as Europe ministers in the 1990s. It is another reminder that Michel Barnier is a politician first and foremost, rather than a bureaucrat. There have certainly been criticisms - a dash of vanity, a lack of attention to detail. His career has had plenty of downs as well as ups.But he will defend his European vision to the end, and the British government would do well not to underestimate him.At the height of the eurozone crisis, Mr Barnier always refused (politely) to do broadcast interviews in English.""One wrong word,"" he told me once with a smile, ""and we could move markets.""The next few years will be equally challenging."

Scotland voted 62% in favour of Remain.The conversation online was being driven overwhelmingly by pro-independence campaigners. But people who had supported ""Better Together"" during the Scottish referendum vote also spoke about the possibility of a break-away from the UK as a result of the vote over EU membership.  Perhaps the most significant was Scottish author JK Rowling who tweeted: ""Scotland will seek independence now. Cameron's legacy will be breaking up two unions. Neither needed to happen.""Many took to Twitter to express new or strengthened pro-independence feelings in the wake of the latest vote (Just as a reminder: a ""Yes"" vote in Scotland's 2014 referendum was for independence, while the winning ""No"" campaign backed staying in the UK).One old tweet from 2014's independence referendum gained new life on Friday.

2017-02-19,Lords set to debate Brexit trigger bill,https://web.archive.org//web/20170220054056/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-39020260,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkPeers are to begin debating the bill paving the way for the start of Brexit.MPs agreed the proposed law unchanged, authorising Theresa May to inform the EU of the UK's intention to leave.But the government does not have a majority in the House of Lords and eight amendments have been tabled by Labour's front bench.Opposition and crossbench peers are seeking guarantees about the rights of EU citizens in Britain and the role of parliament in scrutinising the process.Mrs May has said she wants to invoke Article 50 of the 2009 Lisbon Treaty, the formal mechanism by which a state must leave the EU, by the end of March.The government has set aside five days of debate in total for the various stages of the EU (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill - starting with its Second Reading, when the Lords will debate the general principles of the bill.More than 190 peers have requested to speak during Second Reading, which starts at 15.30 GMT and will conclude on Tuesday.Labour says one of its amendments is intended to give parliament a ""final meaningful vote"" on the draft Brexit agreement before MEPs get a chance to do the same. By Ben Wright, political correspondentPeers will not block Brexit. But nor are they likely to wave this bill through without asking the Commons to think again about a number of issues. Peers are certainly keen to have their say in this week's two-day debate. The committee stage scrutiny - and possible votes - will come the week after. And with many non-party cross-benchers in the picture the government cannot be certain of defeating all the changes peers will be pushing for. That would mean the Commons could have to consider the bill again. However, there is no sign the unelected Lords want to go into battle with MPs and the government over Brexit - or meddle with the referendum's mandate. Labour has said it will not frustrate Theresa May's plan to trigger the start of Brexit by the end of next month.The list of likely speakers includes former chancellors Lord Lawson, Lord Lamont and Lord Darling, former foreign secretaries Lord Hague and Lord Owen and former Cabinet Secretaries Lord O'Donnell, Lord Butler and Lord Armstrong.Others expected to contribute include former UKIP leader Lord Pearson and Lord Pannick, the QC who led the successful legal challenge against the government, culminating in the Supreme Court ruling that the prior approval of Parliament was needed before Article 50 was invoked. Detailed scrutiny of the bill at committee stage is due to take place on 27 February and 1 March. If the bill is not amended, then it could theoretically be approved by the Lords at Third Reading on 7 March, becoming law shortly afterwards.If peers do make changes to the bill, it would put them on a collision course with MPs - who overwhelmingly passed the bill unaltered and would be expected to overturn any Lords amendments.Speaking on Sunday, former Labour cabinet minister Lord Mandelson urged peers to show ""courage"" and not wave the bills through without debate.Justice Secretary Liz Truss said she expected the unelected second chamber to respect the ""will of the people"" expressed in last year's referendum.But Lord Hain, a former Northern Ireland Secretary, maintains he has a mandate to seek changes despite being an unelected peer.He said: ""I was appointed by my party. And in the referendum, two thirds of Labour electors voted to Remain. I don't deny they won, or that the outcome has to be respected. But what about the 48% who voted Remain?""Although the Conservatives have the largest number of peers in the Lords, with 252 members, they are vulnerable to being outvoted if opposition peers - including 202 Labour peers and 102 Lib Dems - join forces.Much will hinge of the actions of the 178 crossbenchers in the Lords - who are not aligned to any party and do not take a party whip.Once Article 50 is invoked, there will be up to two years of talks on the terms of the UK's departure and its future relationship with the EU unless all 28 member states agree to extend the deadline."

2017-02-19,Councils warn of cuts despite tax rises,https://web.archive.org//web/20170220054056/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-38982643,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkNearly every local authority in England is planning to raise council taxes this year but council leaders are warning services still face ""deep cuts"". The Local Government Association says funding care for increasing numbers of elderly people is forcing up bills.It says many councils are planning tax increases of up to 4.99% but that cuts to libraries, bin collections and other services will still be needed.The government insists it is giving more money to councils.Social care is a lifeline for people like Maureen Edwards, from Surrey, who said that after she had a fall everyday living was ""difficult"".She said: ""They come in and they get me up in the mornings and they wash me and then they sort of bring me downstairs and I have my breakfast. ""It's just like normal living now, I'm very grateful for all they've done for me.""But such services are being put under strain by the ageing population and budget cuts.Councils are struggling to provide help, feed, wash or get people dressed in their own home or to pay for beds in a care home and the burden often falls on families.  All councils in England can raise council tax by 1.99% in April without having a local referendum. The 151 social care authorities can increase bills by an extra 3% as long as that money goes on social care. The Local Government Association (LGA) says 147 of these have already agreed or are planning to raise the extra money. And three-quarters are set to introduce the maximum hike.However, the LGA says further cuts will still be needed as councils are being pushed ""perilously close to the financial edge"".Warwickshire County Council leader Izzi Seccombe told the BBC: ""To continue it is really looking like we're cutting into the bones of services that matter to people.""It's not just social care. Things like roads, highways, bus services which are subsidised, libraries, access to leisure centres, waste services, children's services as well.""Councils spent £16bn last year on services for elderly and disabled people after funding from central government was cut by a third, in real terms, during the last Parliament.Ms Seccombe said an extra £1.3bn was needed for social care in the next financial year alone. And while the council tax rises would raise about £600m, she said that would be swallowed up by paying current staff more when the National Living Wage comes into effect.Ms Seccombe added: ""We need to put social care on a stable footing.""I'm worried about the impact on vulnerable people in our communities.""[And] I'm worried about what that means for carers who will be left picking up the pieces that local authorities will not be able to manage.""You stay in your own home while getting help with everyday tasks such as washing, dressing and eating.

Instead, as a social care authority, it is going for the maximum 4.99% increase.David McNulty, the council's chief executive, told the BBC: ""We've saved over £450m from our annual running costs over the last six years. ""We're on the way to try and save up to £700m, but we're struggling to balance next year's budget.""I think our services are at breaking point."" Earlier this month, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, the MP for South West Surrey, said tackling social care problems was on the government's agenda.He said: ""The prime minister has been very clear. We recognise the pressure's there. We recognise there is a problem about the sustainability of the social care system.""That has to be addressed and we are going to do that.""A spokesman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said: ""Whilst local authorities - like all public bodies - have had to find efficiency savings, our historic four-year funding settlement gives them the certainty they need to plan ahead with almost £200bn available to provide the services that local people want. ""By the end of this parliament, councils will be able to keep 100% of local taxes. We've also announced an additional £900m for social care meaning councils will have £7.6bn of dedicated funding to spend over the four years."" Follow James on Twitter. "

In the UK, the Jubilee line extension was forecast to cost £2.1 billion, but the bill rose to £3.5bn, partly because of huge cost overruns during construction. Channel Tunnel costs swelled by 80%.John O'Connell, chief executive of the Taxpayers' Alliance, said: ""All the evidence shows that big government projects are delivered way over budget and almost never to deadline, so to allocate tens of billions of taxpayers' money to this white elephant is a big mistake.""In a 2014 paper, Bent Flyvbjerg, Professor of Major Programme Management at Oxford University, laid out what he called the iron law of megaprojects: ""Over budget, over time, over and over again.""Friends of the Earth, who support high-speed rail when it diverts people from flying, say HS2 is the wrong scheme. They complain it doesn't join up to HS1 - the line that joins London to the continent - so doesn't provide the possibility of getting on a train in the North and getting off in Brussels or Paris.Craig Bennett, FoE's director, told BBC News: ""We think the money would be much better spent on a range of much smaller sustainable transport infrastructure projects to deliver real improvements to regular commuters and other train travellers over a far quicker timescale.""""Big infrastructure rarely delivers on its promises. That's why we think Hinkley C nuclear station is also a waste of money. ""For the Hinkley subsidy, you could fund the mother of all national energy efficiency retrofit programmes for millions of homes. That would deliver carbon savings far quicker, would make a real improvement to peoples' lives.""The former Chancellor George Osborne kick-started the drive towards major projects as a way of creating jobs. HS2 is widely supported by councils in the North of England and has received backing by MPs across the parties. The Department for Transport said: ""HS2 will become the backbone of our national rail network - creating more seats for passengers, supporting growth and regeneration and helping us build an economy that works for all.""We are keeping a tough grip on costs and the project is on time and on budget at £55.7bn.""Follow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin"

He urged fellow Labour peers to show ""strength and clarity"" over the issue.Conservative Justice Secretary Liz Truss said Brexit opponents were ""fighting yesterday's battles"".The House of Lords - in which the government does not have an in-built majority - will start considering proposed legislation to leave the EU on Monday. But the former Labour cabinet minister, EU Trade commissioner and Remain campaigner said the ""verbal guarantees"" the government were offering EU citizens in the UK were insufficient.Lord Mandelson told the Andrew Marr programme that the Lords should ""reinstate"" the protections into the bill in the coming weeks.""The government used its majority to bulldoze the legislation through the House of Commons,"" he said. ""I hope it won't be so successful in the House of Lords,"" he said.""At the end of the day the House of Commons, because it is the elected chamber, will prevail but I hope the House of Lords will not throw in the towel early.""But Ms Truss said leaving the EU was the ""settled will"" of the British people and the House of Lords needed to ""get on"" with the process.She told Andrew Marr that once the UK formally notified the EU of its intention to leave by triggering Article 50, she believed the process was ""irrevocable"". Earlier this month, MPs overwhelmingly backed a bill to empower Theresa May to begin the Brexit process. The PM wants to do this by the end of March but needs the approval of both Houses of Parliament first. MPs rejected calls for the status of EU citizens living in the UK and a parliamentary vote on the final terms of exit to be explicitly guaranteed in the bill - although ministers have conceded the Commons will have its say and it fully expects citizens of other EU countries to be able to stay in the UK after Brexit pending negotiations.Lord Mandelson also said some Leave voters who were having second thoughts at the government's ""Brexit at all costs strategy"" needed to have their voice heard.But Ms Truss said Lord Mandelson was speaking as if the referendum ""never happened"".She told Andrew Marr that the House of Commons had ""conclusively"" voted to trigger Article 50, with the majority of Labour MPs backing the government. ""The fact is it is a simple bill on whether we trigger Article 50,"" she said.""The British people have voted for that and was clear in the referendum. ""The House of Lords now needs to get on with it. I fully expect the House of Lords will recognise the will of the people and the House of Commons.""Although she voted to remain in the EU last year, Ms Truss said there was now a ""new reality"" and if a similar vote was held in the future, she would vote to leave.Tory backbencher Dominic Raab warned the Lords would face a backlash if it tried to hold up the Brexit process.""Voters will not look kindly on unelected politicians seeking to obstruct both the result of the referendum, and the vote of their elected representatives in the House of Commons earlier this month,"" he said."

A union welcomed the rise, but said ministers were ""papering over cracks"".The Prison Officers Association (POA) also said the increase was ""divisive"" as it didn't affect all staff.The pay increases  - worth between £3,000 and £5,000 - will apply to ""Band 3"" staff, who make up the majority of front-line officers. A total of £12m will be targeted at prisons in south-east England , such as Wormwood Scrubs, Pentonville, and Belmarsh, which have problems recruiting and retaining their staff.On Thursday, it emerged that in 2016 the number of front-line prison staff in England and Wales had fallen to 17,888, compared to nearly 25,000 in 2010.Justice Secretary Liz Truss told the BBC that such numbers were no longer needed.""The world has changed, we're digitising our prisons, we're running them in different ways,"" she told Andrew Marr.A prison service spokeswoman said digital technology allowed officers to focus on ""the important task of reforming offenders"" - rather than paperwork.In November, a government White Paper said an extra 2,500 prison officers would be in place by the end of 2018.The rise includes an extra 400 officers recruited by March this year. The Ministry of Justice said it was ""on track"" to meet that target, with 389 job offers already made to new recruits.Shadow Justice Secretary Richard Burgon said the Conservative government, and the previous coalition, had made a ""political decision"" to ""decrease frontline prison staff by 6,000"".""That has been the real game changer,"" he said. ""Speaking to prison officers, I know they believe that as well.""The general secretary of the POA, Steve Gillan, said the union had been told about the pay rise on Tuesday, and that ""not a lot of thought"" had gone into it.""We welcome any new money,"" he said, ""but we're a national service.""The union says the pay rise will only apply to 31 prisons, out of more than 100 in England and Wales.Mr Gillan said the increases did not apply to officers on lower grades.He said: ""The lowest-paid people in the service are getting nothing. We pointed that out and there was a deathly silence.""Mr Gillan also said that pay was not the only concern of his members.""The violence in prisons is out of control,"" he said. ""The prisoners are in control, not the staff.""Ms Truss said: ""Prison officers do a challenging and demanding job day in and day out. ""I want front-line staff to know that their work, experience and loyal service is valued. ""We also want to attract the best new talent into the service, ensuring we recruit and retain the leaders of the future.""The 31 prisons involved are: Aylesbury, Bedford, Bullingdon, Coldingley, Cookham Wood, Downview, Elmley, Feltham, Grendon, High Down, Highpoint, Huntercombe, Medway, Send, Stanford Hill, Swaleside, The Mount, Woodhill, Brixton, Belmarsh, Isis, Pentonville, Rochester, Wandsworth, Wormwood Scrubs, Erlestoke, Lewes, Whitemoor, Chelmsford, Guys Marsh and Littlehey.Ministers are due to publish a bill to reform prison and courts this week.The government has said the changes will give prison governors more control over jail management, introduce new performance measures and improve prison education."
2017-02-19,Campaign against Bercow 'undignified',https://web.archive.org//web/20170220054056/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-39020254,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkA campaign to unseat John Bercow as Commons Speaker is ""undignified and unattractive"", a senior Tory has said.Sir Nicholas Soames said he would not sign a motion of no confidence in Mr Bercow, following his opposition to President Trump speaking in Parliament during a future state visit.The MP said Mr Bercow was too outspoken but had been ""very good"" in many ways. Mr Bercow has face criticism from other Conservatives, although only one MP has signed the motion so far.Former Foreign Office minister James Duddridge tabled the early day motion ten days ago, arguing that Mr Bercow had overstepped the mark in voicing his opposition to the US President speaking in Parliament.He said the Speaker's intervention had compromised his neutrality and independence.Although Mr Duddridge is the only signatory so far, focus on the issue is expected to increase when MPs return from their week-long recess on Monday.MPs will debate the merits of President Trump's proposed state visit on Monday when they consider rival public petitions opposing and supporting the event - which is likely to take place later this year.Mr Bercow, who was a Conservative MP before being elected in 2009, will not chair the proceedings as they will be taking place in Westminster Hall, the Commons secondary debating chamber.Sir Nicholas, one of the longest-serving Tories in the Commons, told ITV's Peston on Sunday he was not sure about the strength of feeling on the Tory benches against Mr Bercow, but he would not take part in any no confidence vote, should there be one.""I have had an e-mail from both sides of the argument and I replied no to both of them,"" he said.""John Bercow has in many ways been a very good Speaker. He does tend to shout off on occasions when it would be better if he didn't.""He added: ""I will not be taking part in any campaign, one way or another. ""I think it is a really undignified and unattractive. The Speaker's office is one of the most important in the country.""Several Tories have voiced concerns about Mr Bercow's stance on Mr Trump's visit - which he announced without consulting his counterpart in the House of Lords Lord Fowler. Lord Fowler has said Parliament should keep an ""open mind"" on the issue.There has also been unease over Mr Bercow's recent public declaration that he voted for Remain in last year's EU referendum.When Mr Bercow was first elected, he said he would serve nine years and some Tory MPs have urged him now to clarify his intentions over his future.Downing Street has said the issue of Mr Bercow's future is one for Parliament to decide - a position some observers have interpreted as giving ministers the green light to vote against the Speaker should the matter ever come before MPs.Mr Duddridge's early day motion has no parliamentary force and does not mean the issue of the Speaker's future will be debated in the Commons.Opposition parties remain supportive of Mr Bercow, with Labour MP Liz Kendall telling ITV's Peston on Sunday that there was a ""vendetta"" against Mr Bercow from Conservative MPs who ""just don't like him"".""By having this motion of no confidence, I think they may have made a mistake and people may rally round the Speaker. I certainly will be."""
2017-02-19,Business rates 'need fundamental reform',https://web.archive.org//web/20170220054056/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-39018536,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkSainsbury's chief executive has called for ""fundamental reforms"" to business rates amid concerns hikes could spark a raft of High Street store closures.Mike Coupe said the set-up pegged to property valuations was ""archaic"" and ignored the rise of online shops based in out-of-town warehouses.His comments came after business groups urged ministers to lessen the impact of April's revaluation in England.The government says the majority of firms will pay the same or less.  Properties concentrated in the South East of England and urban centres are said to be disproportionately impacted by the first revaluation since 2010, with retailers in some areas facing rises of up to 400%.There is a similar debate taking place in Scotland and Wales where rates are also being reassessed after April.Reality Check: Are there more winners than losers on business rates?Mr Coupe, the boss of the UK's second-largest supermarket chain, urged the government to undertake a wide-ranging review of the way businesses are taxed, highlighting changes in retailing culture.Mr Coupe said: ""The way it currently stands, there is an advantage for those without bricks and mortar operations, so there's a strong case for a level playing field in business rates and taxation more generally.""Businesses like ours with lots of property and employees face a bigger burden than others.""Referring to the revaluation plans, he said: ""As it stands, we could see High Streets face serious challenges and ultimately more closures. It could impact investment in places that most need it, in areas of the country where there is already a marginal call on investment.""Rates are calculated by multiplying the rateable value of a property by a multiplier set by the government. But as property values change over time, rateable values need to be reassessed periodically - usually every five years.However, this update to property values is two years behind schedule, making it a harder pill to swallow in areas where the price of real estate has been rising. According to analysts, Sainsbury's will see its annual rates rise to £500m, up from £483m, while internet giant Amazon will see its bill cut.Pubs, NHS hospitals and hotels in some areas are also said to be facing increases in their business rates.On Friday, business groups - including the British Retail Consortium and the CBI - signed a letter urging the government to drop the revaluation plans. Pubs and restaurants have also called on the chancellor to dilute the impact of the changes by providing more transitional relief for the sector.Meanwhile, the Sunday Telegraph has reported that ministers considered extra financial support to ease the impact of business rates before the general election in 2015.According to the paper, the Department for Communities and Local Government worked with the Treasury to protect the sector, but eventually decided to adopt more modest reforms.A government spokesman said: ""Nearly three quarters of businesses will see a fall, or no change, in their business rates as a result of the revaluation.""The generous reliefs we are introducing mean that 600,000 small businesses are paying no rates at all - something we're making permanent so they never pay these bills again.""Across the country, there's also a £3.6bn scheme to support companies affected by the business rates revaluation."""

I hate to say that, but it is true,"" he said.Mr Corbyn told reporters at the party's conference on local government at Warwick University on Saturday: ""Well, it's not helpful.""The referendum gave a result, gave a very clear decision on this, and we have to respect that decision, that's why we didn't block Article 50. ""But we are going to be part of all this campaigning, all these negotiations about the kind of relationship we have in Europe in the future.""  He added: ""The referendum happened, let's respect the result. Democracy happened, respect the result.""Mr Corbyn rejected Mr Blair's suggestion that the party was weak, pointing to its surge in membership to more than 500,000.""I don't quite know what Tony means there. Our party membership has more than doubled, we had a big campaign to remain and reform the European Union,"" he said.""We are now pursuing a policy which will try and protect jobs and conditions across this country but also maintain a good relationship with colleagues across Europe.""Mr Corbyn urged Mr Blair to get behind the party's vision of a future outside the European Union with high investment and reduced inequality, rather than a low-tax economy aligned with the US under President Donald Trump.He said: ""We are going to be outside the European Union. We are not leaving the continent of Europe, we are still going to work with them. ""I think it would be helpful if people put their energies in the direction of building those good relations and ensuring we have a viable economy, not some offshore tax haven bargain basement, doing deals with Trump's America.""My job is to take our party forward into an investment-led economy that reduces inequality in this country, that builds houses when people need them, that gets the good jobs people need in the hi-tech industries the National Investment Bank will fund. ""Get on board with that strategy."""

PSA, which includes Peugeot, wants to buy General Motors' loss-making European arm, which includes Vauxhall plants at Luton and Ellesmere Port. There are fears that the deal could lead to job losses.Carlos Tavares, boss of PSA Group, is also set to hold talks with Unite union leader Len McCluskey.The company said it was engaged in a ""constructive dialogue"" with all parties.Vauxhall employs 4,500 workers at the two UK plants, with thousands more involved in its retail and components chain.A Downing Street spokesman said a request for a meeting with Mr Tavares had been received, adding: ""The meeting will take place, in principle, subject to diary availability."" Unite general secretary Mr McCluskey said he was pleased Mr Tavares had ""responded speedily and positively"" to his request for a meeting to discuss Peugeot's intentions.He said he would use the meeting to press the case for the UK's ""world class facilities and workforce"".Apart from meeting the prime minister, PSA will also see Germany's Angela Merkel. It could end up like a corporate beauty parade as Britain and Germany hope to persuade PSA not to shut factories in their respective countries.That's now a real possibility after General Motors said this week that it was in talks to sell its European brands of Opel and Vauxhall to PSA. European car manufacturers have far more production capacity than they need and PSA will probably want to consolidate its factories if it acquires GM Europe.Vauxhall's factories in Ellesmere Port and Luton are both very efficient, but they could face export tariffs when Britain leaves the single market, and probably the customs union, in two years - making those plants unviable.PSA said it was engaged in a ""constructive dialogue"" with all parties in the bid for GM's European division, which includes German-based Opel as well as Vauxhall.A spokesman said: ""Our intention is to establish the same maturity in our exchanges in France, Germany and the UK.""This is why Carlos Tavares has asked to meet Theresa May as it was done with German authorities.""David Bailey, professor of industrial strategy at Aston Business School in Birmingham, told the BBC that a deal would not be straightforward.""I think it's inevitable if this deal goes ahead that there will be plant closures. The plants in the UK look particularly vulnerable because of flexible labour markets and uncertainty over Brexit,"" he said.""So the government I think at some point will have to cut a deal with Peugeot, as it did with Nissan, over things like skills, innovation, rebuilding the supply chain.""And basically, what Nissan got, whatever it was, every other car producer in the UK will be looking for as well."""

The Home Office said securing the status of EU migrants was a priority.Since the referendum in June, many EU citizens have applied for documents guaranteeing the right to live permanently in the UK.But the documents can only be obtained by migrants who have consistently either worked, sought work, or bought the insurance for five years.The Home Office does not remove people for failing to buy insurance, but will not issue them with the guarantee of permanent residence.As EU migrants can use the NHS, many did not realise they needed health insurance. Students and full-time parents are among those affected. They are worried they could be vulnerable after Britain leaves the EU. Tim Strahlendorf moved to the UK from Germany when he was 13. He said he had been refused a residency document because he had spent time studying in the UK without paying for health insurance.He said: ""It never would have occurred to me that anything like this could have happened.""Nina Hofmann, a married language tutor who moved from Germany to the UK in 2006, said her solicitor told her not to apply for residency because she would be refused.She took time out of work to care for her children - Benjamin, 6, and Sophia, 8 - and had not bought health insurance.She told Today: ""It is this fear I could be asked to leave in the end sooner or later. ""Maybe not with a knock on the door but with a letter because I've fallen through the cracks.""Migrants worriedAnother failed applicant for a permanent residence document was told by the Home Office she should make arrangements to leave.The government has since re-worded the letter, and failed applicants are not removed from the country, but many are worried they could be vulnerable after Britain leaves the EU.Liberal Democrat, Labour and crossbench peers want to amend the bill to include a fast track procedure to give EU migrants a reassurance they can live in the UK.The rule change would give people from the European Union, European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland the right to live permanently in the UK, without having to prove they bought insurance. The amendment has been tabled by Liberal Democrat Lord Oates, Labour's Lady Kennedy and crossbench peer Lord Cromwell.It is one of many amendments tabled, but its backers will hope for a concession from ministers as the Lords consider the Article 50 bill.A Home Office spokesman said EU citizens made a vital contribution and securing their status - and those of British nationals elsewhere in the EU - was a priority.He said: ""The rights of EU nationals living in the UK remain unchanged while we are a member of the European Union.""For self-sufficient people or students and their relevant family members, it's always been the case that exercising Treaty rights includes a requirement to have comprehensive sickness insurance and sufficient resources to not become a burden on the social assistance system of the United Kingdom.""According to the Migration Observatory at Oxford University, a quarter of applications for permanent residence documents were refused in 2015. Almost 15,000 EEA nationals received permanent residence documentation in the third quarter of 2016, after the referendum."

2017-02-19,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20170220054056/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThis article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide to the UK's vote to leave the European Union. It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 52% to 48%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who resigned on the day after losing the referendum. Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she says she will respect the will of the people. She has said ""Brexit means Brexit"" but there is still a lot of debate about what that will mean in practice especially on the two key issues of how British firms do business in the European Union and what curbs are brought in on the rights of European Union nationals to live and work in the UK. She set out more details of her negotiating hopes in her key speech on Brexit.The UK economy appears to have weathered the initial shock of the Brexit vote, although the value of the pound remains near a 30-year low, but opinion is sharply divided over the long-term effects of leaving the EU. Some major firms such as Easyjet and John Lewis have pointed out that the slump in sterling has increased their costs. Britain also lost its top AAA credit rating, meaning the cost of government borrowing will be higher. But share prices have recovered from a dramatic slump in value, with both the FTSE 100 and the broader FTSE 250 index, which includes more British-based businesses, trading higher than before the referendum. The Bank of England cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - a record low and the first cut since 2009 - after the vote and there has not been the economic slump or recession that some had predicted. The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it has to invoke an agreement called Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May has said she intends to trigger this process by the end of March 2017, meaning the UK will be expected to have left by the summer of 2019, depending on the precise timetable agreed during the negotiations. The government will also enact a Great Repeal Bill which will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. It is expected to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove.After a court battle, the UK's Supreme Court ruled in January that Parliament must be consulted before Article 50 is invoked. This is why a two line Brexit bill is currently making its way through Parliament. MPs have approved it after Labour MPs were told to support it. It is now heading to the House of Lords to be debated and voted on.Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These men - dubbed the Three Brexiteers - will play a central role in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although it will be Mrs May, as prime minister, who will have the final say. David Cameron's government did not do any emergency planning for Brexit ahead of the referendum and Mrs May has rejected calls to say what her negotiating goals are.Once Article 50 has been triggered, the UK will have two years to negotiate its withdrawal. But no one really knows how the Brexit process will work - Article 50 was only created in late 2009 and it has never been used. Former Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, now Chancellor, wanted Britain to remain in the EU, and he has suggested it could take up to six years for the UK to complete exit negotiations. The terms of Britain's exit will have to be agreed by 27 national parliaments, a process which could take some years, he has argued. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. The UK will continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making.Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Following Theresa May's Brexit recent speech we now know that the UK is not intending to stay in the EU's single market. Although there has been speculation for months about the issue, it would have meant the UK staying under the auspices of the European Court of Justice and having to allow unlimited EU immigration, under freedom of movement rules.Both sides want trade to continue after Brexit with the UK seeking a positive outcome for those who wish to trade goods and services"" - such as those in the City of London and wanting a ""comprehensive free trade deal"" giving the UK ""the greatest possible access"" to the single market. Mrs May says she wants the UK to reach a new customs union deal with the EU. A customs union is where countries agree not to impose tariffs on each others' goods and have a common tariff on goods coming in from elsewhere. The UK is currently part of the EU customs union but that stops the UK being able to do its own trade deals with other countries. Reality Check: How could customs union work?These terms have increasingly been used as debate focused on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people in order to maintain access to the EU single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result.The government has declined to give a firm guarantee about the status of EU nationals currently living in the UK, saying this is not possible without a reciprocal pledge from other EU members about the millions of British nationals living on the continent. EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, will be be able to stay, the chief civil servant at the Home Office has said. The rights of other EU nationals would be subject to negotiations on Brexit and the ""will of Parliament"", he added.A lot depends on the kind of deal the UK agrees with the EU. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions on EU nationals, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.Again, it depends on whether the UK government decides to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages. Citizens' Advice has reminded people their rights have not changed yet and asked anyone to contact them if they think they have been discriminated against following the Leave vote.Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested EU migrants who come to the UK as Brexit nears may not be given the right to stay. He has said there might have to be a cut-off point if there was a ""surge"" in new arrivals.People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote. The day-to-day spending impact is likely to be more significant. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it to remain at least 10% below where it was on 23 June, in the long term. This means imported goods will consequently get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have already been seen and the issue was most notably illustrated by the dispute between Tesco and Marmite's makers about whether prices would be put up or not in the stores.The latest UK inflation figures, for January, showed the CPI inflation rate rising to 1.8%, its highest level for two and a half years, with signs of more cost pressures set to feed through in the months to come.Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration.She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations. As mentioned above, the key issue is whether other EU nations will grant the UK access to the single market, if that is what it wants, while at the same time being allowed to restrict the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK.Mrs May has said she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. It is currently running at 330,000 a year, of which 184,000 are EU citizens, and 188,000 are from outside the EU - the figures include a 39,000 outflow of UK citizens.It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Liberal Democrats - who have just a handful of MPs - have vowed to halt Brexit and keep Britain in the EU if they were to win the next general election.Some commentators, including former House of Commons clerk Lord Lisvane, have argued that a further referendum would be needed to ratify whatever deal the UK hammers out with the EU, but there are few signs political leaders view this as a viable option.Yes. Theresa May has appeared keen to avoid a vote on her negotiating stance, to avoid having to give away her priorities, but Theresa May has said there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. It is worth mentioning that any deal also has to be agreed by the European Parliament - with British MEPs getting a chance to vote on it there.  While there could be limitations on British nationals' ability to live and work in EU countries, it seems unlikely they would want to deter tourists. There are many countries outside the European Economic Area, which includes the 28 EU nations plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway, that British citizens can visit for up to 90 days without needing a visa and it is possible that such arrangements could be negotiated with European countries.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. In theory, the government could, if it wanted, decide to change the colour, which is currently standardised for EU countries, says the BBC's Europe correspondent, Chris Morris.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketNo nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it is ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faces being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. A second independence referendum for the country is now ""highly likely"", she has said, although not in 2017. She has said she wants Scotland to stay in the single market and said Mrs May's decision to rule out the UK staying in the single market ""undoubtedly"" brings the referendum closer.Before his resignation Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said the impact in Northern Ireland would be ""very profound"" and that the whole island of Ireland should now be able to vote on reunification. But, speaking while she was still Northern Ireland Secretary, Theresa Villiers ruled out the call from Sinn Féin for a border poll, saying the circumstances in which one would be called did not exist. The land border is likely to be a key part of the Brexit talks. Theresa May said a priority for her would be negotiating a deal with the EU which allowed a common travel area between the UK and the Republic of Ireland.During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest. But his successor Theresa May has said she will keep it in place, at least for the current Parliament, which is due to last until 2020.So far there has been a cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. There are yet to be signs that rising inflation have worried the Bank of England  enough to consider raising interest rates.  But if that happened it would make mortgages and loans more expensive to repay - but would be good news for savers.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.Eurotunnel boss Jacques Gounon said last November the reintroduction of duty-free would be ""an incredible boost for my business"" but he later said  that remark had been ""light-hearted"". Erik Juul-Mortensen, president of the Tax Free World Association (TFWA) said after the referendum vote ""it is not possible to predict how Brexit will affect the duty free and travel retail industry, and it is wiser not to make assumptions about exactly what the impact will be.""  They are at the moment but no-one knows the longer term prospects for definite. The EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - is not an EU initiative. It was negotiated between countries within a group known as the European Economic Area, often simply referred to as the single market (plus Switzerland, which confusingly is not a member of the EEA, but has agreed access to the single market). Therefore, the future of Britons' EHIC cover could depend on whether the UK decided to sever ties with the EEA.Probably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report. In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two-thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.However, the UK government is committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, the UK government is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR. However, the EU has its own European Court of Justice, whose decisions are binding on EU institutions and member states.Its rulings have sometimes caused controversy in Britain and supporters of a Brexit have called for immediate legislation to curb its powers. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also cited sovereignty and democracy, and they wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Four of the biggest US banks have committed to helping maintain the City's position. But HSBC will move up to 1,000 jobs to Paris, the BBC understands. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Pest control firm Rentokil Initial says it could make £15m extra this year thanks to a weaker currency.Others are less optimistic. Hilary Jones, a director at UK cosmetics firm Lush said the company was ""terrified"" about the economic impact. She added that while the firm's Dorset factory would continue to produce goods for the UK market, products for the European market may be made at its new plant in Germany.Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After the Leave vote, the government will probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""As with most elements of the UK economy, not enough solid data has been published yet to accurately conclude the Brexit effect on house prices. Industry figures have pointed to ""uncertainty"" among buyers and sellers that could potentially change the housing market.So far, the most significant research has come from the respected Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which has published the conclusions of a survey of its members. This primarily records sentiment among surveyors.It found that house prices are expected to fall across the UK in the three months after the referendum vote. However, the dip in prices is only expected to persist over the 12 months from June in London and East Anglia, surveyors predict.House prices were already slowing in central London, owing to the fall-out from changes to stamp duty rules in April.Separate figures from property portal Rightmove suggested the average asking price of houses coming on to the market in England and Wales fell by 0.9%, or £2,647, in July compared with June. It said that agents had reported very few sales had fallen through as a result of the vote.Many potential first-time buyers would welcome a fall in house prices, with ownership among the young falling owing to affordability concerns. Investors in property, or those who have paid off a mortgage and hope to leave homes as inheritance would be unhappy with a long-term reduction in value.  Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law following the decision to leave the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" will not necessarily disappear overnight - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU means the UK will not be part of TTIP. It will have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Former Labour health secretary Lord Owen has said that because of TTIP (see answer above) the only way to protect the NHS from further privatisation was to get out of the EU."

Mr Snell is a member and former leader of Newcastle-under-Lyme Council, who campaigned for a Remain vote in the EU referendum.UKIP, which narrowly beat the Conservatives into second place in the 2015 general election, is fielding its leader, Paul Nuttall, as its candidate. The MEP was born in Bootle, where he has stood in the last three general elections.The Tories have chosen 25-year-old city councillor Jack Brereton. He is the deputy leader of the Conservative Group in the council's ruling coalition, where he is also the Cabinet member for Regeneration, Transport and Heritage. The Green Party has picked Adam Colclough as their candidate, with Zulfiqar Ali standing for the Liberal Democrats.See below for a full list of candidates.The successful Liberal Democrat by-election campaign in Richmond Park in December was seen as a result of the party making Brexit a key issue in what was a very Remain constituency.The wider Stoke area (which includes Stoke Central) voted strongly to Leave in June's referendum so the question is how much of an impact Brexit is likely to have. Since being created for the 1950 general election, Stoke Central has always returned Labour MPs.It has traditionally been seen as rock solid Labour territory and Mr Hunt won in 2015 by a 5,179 margin.Labour's majority has been decreasing sharply in recent years, from 49.5% in 1997 to 16.7% in 2015.Stoke-on-Trent Central covers the administrative centre of the six Potteries towns: Burslem, Fenton, Hanley, Longton, Stoke-upon-Trent and Tunstall.As BBC Midlands political editor Patrick Burns notes, this may be the last time the seat is contested.""For all its rich history and industrial heritage, it's set to be scrapped under proposed Parliamentary boundary changes which would reduce Stoke's present three seats to two,"" he says.""And with (Labour MPs) Ruth Smeeth and Rob Flello apparently in no mood to relinquish their neighbouring seats, it's no wonder that this is being unofficially dubbed as a job for three years.""Mr Nuttall has admitted a previous claim that he lost ""close personal friends"" in the Hillsborough disaster was wrong.The UKIP candidate apologised and said the quotes on his website from 2011 were ""wrong"" and had been taken down.There was also a clash with Labour over whether Mr Nuttall was actually living in the Stoke house registered as his address on nomination papers. UKIP later said he had to leave the house for safety reasons after the address was circulated on social media.Mr Snell, meanwhile, has apologised after some of his old tweets about people appearing on TV shows have re-emerged, including a description of panellists on ITV's Loose Women as ""squabbling sour-faced ladies"" and remarks about Janet Street-Porter and a woman on the BBC's The Apprentice.The Labour candidate also previously posted disparaging remarks about his party's current leader Jeremy Corbyn and Brexit.Here is a list of the candidates, in alphabetical order by surname:Polls open at 07:00 GMT on 23 February and close at 22:00 GMT."

The councillor and former doctor and ambulance driver was chosen from an all-woman shortlist.Up against her for the Conservatives is Trudy Harrison, who lives in the village of Bootle and was a parish councillor for a number of years.UKIP has chosen its 2015 general election candidate, Fiona Mills.The Liberal Democrats have chosen Rebecca Hanson and the Green Party Jack Lenox as their candidates. There are also two independent candidates - Michael Guest and Roy Ivinson.Copeland and its predecessor Whitehaven have been Labour since 1935, but the seat has become more marginal in recent years.Mr Reed, who had been an MP since 2005, held the seat by 2,564 votes from the Conservatives in 2015, with UKIP another 8,038 votes behind in third.The Tories are bidding to become the first governing party to make a by-election gain - not including a 1982 poll triggered by a defecting Labour MP - since 1960.With nearly 11,000 people employed at Sellafield, thousands more in the supply chain and a new power plant proposed in the constituency, the nuclear industry has been a key issue.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's previous opposition to new nuclear power stations has been highlighted by his opponents, although the Labour leader has since given his backing for the £10bn Moorside plant, due to open in 2024.Doubts were raised over the project after Toshiba, which has a 60% share in NuGen, the firm behind the scheme, sustained heavy losses.During a visit to the constituency, Prime Minister Theresa May was asked about union calls for the government to guarantee the investment to ensure the project goes ahead, saying her party ""recognises the importance"" of the nuclear industry.The prime minister also faced questions about the future of Whitehaven's West Cumberland Hospital, with Labour campaigning hard on the future of the maternity unit amid concerns consultant-led services could be moved elsewhere.A key link road, the A595, has also been inspected by both Transport Secretary, Chris Grayling and his Labour counterpart, Andy McDonald, with campaigners calling for urgent improvements to be made.Polls will be open from 07:00 GMT on 23 February until 22:00 BST, with the result expected overnight."
2017-02-19,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20170220054056/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-39007019,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkFormer Prime Minister Tony Blair has launched a campaign to try to persuade the British people to change their minds about leaving the European Union. It comes just weeks before the government intends to trigger the departure mechanism. In a speech in London, he said that he respected the will of the people, but voters hadn't been given details about the terms on which Britain would exit the EU. Mr Blair argued that what he called the ""cost"" of Brexit was only now becoming clear. The referendum vote, he said, was based on ""imperfect knowledge"" which would now become ""informed knowledge"".It's true that we don't yet know the details of the UK's future relationship with the rest of the EU - that will depend on the deal that is negotiated - but lots was said during the referendum campaign about what Brexit would mean in more general terms. In particular, campaigners from both sides said leaving the EU would entail leaving the single market.Mr Blair suggested that immigration was the main issue that propelled Leave to victory in the referendum campaign. But, he argued, the effect of quitting would probably have only a modest impact on overall immigration levels.He pointed out that just over half of migration into the UK comes from outside the EU. That's confirmed by official statistics from the ONS. In the year to June 2016 net migration - the difference between the number of people who arrived and the number of people who left - was 196,000 from outside the EU, compared with 189,000 from inside the EU.The same is true for the gross migration statistics - ie just looking at how many citizens from different parts of the world arrived in the UK.Again, there were slightly more from outside the EU (289,000) than from inside (284,000) along with a smaller number of British citizens returning to live in the UK (77,000). And only an estimated 82,000 or 12.6% of the 650,000 total were EU citizens who arrived looking for work.Theresa May has ruled out introducing a points-based migration system but the government hasn't published details of what it does want to implement. If the new system continues to allow in EU migrants with job offers, as well as students and people coming to join spouses, then Mr Blair's 12% would be, broadly speaking, correct. There could be a bigger impact if the government opts for a capped number of work permits. But about half of total migration will be unaffected no matter what arrangements are made with the EU.This isn't really a fair quotation. It's a reference to an interview given by Philip Hammond on ITV's Peston on Sunday on 26 June.Mr Hammond said: ""I believe it's essential that we protect our access to the single European market. Whether we like it or not, our economy, over 40 years, has become shaped by that access, and to lose that access now would be catastrophic.""But note that he was talking about access to the single market. That's not the same as membership. You don't have to be a member of the single market to have access to it, although the level of access that Britain would have after leaving the single market would depend on what trade relationship was negotiated.It's true that the pound has fallen against the dollar and the euro since the referendum, although not by quite as much as Mr Blair said. It has recovered from its lowest point. Against the dollar, the pound is currently down about 16% compared with its pre-referendum level. Against the euro, it's about 10.5% down.It's also worth noting that the pound/euro exchange rate was at a similar level to now between 2009 and the middle of 2011, so it's hardly unprecedented. Against the dollar, though, the pound has hit multi-decade lows in recent months."
2017-02-19,'Block him out',https://web.archive.org//web/20170220054056/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38096514,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkIf Jenny ever gets married, there will be no dad walking her down the aisle and, if she gets her way, no mention of him on her marriage certificate either.This is because, according to the twenty-something professional, the man who sexually abused her for 18 months from the age of seven ""lost any right to be called my father"".Despite his horrific betrayal of the relationship between father and daughter, the current law gives the option for only his name and occupation to be recorded on her future marriage certificate - but not that of her mother ""who has been mum and dad all wrapped up in one"".This system, of recording only the names of the father of the bride and groom on the certificate, dates back to the early years of Queen Victoria's reign. While either party can ask for a line to be put through that box if they have never known their father or been brought up by a step-father, it's an inequality many people like Jenny feel should be addressed.It is also an issue that has provoked anger among MPs from all parties, who have spent several years attempting to bring about a change in the law to allow both parents to have their names and occupations recorded.Their campaign was given a boost when a petition on Change.org, calling for mothers' names to be added to marriage certificates, collected 70,600 signatures in January 2014. The petition said ""marriage should not be seen as a business transaction between the father of the bride and the father of the groom"".Former Prime Minister David Cameron said later that year that he would address this ""inequality in marriage"", adding that the exclusion of mothers' names from marriage registers in England and Wales did ""not reflect modern Britain"".Mr Cameron was gone from Downing Street before any action was taken and it now seems that Conservative MP Edward Argar's Registration of Marriage Bill is the most likely vehicle to overturn the law.A brief history of marriage:His bill, which would update the Marriage Act of 1949, would move the solely paper-based system to a central electronic register online, which would allow the mother's name to be included.It would also bring England and Wales into line with the rest of the UK. In Scotland and Northern Ireland, couples are asked to give the names of both parents on marriage documentation. The same applies for those entering a civil partnership.Similar attempts by Labour and Conservative MPs to change the law fell in 2015 after failing to get ministers' support. Labour frontbencher Christina Rees' private member's bill focused on the narrow point about putting the mother on the certificate. Former Conservative cabinet minister Dame Caroline Spelman's bill wanted marriages listed in a single electronic register instead of in marriage register books.Former home office minister Richard Harrington said at the time ""a combination"" of the two bills ""could deal with things quickly"".Unlike his predecessors', Mr Argar's bill - which is more like Dame Caroline's attempt - has succeeded in getting government backing because it will create a more secure system for keeping marriage records.""The whole point of this bill is the mothers and fathers of the bride and groom will be registered,"" said the Charnwood MP. ""In the great scheme of things it's a minor change, but it's symbolically very important for a large number of people who want a recognition of the role their mother played in their upbringing.""He added: ""It will also give victims of abuse, children of single mothers or errant fathers, the choice over whether to include their mother's names and not their father's.""You will see virtually no outward change in the form of the marriage ceremony, just in the manner that things are recorded. By moving to an online schedule system, we can easily amend the paper documentation - and it's more secure because it doesn't rely on the old parish register that is at risk of theft from the village church.""The church is supportive of the move, and over time it will save the taxpayer millions of pounds in administrative costs.""The bill is set to return to the Commons for its detailed committee stage after the half-term recess, and Mr Argar is hopeful it will receive Royal Assent - and so become law - by the summer.A spokesman for the Home Office said it wanted to see mothers' names recorded on marriage certificates ""as soon as possible"".Mum's done everythingFor Jenny, whose name has been changed to protect her identity, the law change cannot come soon enough. ""My dad's a rapist and he abused me and my sisters, so I never want any reference to him appearing on anything about my future,"" she said. ""He has no right to that - he lost that right many years ago.""I was only seven when the attacks started, and my siblings were much younger. It ended after I told my mother when I was eight and a half.""I've tried to block out what he did to me. ""I have a partner and I'm sure we will get married eventually, but I don't want my father involved in any way.  I'd only want my mum's name on the marriage certificate because as far as I'm concerned she's done everything for us."""

Sir Peter de la Mare, the Speaker or ""Prolocutor"" of the Good Parliament in April 1376 opened the first day with a long address on the shortcomings of the Crown - military failures, financial and moral corruption. Royal favourites were imprisoned. King Edward III's mistress, Alice Perrers, was condemned to ""seclusion"".  But by the autumn, royalty had fought back. The Parliament was dissolved and most of its work was undone. The King's mistress was back at Court.  The King's son, John of Gaunt, had Sir Peter de la Mare thrown in jail. And the new Speaker was John of Gaunt's own steward, the far more biddable Sir Thomas Huntingford.Until the 17th Century, the Speaker's loyalty was to the Crown rather than to MPs.  But they were often blamed if they delivered news the monarch didn't like.  It could be a dangerous job: seven Speakers were beheaded between 1394 and 1535.  That's why even today a new Speaker traditionally makes a show of being dragged reluctantly to the Chair.Staying on the right side of the Crown was especially tricky during the turmoil of the Wars of the Roses, when it was hard to be sure who would end up being the King.  One Speaker, John Wenlock, tried to hedge his bets by fighting on the side of both the Yorkists and the Lancastrians.   It didn't work out well. He was killed at the Battle of Tewkesbury, allegedly by his own commander who blamed Wenlock's general indecisiveness for the defeat. Gradually, the Speaker's role became one of representing Parliament, rather than the monarch. When Charles I came in person to the Commons on 4 January 1642 to arrest five MPs for treason, Speaker William Lenthall refused to reveal where they were. Hitherto seen as a rather timorous chap, this was his moment. He fell to his knees, but told the King: ""May it please your Majesty, I have neither eyes to see nor tongue to speak in this place but as the House is pleased to direct me, whose servant I am here.""  The King was humiliated and left without the men he'd come for.John Bercow is being criticised by some MPs today for - in their view - failing to be impartial on political issues. But the Speaker's impartiality is a relatively modern notion. In fact, some Speakers held other government offices at the same time.  They could take part in some debates and vote, when they weren't actually presiding over business. Arthur Onslow, who had the job for more than 30 years, began to change that. In fact, he used to boast of his impartiality - to the great irritation and disappointment of the Prime Minister, Sir Robert Walpole, who'd helped him to the job.It wasn't until the Victorian era that our current ideas of impartiality became the norm - though Irish Nationalists in the 1880s felt that Speaker Henry Brand stepped over the line in helping to put down their disruption in the Commons over Irish Home rule. In January 1881, they prolonged debate for 41 hours.  There were disorderly scenes. Irish MPs defied the Chair. And so, Speaker Brand helped the government to invent new procedures, still in use today, to cut the debate short on the Coercion Bill for Ireland.In spite of the controversies, it's almost unprecedented to sack a Speaker. Although in recent times, Michael Martin, was pressured into resigning, the only other one to be ousted forcibly was Sir John Trevor in 1695, who'd been found guilty of accepting a £1,000 bribe.  He also had the disadvantage of being so cross-eyed that MPs couldn't tell if he was giving them the nod to speak, or looking at someone else.And of course, for any MP who tries to oust a Speaker but fails, there's a big risk that in future debates, the Speaker seems strangely unable to see them at all, when they're hoping to be called."
2017-02-19,They said what?,https://web.archive.org//web/20170220054056/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38980742,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkIt was Abraham Lincoln's 208th birthday last weekend. The US Republican Party's social media feeds honoured the 16th president by sharing a picture of his iconic memorial in Washington DC, with an inspiring quote laid over the top. ""In the end, it's not the years in your life that counts, it's the life in your years,"" was the message on Twitter and Instagram, also shared by President Trump.There was just one problem: the words have been attributed to Lincoln many times over the years, but there is no evidence he ever said them. The post has since been deleted.It was the latest example of a growing modern phenomenon, the fake political quote.Some have said ""fake news"" could have swung the outcome of November's US presidential election. Bogus stories like ""Pope Francis Shocks World, Endorses Donald Trump for President"" were extensively shared online.Made up quotes are perhaps more benign than fictitious news stories with a clear political agenda. But they still raise concerns, says James Ball of Buzzfeed News, who is writing a book about ""post-truth"" politics.""If enough people share and believe these fake quotes, then they can contribute to the polarisation of politics, making each side think less of the other, especially as many partisans think fake news is a problem which affects primarily (or only) their opponents.""These fake quotes don't just come from right-wing politicians and activists. In the days after the US election, a quote supposedly taken from a 1998 Donald Trump interview went viral online. ""If I were to run, I'd run as a Republican. They're the dumbest group of voters in the country. They believe anything on Fox News. I could lie and they'd still eat it up,"" the quote said.It seemed too obnoxious to be true - and it was.Fake George Orwell quotes are a specialty in left-wing social media circles. One example is ""during times of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act."" There is no evidence the 1984 author ever said these words, but social media is awash with shareable pictures of them alongside Orwell's monochrome face.So how do bogus quotes like this get into circulation?""Sometimes people just want new followers or shares on social media, and either invent a quote or (naively or otherwise) lift a questionable one,"" says James Ball. ""Others invent quotes as a hoax or parody to show up people they disagree with, or to fire up their own side - or simply to make money from adverts on fake news sites.""The internet means fake quotes can spread very quickly. ""It's easier to fabricate things than it is to debunk them,"" says Rasmus Nielsen, director of research at the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at the University of Oxford. ""As communication gets easier, there is going to be more and more of this stuff floating about online.""Jenni Sargent runs First Draft News, which is working with social media companies and news organisations to look at innovative solutions to the problem.""People are experimenting with the most engaging way to spread false information,"" she says. She wants news websites to come up with entertaining ways of debunking fake facts and quotes.A blue tick next to a name on Twitter tells you the account has been verified as ""authentic"". Sargent wants to come up with ways to highlight unreliable sources, ""like the opposite of a blue tick"".Facebook is introducing tools for German users to flag false stories ahead of that country's parliamentary elections in the autumn. Third-party fact checkers would mark unreliable stories as ""disputed"".The BBC has also said it will fact check deliberately misleading stories ""masquerading as news"".   British MP Damian Collins is chairing a parliamentary inquiry into these issues, which will look at the possibility of news websites having ""verified"" markers. Collins thinks fake quotes attributed to electoral candidates could end up ""distorting the democratic process"".Often verifying quotes is simply a case of rigorously searching through publicly available information, says Kim LaCapria, who works for rumour-busting website Snopes. The volume of dubious content online is greater than ever before, but verification can be easier because far more information is digitised, she says. ""It's actually pretty easy for average social media users to fact check online.""Her job involves looking at outright fake quotes, but also real quotes presented in a misleading way. For example, Al Gore has been ridiculed for claiming he ""invented the internet"". The former vice president did once say ""I took the initiative in creating the Internet,"" but taken in full context, that line seems rather more modest.We are less likely to expend energy verifying a quote which confirms our political beliefs, says LaCapria, an effect which psychologists call confirmation bias.Whether a fake quote comes from the left or the right, it tends to have one common feature, she says. ""It validates our preconceived beliefs or feelings, and that's often proffered as a valid reason to spread it."""
2017-02-19,Race to reform,https://web.archive.org//web/20170220054056/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-38970265,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThere is a theory in politics that times of upheaval and uncertainty present opportunities as well as problems.It's best summed up in the saying that you should never let a good crisis go to waste - an aphorism so seductive that it has been attributed to all the usual historical suspects, from Machiavelli to Winston Churchill.It is perhaps in this spirit that the European Parliament has been debating how the EU is going to work in future, in the looming shadow of Brexit. The UK's vote to leave the EU, last June, came as a seismic shock to most MEPs. And many are quite open in their view that it amounts to a self-destructive decision by the British to uncouple themselves from one of modern history's primary drivers of peace and prosperity.British Eurosceptics of course would cast the Brexit vote in an entirely different light, and now foresee a future in which the UK will be free to make its fortune - and make its own new global trading relationships - unfettered from the dead hand of stifling Brussels bureaucracy.It will be years of course - perhaps many years - before we know who is on the right side of that debate.But one consequence of Brexit is already with us - the EU is now free to debate how it might work in the future without any input from the UK.In theory that should leave Europe's federalists freer to dream than they have been in the past. Britain's voice has generally been raised to question the wisdom and value of further integration that would give EU institutions greater powers at the expense of individual national governments. You would expect such dreams to be articulated best by Guy Verhofstadt - the former prime minister of Belgium, who now leads the liberal bloc in the European Parliament and who will represent that body in Brexit negotiations.In the debate on future reform Mr Verhofstadt said: ""The union is in crisis. The European Union doesn't have much friends: not at home, not abroad. ""The Union does not deliver anymore. Rather than to talk about an 'ever closer union', we have a union of 'too little, too late'. ""That's why people are angry: they see all these European institutions, all these summits, all these empty words, but they don't see enough results.""Mr Verhofstadt has a long list of suggested fixes for this continental malaise, including reducing or ending the right of individual members to opt out of collective decisions - something no British government would ever have countenanced. He has other ideas for how the EU should respond to Brexit too - including moving out of London the headquarters of two EU agencies: the European Banking Authority and the European Medicines Agency.But for now, at least, it seems radical visions for reform will be quietly kicked into touch.The vice-president of the EU Commission, Frans Timmermans, politely welcomed the display of ""vision"" in the proposals, but noted that most of the suggestions would require EU treaty change. He said simply: ""We have to acknowledge that treaty change is not on the top of the political agenda now, in member states in particular.""There are plenty of true believers in the European project who would see in the Verhofstadt proposals the start of a kind of counter-revolution against events which have dismayed them - including Brexit, the US election of Donald Trump and the strong opinion poll showing of insurgent parties in a number of European countries.Populist challenge brings Europe to crossroadsBrexit: All you need to knowBut for now a more cautious and pragmatic approach will prevail - partly because there is a general sense in Strasbourg and Brussels that the European institutions will have enough on their plates negotiating Brexit, without kicking off a parallel process of structural reform which would also take years.That takes us back to the idea that every crisis is an opportunity that shouldn't go to waste.There are, no doubt, those in Strasbourg who take that view - but it seems for the moment they are outweighed by those who feel that when you find yourself in the middle of a crisis - as they would see Brexit - the smartest course of action is to fix the crisis first and worry about the future later."

2017-02-19,Meet the EU's chief Brexit negotiator,https://web.archive.org//web/20170220054056/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37542204,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe British papers love a French villain at the heart of the EU.Is Michel Barnier about to succeed Jacques Delors as the object of their affection? The veteran Gaullist already has form.When he was Commissioner for the Internal Market and Financial Services, Mr Barnier was dubbed ""the most dangerous man in Europe"" after taking on the banking sector and championing a cap on bankers' bonuses. But while he alarmed some in the City, and will probably do so again, he also won grudging respect as a tough but even-handed negotiator.He will need all those skills and more in his new role - chief Brexit negotiator at the European Commission. And having moved seamlessly between big jobs in Paris and Brussels - French foreign minister, Commissioner, MEP - he looks well prepared. ""Don't ask me to tell you what will be at the end of the road, we haven't begun to walk yet,"" he told a conference in Brussels last month. Mr Barnier will stick closely to the official EU position of ""no negotiation without notification"" - waiting for the UK to trigger Article 50 to start the formal process of withdrawal. But he's clearly eager to get going.""I am waiting to begin,"" he said. ""I will be ready tomorrow to negotiate, frankly speaking.""And he will bring with him an instinctive pro-European agenda, and a deep knowledge of the workings of the single market.His deputy as chief Brexit negotiator is a German trade expert, Sabine Weyand, adding to the impression that Mr Barnier will lead a team that means business.One of the biggest challenges he (and his boss Jean-Claude Juncker) faces, is to ensure that representatives of the big member states don't sideline him in the Brexit divorce negotiations.But Mr Barnier's long career in French politics means he could well have the ear of the Elysee Palace, especially if - as looks likely - a centre-right candidate wins the French presidency next year. The stakes are so high that there are bound to be some clashes.Mr Barnier has sparred with the UK's Minister for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, before, when the men both served as Europe ministers in the 1990s. It is another reminder that Michel Barnier is a politician first and foremost, rather than a bureaucrat. There have certainly been criticisms - a dash of vanity, a lack of attention to detail. His career has had plenty of downs as well as ups.But he will defend his European vision to the end, and the British government would do well not to underestimate him.At the height of the eurozone crisis, Mr Barnier always refused (politely) to do broadcast interviews in English.""One wrong word,"" he told me once with a smile, ""and we could move markets.""The next few years will be equally challenging."

Scotland voted 62% in favour of Remain.The conversation online was being driven overwhelmingly by pro-independence campaigners. But people who had supported ""Better Together"" during the Scottish referendum vote also spoke about the possibility of a break-away from the UK as a result of the vote over EU membership.  Perhaps the most significant was Scottish author JK Rowling who tweeted: ""Scotland will seek independence now. Cameron's legacy will be breaking up two unions. Neither needed to happen.""Many took to Twitter to express new or strengthened pro-independence feelings in the wake of the latest vote (Just as a reminder: a ""Yes"" vote in Scotland's 2014 referendum was for independence, while the winning ""No"" campaign backed staying in the UK).One old tweet from 2014's independence referendum gained new life on Friday.

2017-02-20,"Respect Brexit decision, peers urged",https://web.archive.org//web/20170220231941/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-39020260,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkPeers have been urged to ""respect"" voters' decision to leave the EU as they began debating the Brexit bill.With Prime Minister Theresa May taking the unusual step of sitting in the Lords to watch the opening speeches, Leader of the House Baroness Evans said peers must not ""frustrate"" Brexit.But Labour said ""reasonable changes"" could take place to the bill.MPs have already backed the proposed law, authorising Mrs May to inform the EU of the UK's intention to leave.The government does not have a majority in the House of Lords where a record 190 peers are due to speak, with the sitting extended to midnight.Opposition and crossbench peers are seeking guarantees about the rights of EU citizens in Britain and the role of parliament in scrutinising the process.Mrs May has said she wants to invoke Article 50 of the 2009 Lisbon Treaty - the formal two-year mechanism by which a state must leave the EU - by the end of March, and the government has warned the House of Lords not to frustrate the process.The prime minister decided to sit in the Lords chamber itself to listen to the start of the debate. Her official spokesman said this was ""in recognition of the importance of this bill as it proceeds through the Lords"".Opening proceedings, Lady Evans said the government had promised to deliver on the result of last year's referendum, in which 51.9% of voters backed Brexit.She said: ""This bill is not about revisiting the debate."" She added: ""Noble Lords respect the primacy of the elected House and the decision of the British people on 23 June last year.""Lady Evans also said: ""This bill is not the place to try and shape the terms of our exit, restrict the government's hand before in enters into complex negotiations or attempt to re-run the referendum.""For Labour, Lords opposition leader Baroness Smith of Basildon said the government would not be given a ""blank cheque"" and that ""if sovereignty is to mean anything, it has to mean parliamentary responsibility"".She promised to make ministers consider ""reasonable changes"" and this was not ""delaying the process"" but ""part of the process"" of Brexit.But Lord Newby, leader of the Liberal Democrats in the Lords, said the bill could be changed and sent back to the House of Commons for reconsideration, arguing there was a ""world of difference between blocking... and seeking to amend it"".The government's approach was ""little short of disastrous"" and ""to sit on our hands in these circumstances is unthinkable and unconscionable"", he added.UKIP's Lord Stevens of Ludgate said the prime minister ""should be congratulated"" for ""honouring"" the commitment to leave the EU, following the referendum.But he told peers it was better to ""leave the EU quickly"", rather than enter negotiations with member states on a post-Brexit deal.And Labour peer Lord Howarth of Newport, who backed Brexit, said: ""All of us should respect the democratic decision to leave. If we do not, public disaffection from politics will become a crisis. Those who meditate a second referendum are playing with fire.""By Ben Wright, political correspondentPeers will not block Brexit. But nor are they likely to wave this bill through without asking the Commons to think again about a number of issues. Peers are certainly keen to have their say in this week's two-day debate. The committee stage scrutiny - and possible votes - will come the week after. And with many non-party cross-benchers in the picture the government cannot be certain of defeating all the changes peers will be pushing for. That would mean the Commons could have to consider the bill again. However, there is no sign the unelected Lords want to go into battle with MPs and the government over Brexit - or meddle with the referendum's mandate. Labour has said it will not frustrate Theresa May's plan to trigger the start of Brexit by the end of next month.The government has set aside five days in total to discuss the various stages of the EU (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill - starting with its Second Reading, in which peers debate the general principles of the bill.The Second Reading debate is due to conclude on Tuesday evening - possibly with a vote, but only if peers break with their usual practice of allowing government legislation through unopposed at this stage.Although amendments are not voted on at this stage, speeches will be closely watched for signs of the mood of peers on the two key ones of parliament having a ""final meaningful vote"" on the draft Brexit agreement - and guaranteeing the rights of EU citizens in the UK. Detailed scrutiny of the bill at committee stage is due to take place on 27 February and 1 March. If the bill is not amended, then it could theoretically be approved by the Lords at Third Reading on 7 March, becoming law shortly afterwards.If peers do make changes to the bill, it would put them on a collision course with MPs - who overwhelmingly passed the bill unaltered and would be expected to overturn any Lords amendments.Although the Conservatives have the largest number of peers in the Lords, with 252 members, they are vulnerable to being outvoted if opposition peers - including 202 Labour peers and 102 Lib Dems - join forces.Much will hinge of the actions of the 178 crossbenchers in the Lords - who are not aligned to any party and do not take a party whip.Once Article 50 is invoked, there will be up to two years of talks on the terms of the UK's departure and its future relationship with the EU unless all 28 member states agree to extend the deadline."

As far as I know I've never spoken like that and no friends of mine have ever spoken like that - I completely deplore it and find it ridiculous to speak like that in private.""All I'm saying is most of us would be rather embarrassed if everything that we said in private in our past (was broadcast).""Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan responded to the debate for the government, saying: ""We believe it is absolutely right that we should use all the tools at our disposal to build common ground with President Trump.""The visit should happen. The visit will happen. And when it does, I trust the United Kingdom will extend a polite and generous welcome to President Donald Trump.""Outside, a group of anti-Trump protesters gathered in Parliament Square.Similar demonstrations were organised elsewhere around the UK, including in Edinburgh, Manchester, Liverpool, Cardiff and Newcastle.Prime Minister Theresa May announced the state visit during a visit to Washington for talks with Mr Trump.It led to petitions titled Prevent Donald Trump from making a State Visit to the United Kingdom and Donald Trump should make a State Visit to the United Kingdom.Commons Speaker John Bercow was criticised by some MPs after he said Mr Trump should not address Parliament during the trip in light of the row over his travel ban and comments about women.Mr Trump was invited to the UK for a state visit after just seven days as president, while it took 758 days for Barack Obama and 978 days for George W Bush.The government has said it recognised the ""strong views"" expressed by the US president but looked forward to welcoming him once details have been arranged."

The NHS's underlying financial position is not sustainable,"" he added.The NHS is in the middle of the tightest financial settlement since it was created. Since 2010 the budget has been rising by a little more than 1% on average compared to more than 4% during the rest of its history.Read more from NickFollow Nick on Twitter"

""We have a very strong domestic market and Vauxhall has a large share of that - something PSA recognises,"" said Mr Clark.""One of the points the PSA executives made to me was that since the new management of PSA has been in place, they have taken some pride in having part of their strategy not to close plants,"" he added.Meanwhile, Germany's deputy economy minister, Matthias Machnig, said that GM and PSA were yet to give any binding guarantees on German jobs, but that there had been some encouraging signs.Vauxhall employs abut 4,500 workers in the UK, making cars in Ellesmere Port and vans in Luton.Mr Clark sidestepped a question about whether any sweeteners were on offer to ensure that the PSA Group - if it takes over the loss-making GM businesses in Europe - will maintain manufacturing in the UK.However, he said the UK car industry was very competitive, had a flexible workforce, and was investing in technology. ""The UK is a beacon of success in this, and other, industries,"" Mr Clark said.""From my initial conversations [with PSA and General Motors] I think it is understood that Vauxhall's plants are very efficient,"" he added.Asked by Labour MP Pat McFadden about the future of the UK's supply chain for the car industry, the minister hailed the UK's competitive car parts sector.

2017-02-20,Councils warn of cuts despite tax rises,https://web.archive.org//web/20170220231941/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-38982643,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkCouncil leaders are warning of deep cuts to services despite nearly every local authority in England planning to raise council tax in 2017. Increases of up to 4.99% are expected across the country, but libraries, bin collections and other services will still face funding gaps.  The Local Government Association says the cost of care for increasing numbers of elderly people is forcing up bills.The government insists it is giving more money to councils. The Department for Communities and Local Government said local authorities had been given a ""historic"" four-year settlement, giving them the certainty they needed to plan ahead, with almost £200bn available ""to provide the services that local people want"".All councils in England can raise council tax by 1.99% in April without having a local referendum.The 151 social care authorities can increase bills by an extra 3% as long as that money goes on social care.The Local Government Association (LGA) says 147 of these have already agreed or are planning to raise the extra money. And three-quarters are set to introduce the maximum hike.Some residents will see even higher rises, as council tax regulations say the cap is based on the average council tax across the area, rather than a maximum for each household.However, the LGA says further cuts will still be needed as councils are being pushed ""perilously close to the financial edge"".What's the deal with council tax increases?Warwickshire County Council leader Izzi Seccombe told the BBC: ""To continue it is really looking like we're cutting into the bones of services that matter to people.""It's not just social care. Things like roads, highways, bus services which are subsidised, libraries, access to leisure centres, waste services, children's services as well.""All local authorities in England can raise council tax by up to 1.99% in April. Any higher, and they would need to hold a referendum to get residents to agree with the hike before they could put it in place.  But the 151 social care authorities - England's county councils and unitary authorities, which cover the whole population - can also increase bills by an extra 3%. This additional charge - known as a social care precept - was introduced by George Osborne in 2015 to allow local authorities to raise extra money to specifically pay for social care. Added together, this means most people in England will be looking at a 4.99% rise in council tax in the coming year. Some people will pay more as the 4.99% cap only has to be the ""average"" rise across the area. So for Swindon Borough Council, for example, householders in some council tax bands will see a 3.12% rise, whilst others will see a 7.28% rise - with the average staying within the rules. Many councils say no and their difficulty stems from a change in the way local services are funded. Money from central government has been cut after local authorities were told to change the way they are funded. In future, they will use council tax and business rates collected locally to pay for services, rather than rely on government grants.By 2020, the grants will be phased out entirely. But the LGA says councils are being pushed ""perilously close to the financial edge"" by the change and even with the extra money from their residents, they will still need to make cuts to balance the books. As councils across England tighten their belts, there is a huge raft of services that could be squeezed further.The services they provide range from running recycling centres and organising bin collections through to tackling anti-social behaviour and controlling adoption services. Mrs Seccombe said: ""Year on year it is roads and highways and grass cutting that tops the list [of priorities] as these are things that people have to deal with every day.""Even these priorities could be looking at cost savings, as well as children's services, leisure centres, transport projects and whatever else each council is responsible for. Councils spent £16bn last year on services for elderly and disabled people after funding from central government was cut by a third, in real terms, during the last Parliament.Mrs Seccombe said an extra £1.3bn was needed for social care in the next financial year alone. And while the council tax rises would raise about £600m, she said that would be swallowed up by paying higher wages to existing staff more when the National Living Wage comes into effect.Lord Porter, chairman of the LGA, said social care faced a funding gap of £2.6bn by 2020.""Extra council tax income will not bring in anywhere near enough money to alleviate the growing pressure on social care both now and in the future and the social care precept raises different amounts of money in different parts of the country,"" he said. But the government insists it has increased funding for social care by an additional £900m, meaning councils will have £7.6bn of dedicated funding to spend over the four-year period.In Scotland, a nine year-long national council tax freeze comes to an end this year and councillors will have the power to raise the basic bill by as much as 3%. Each of its 32 authorities will be announcing their planned rises in the coming weeks.Wales is facing similar pressures, especially with the cost of social care, but the country's social services minister told BBC Wales that increasing council tax was not ""fair"" and ""not an approach we're taking"".Rebecca Evans said Welsh ministers wanted to take a longer-term approach towards social care funding but added: ""We do need the UK government to help us with this"".Social care is a lifeline for people like Maureen Edwards, from Surrey, who said that after she had a fall everyday living was ""difficult"".She said: ""They come in and they get me up in the mornings and they wash me and then they sort of bring me downstairs and I have my breakfast. ""It's just like normal living now, I'm very grateful for all they've done for me.""But such services are being put under strain by the ageing population and budget cuts.Councils are struggling to provide help, feed, wash or get people dressed in their own home or to pay for beds in a care home and the burden often falls on families.

Councils can step in to settle disputes, and can issue enforcement orders to hedge owners or even carry out work themselves.Mr Doris said the committee wanted to examine how well the legislation has worked in the three years since it came into force.He said: ""While it can be a rare occurrence, overgrown hedges can be a serious nuisance - especially when they lead to disagreements or 'hedge rage' disputes between neighbours.""What our committee wants to know is whether the Act is working in practice. We want to hear from those with experience in this area so that we can give a considered view to the wider parliament on whether or not the Act could be improved."""

In the UK, the Jubilee line extension was forecast to cost £2.1 billion, but the bill rose to £3.5bn, partly because of huge cost overruns during construction. Channel Tunnel costs swelled by 80%.John O'Connell, chief executive of the Taxpayers' Alliance, said: ""All the evidence shows that big government projects are delivered way over budget and almost never to deadline, so to allocate tens of billions of taxpayers' money to this white elephant is a big mistake.""In a 2014 paper, Bent Flyvbjerg, Professor of Major Programme Management at Oxford University, laid out what he called the iron law of megaprojects: ""Over budget, over time, over and over again.""Friends of the Earth, who support high-speed rail when it diverts people from flying, say HS2 is the wrong scheme. They complain it doesn't join up to HS1 - the line that joins London to the continent - so doesn't provide the possibility of getting on a train in the North and getting off in Brussels or Paris.Craig Bennett, FoE's director, told BBC News: ""We think the money would be much better spent on a range of much smaller sustainable transport infrastructure projects to deliver real improvements to regular commuters and other train travellers over a far quicker timescale.""""Big infrastructure rarely delivers on its promises. That's why we think Hinkley C nuclear station is also a waste of money. ""For the Hinkley subsidy, you could fund the mother of all national energy efficiency retrofit programmes for millions of homes. That would deliver carbon savings far quicker, would make a real improvement to peoples' lives.""The former Chancellor George Osborne kick-started the drive towards major projects as a way of creating jobs. HS2 is widely supported by councils in the North of England and has received backing by MPs across the parties. The Department for Transport said: ""HS2 will become the backbone of our national rail network - creating more seats for passengers, supporting growth and regeneration and helping us build an economy that works for all.""We are keeping a tough grip on costs and the project is on time and on budget at £55.7bn.""Follow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin"

""Where there is evidence of a member being a member of another political party, that member will be auto-excluded."" It is understood Mr O'Cofaigh and Mr Gannon intend to appeal the decision."

It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 52% to 48%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who resigned on the day after losing the referendum. Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she says she will respect the will of the people. She has said ""Brexit means Brexit"" but there is still a lot of debate about what that will mean in practice especially on the two key issues of how British firms do business in the European Union and what curbs are brought in on the rights of European Union nationals to live and work in the UK. She set out more details of her negotiating hopes in her key speech on Brexit.The UK economy appears to have weathered the initial shock of the Brexit vote, although the value of the pound remains near a 30-year low, but opinion is sharply divided over the long-term effects of leaving the EU. Some major firms such as Easyjet and John Lewis have pointed out that the slump in sterling has increased their costs. Britain also lost its top AAA credit rating, meaning the cost of government borrowing will be higher. But share prices have recovered from a dramatic slump in value, with both the FTSE 100 and the broader FTSE 250 index, which includes more British-based businesses, trading higher than before the referendum. The Bank of England cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - a record low and the first cut since 2009 - after the vote and there has not been the economic slump or recession that some had predicted. The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it has to invoke an agreement called Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May has said she intends to trigger this process by the end of March 2017, meaning the UK will be expected to have left by the summer of 2019, depending on the precise timetable agreed during the negotiations. The government will also enact a Great Repeal Bill which will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. It is expected to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove.After a court battle, the UK's Supreme Court ruled in January that Parliament must be consulted before Article 50 is invoked. This is why a two line Brexit bill is currently making its way through Parliament. MPs have approved it after Labour MPs were told to support it. It is now heading to the House of Lords to be debated and voted on.Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These men - dubbed the Three Brexiteers - will play a central role in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although it will be Mrs May, as prime minister, who will have the final say. David Cameron's government did not do any emergency planning for Brexit ahead of the referendum and Mrs May has rejected calls to say what her negotiating goals are.Once Article 50 has been triggered, the UK will have two years to negotiate its withdrawal. But no one really knows how the Brexit process will work - Article 50 was only created in late 2009 and it has never been used. Former Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, now Chancellor, wanted Britain to remain in the EU, and he has suggested it could take up to six years for the UK to complete exit negotiations. The terms of Britain's exit will have to be agreed by 27 national parliaments, a process which could take some years, he has argued. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. The UK will continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making.Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Following Theresa May's Brexit recent speech we now know that the UK is not intending to stay in the EU's single market. Although there has been speculation for months about the issue, it would have meant the UK staying under the auspices of the European Court of Justice and having to allow unlimited EU immigration, under freedom of movement rules.Both sides want trade to continue after Brexit with the UK seeking a positive outcome for those who wish to trade goods and services"" - such as those in the City of London and wanting a ""comprehensive free trade deal"" giving the UK ""the greatest possible access"" to the single market. Mrs May says she wants the UK to reach a new customs union deal with the EU. A customs union is where countries agree not to impose tariffs on each others' goods and have a common tariff on goods coming in from elsewhere. The UK is currently part of the EU customs union but that stops the UK being able to do its own trade deals with other countries. Reality Check: How could customs union work?These terms have increasingly been used as debate focused on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people in order to maintain access to the EU single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result.The government has declined to give a firm guarantee about the status of EU nationals currently living in the UK, saying this is not possible without a reciprocal pledge from other EU members about the millions of British nationals living on the continent. EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, will be be able to stay, the chief civil servant at the Home Office has said. The rights of other EU nationals would be subject to negotiations on Brexit and the ""will of Parliament"", he added.A lot depends on the kind of deal the UK agrees with the EU. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions on EU nationals, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.Again, it depends on whether the UK government decides to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages. Citizens' Advice has reminded people their rights have not changed yet and asked anyone to contact them if they think they have been discriminated against following the Leave vote.Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested EU migrants who come to the UK as Brexit nears may not be given the right to stay. He has said there might have to be a cut-off point if there was a ""surge"" in new arrivals.People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote. The day-to-day spending impact is likely to be more significant. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it to remain at least 10% below where it was on 23 June, in the long term. This means imported goods will consequently get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have already been seen and the issue was most notably illustrated by the dispute between Tesco and Marmite's makers about whether prices would be put up or not in the stores.The latest UK inflation figures, for January, showed the CPI inflation rate rising to 1.8%, its highest level for two and a half years, with signs of more cost pressures set to feed through in the months to come.Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration.She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations. As mentioned above, the key issue is whether other EU nations will grant the UK access to the single market, if that is what it wants, while at the same time being allowed to restrict the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK.Mrs May has said she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. It is currently running at 330,000 a year, of which 184,000 are EU citizens, and 188,000 are from outside the EU - the figures include a 39,000 outflow of UK citizens.It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Liberal Democrats - who have just a handful of MPs - have vowed to halt Brexit and keep Britain in the EU if they were to win the next general election.Some commentators, including former House of Commons clerk Lord Lisvane, have argued that a further referendum would be needed to ratify whatever deal the UK hammers out with the EU, but there are few signs political leaders view this as a viable option.Yes. Theresa May has appeared keen to avoid a vote on her negotiating stance, to avoid having to give away her priorities, but Theresa May has said there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. It is worth mentioning that any deal also has to be agreed by the European Parliament - with British MEPs getting a chance to vote on it there.  While there could be limitations on British nationals' ability to live and work in EU countries, it seems unlikely they would want to deter tourists. There are many countries outside the European Economic Area, which includes the 28 EU nations plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway, that British citizens can visit for up to 90 days without needing a visa and it is possible that such arrangements could be negotiated with European countries.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. In theory, the government could, if it wanted, decide to change the colour, which is currently standardised for EU countries, says the BBC's Europe correspondent, Chris Morris.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketNo nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it is ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faces being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. A second independence referendum for the country is now ""highly likely"", she has said, although not in 2017. She has said she wants Scotland to stay in the single market and said Mrs May's decision to rule out the UK staying in the single market ""undoubtedly"" brings the referendum closer.Before his resignation Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said the impact in Northern Ireland would be ""very profound"" and that the whole island of Ireland should now be able to vote on reunification. But, speaking while she was still Northern Ireland Secretary, Theresa Villiers ruled out the call from Sinn Féin for a border poll, saying the circumstances in which one would be called did not exist. The land border is likely to be a key part of the Brexit talks. Theresa May said a priority for her would be negotiating a deal with the EU which allowed a common travel area between the UK and the Republic of Ireland.During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest. But his successor Theresa May has said she will keep it in place, at least for the current Parliament, which is due to last until 2020.So far there has been a cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. There are yet to be signs that rising inflation have worried the Bank of England  enough to consider raising interest rates.  But if that happened it would make mortgages and loans more expensive to repay - but would be good news for savers.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.Eurotunnel boss Jacques Gounon said last November the reintroduction of duty-free would be ""an incredible boost for my business"" but he later said  that remark had been ""light-hearted"". Erik Juul-Mortensen, president of the Tax Free World Association (TFWA) said after the referendum vote ""it is not possible to predict how Brexit will affect the duty free and travel retail industry, and it is wiser not to make assumptions about exactly what the impact will be.""  They are at the moment but no-one knows the longer term prospects for definite. The EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - is not an EU initiative. It was negotiated between countries within a group known as the European Economic Area, often simply referred to as the single market (plus Switzerland, which confusingly is not a member of the EEA, but has agreed access to the single market). Therefore, the future of Britons' EHIC cover could depend on whether the UK decided to sever ties with the EEA.Probably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report. In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two-thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.However, the UK government is committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, the UK government is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR. However, the EU has its own European Court of Justice, whose decisions are binding on EU institutions and member states.Its rulings have sometimes caused controversy in Britain and supporters of a Brexit have called for immediate legislation to curb its powers. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also cited sovereignty and democracy, and they wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Four of the biggest US banks have committed to helping maintain the City's position. But HSBC will move up to 1,000 jobs to Paris, the BBC understands. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Pest control firm Rentokil Initial says it could make £15m extra this year thanks to a weaker currency.Others are less optimistic. Hilary Jones, a director at UK cosmetics firm Lush said the company was ""terrified"" about the economic impact. She added that while the firm's Dorset factory would continue to produce goods for the UK market, products for the European market may be made at its new plant in Germany.Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After the Leave vote, the government will probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""As with most elements of the UK economy, not enough solid data has been published yet to accurately conclude the Brexit effect on house prices. Industry figures have pointed to ""uncertainty"" among buyers and sellers that could potentially change the housing market.So far, the most significant research has come from the respected Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which has published the conclusions of a survey of its members. This primarily records sentiment among surveyors.It found that house prices are expected to fall across the UK in the three months after the referendum vote. However, the dip in prices is only expected to persist over the 12 months from June in London and East Anglia, surveyors predict.House prices were already slowing in central London, owing to the fall-out from changes to stamp duty rules in April.Separate figures from property portal Rightmove suggested the average asking price of houses coming on to the market in England and Wales fell by 0.9%, or £2,647, in July compared with June. It said that agents had reported very few sales had fallen through as a result of the vote.Many potential first-time buyers would welcome a fall in house prices, with ownership among the young falling owing to affordability concerns. Investors in property, or those who have paid off a mortgage and hope to leave homes as inheritance would be unhappy with a long-term reduction in value.  Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law following the decision to leave the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" will not necessarily disappear overnight - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU means the UK will not be part of TTIP. It will have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Former Labour health secretary Lord Owen has said that because of TTIP (see answer above) the only way to protect the NHS from further privatisation was to get out of the EU."

Mr Snell is a member and former leader of Newcastle-under-Lyme Council, who campaigned for a Remain vote in the EU referendum.UKIP, which narrowly beat the Conservatives into second place in the 2015 general election, is fielding its leader, Paul Nuttall, as its candidate. The MEP was born in Bootle, where he has stood in the last three general elections.The Tories have chosen 25-year-old city councillor Jack Brereton. He is the deputy leader of the Conservative Group in the council's ruling coalition, where he is also the Cabinet member for Regeneration, Transport and Heritage. The Green Party has picked Adam Colclough as their candidate, with Zulfiqar Ali standing for the Liberal Democrats.See below for a full list of candidates.The successful Liberal Democrat by-election campaign in Richmond Park in December was seen as a result of the party making Brexit a key issue in what was a very Remain constituency.The wider Stoke area (which includes Stoke Central) voted strongly to Leave in June's referendum so the question is how much of an impact Brexit is likely to have. Since being created for the 1950 general election, Stoke Central has always returned Labour MPs.It has traditionally been seen as rock solid Labour territory and Mr Hunt won in 2015 by a 5,179 margin.Labour's majority has been decreasing sharply in recent years, from 49.5% in 1997 to 16.7% in 2015.Stoke-on-Trent Central covers the administrative centre of the six Potteries towns: Burslem, Fenton, Hanley, Longton, Stoke-upon-Trent and Tunstall.As BBC Midlands political editor Patrick Burns notes, this may be the last time the seat is contested.""For all its rich history and industrial heritage, it's set to be scrapped under proposed Parliamentary boundary changes which would reduce Stoke's present three seats to two,"" he says.""And with (Labour MPs) Ruth Smeeth and Rob Flello apparently in no mood to relinquish their neighbouring seats, it's no wonder that this is being unofficially dubbed as a job for three years.""Mr Nuttall has admitted a previous claim that he lost ""close personal friends"" in the Hillsborough disaster was wrong.The UKIP candidate apologised and said the quotes on his website from 2011 were ""wrong"" and had been taken down.There was also a clash with Labour over whether Mr Nuttall was actually living in the Stoke house registered as his address on nomination papers. UKIP later said he had to leave the house for safety reasons after the address was circulated on social media.Mr Snell, meanwhile, has apologised after some of his old tweets about people appearing on TV shows have re-emerged, including a description of panellists on ITV's Loose Women as ""squabbling sour-faced ladies"" and remarks about Janet Street-Porter and a woman on the BBC's The Apprentice.The Labour candidate also previously posted disparaging remarks about his party's current leader Jeremy Corbyn and Brexit.Here is a list of the candidates, in alphabetical order by surname:Polls open at 07:00 GMT on 23 February and close at 22:00 GMT."

The councillor and former doctor and ambulance driver was chosen from an all-woman shortlist.Up against her for the Conservatives is Trudy Harrison, who lives in the village of Bootle and was a parish councillor for a number of years.UKIP has chosen its 2015 general election candidate, Fiona Mills.The Liberal Democrats have chosen Rebecca Hanson and the Green Party Jack Lenox as their candidates. There are also two independent candidates - Michael Guest and Roy Ivinson.Copeland and its predecessor Whitehaven have been Labour since 1935, but the seat has become more marginal in recent years.Mr Reed, who had been an MP since 2005, held the seat by 2,564 votes from the Conservatives in 2015, with UKIP another 8,038 votes behind in third.The Tories are bidding to become the first governing party to make a by-election gain - not including a 1982 poll triggered by a defecting Labour MP - since 1960.With nearly 11,000 people employed at Sellafield, thousands more in the supply chain and a new power plant proposed in the constituency, the nuclear industry has been a key issue.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's previous opposition to new nuclear power stations has been highlighted by his opponents, although the Labour leader has since given his backing for the £10bn Moorside plant, due to open in 2024.Doubts were raised over the project after Toshiba, which has a 60% share in NuGen, the firm behind the scheme, sustained heavy losses.During a visit to the constituency, Prime Minister Theresa May was asked about union calls for the government to guarantee the investment to ensure the project goes ahead, saying her party ""recognises the importance"" of the nuclear industry.The prime minister also faced questions about the future of Whitehaven's West Cumberland Hospital, with Labour campaigning hard on the future of the maternity unit amid concerns consultant-led services could be moved elsewhere.A key link road, the A595, has also been inspected by both Transport Secretary, Chris Grayling and his Labour counterpart, Andy McDonald, with campaigners calling for urgent improvements to be made.Polls will be open from 07:00 GMT on 23 February until 22:00 BST, with the result expected overnight."
2017-02-20,Jonathan Marcus,https://web.archive.org//web/20170220231941/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39017879,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe Munich Security Conference is at one and the same time an annual jamboree for senior officials and think-tankers and a place where former officials and corporate movers-and-shakers meet up. But it also affords an opportunity for a whole series of behind the scenes bilateral meetings. And once every four years it is the place where Europe takes stock of a new US administration.This year the meeting had added significance since the man in the White House, Donald Trump, is unlike any other president in living memory. His supporters believe he is the man to overturn the ""establishment"" in Washington and to get things done. His detractors believe he is unfit for high office, his erratic behaviour leading some even to question his mental state.Remember this was a man who on the campaign trail described Nato as ""obsolete"" and who said that he would end the free ride that he believed many allies - especially in Europe - were taking at the American taxpayers' expense. So this encounter in Munich was an opportunity for Nato allies to weigh up the new Trump team and to try to gauge the new administration's likely direction. Mr Trump sent his Vice-President Mike Pence to Munich to deliver a series of clearly worded messages. Trump 'unwavering' in support for Nato allies, says PenceWhat does Nato want from Trump?And to avoid any doubt his new defence chief, General James Mattis, provided a warm-up act at Nato headquarters at the end of last week - and to ensure nobody mistakes the message Mr Pence himself will be heading to Brussels, the seat of Nato, once the Munich conference is over. Mr Pence used his Munich speech to bring a message of reassurance from the new president. ""The US,"" he said, strongly supports Nato and will be ""unwavering in its commitment to the trans-Atlantic alliance"" .But with so few allies actually meeting the agreed target for defence spending, there was a warning too. ""Let me be clear on this point,"" he stressed, ""the president of the United States expects our allies to keep their word to fulfil this commitment and for most that means the time has come to do more"".This statement was met with hesitant applause - an indication that many Europeans do not welcome being bullied by the Trump White House. Earlier, German Chancellor Angela Merkel had emphasised that military spending alone was not the only measure of the Europeans' commitment to security.  She calmly - but pointedly - took issue with many of the Trump team's putative policies, noting the importance of international multilateral institutions like the EU and the UN (both of which have been condemned by Mr Trump). Indeed at the end of her speech she seemed to take on the central tenet of the Trump campaign - enshrined in the slogan ""America First!"" Looking to the future she posed a fundamental question. ""Will we be able,"" she asked, ""to act in concert together or (will we) fall back into parochial policies?""One of Europe's greatest fears has been Mr Trump's apparent willingness to do a deal with Moscow - not to mention his evident admiration for Russia's leader Vladimir Putin. Mr Trump's emissaries pretty much convinced their European hosts that on key issues - at least for now - there would be no change. General Mattis insisted that Russia had to abide by international law and US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, on a recent visit to Bonn, stressed that agreements like the Minsk accords to end the fighting in Ukraine had to be fully implemented by all sides - including Moscow. Vice-President Pence emphasised the message saying here in Munich that the US would continue to hold Russia to account, even as it searched for areas of common ground.The Russians have almost been bystanders here watching the internal Nato debate from the sidelines. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov returned to a familiar theme - that Nato was essentially an institution of the past. The expansion of the Atlantic Alliance, he said, had led to an unprecedented level of tensions. What was now needed was what he called a ""post-western world order"". So there seems little chance here for President Trump's hope for fresh understanding with Moscow - or at the very least that it will not come at the expense of the European Nato allies, or perhaps even of Ukraine. If there is a deal to be done between Washington and Moscow it will lie elsewhere, perhaps over Syria.This Munich conference will end on Sunday with many of the concerns of the Europeans only partially stilled. For they relate more to the character and outlook of the new US president himself. One of his tweets can undermine policies that have received bipartisan support in Washington for decades. And its not just a style thing: many of Mr Trump's policies remain unclear, even as so many positions inside his team remain unfilled."
2017-02-20,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20170220231941/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-39007019,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkFormer Prime Minister Tony Blair has launched a campaign to try to persuade the British people to change their minds about leaving the European Union. It comes just weeks before the government intends to trigger the departure mechanism. In a speech in London, he said that he respected the will of the people, but voters hadn't been given details about the terms on which Britain would exit the EU. Mr Blair argued that what he called the ""cost"" of Brexit was only now becoming clear. The referendum vote, he said, was based on ""imperfect knowledge"" which would now become ""informed knowledge"".It's true that we don't yet know the details of the UK's future relationship with the rest of the EU - that will depend on the deal that is negotiated - but lots was said during the referendum campaign about what Brexit would mean in more general terms. In particular, leading figures in both campaigns said leaving the EU would entail leaving the single market.Mr Blair suggested that immigration was the main issue that propelled Leave to victory in the referendum campaign. But, he argued, the effect of quitting would probably have only a modest impact on overall immigration levels.He pointed out that just over half of migration into the UK comes from outside the EU. That's confirmed by official statistics from the ONS. In the year to June 2016 net migration - the difference between the number of people who arrived and the number of people who left - was 196,000 from outside the EU, compared with 189,000 from inside the EU.The same is true for the gross migration statistics - ie just looking at how many citizens from different parts of the world arrived in the UK.Again, there were slightly more from outside the EU (289,000) than from inside (284,000) along with a smaller number of British citizens returning to live in the UK (77,000). And only an estimated 82,000 or 12.6% of the 650,000 total were EU citizens who arrived looking for work.Theresa May has ruled out introducing a points-based migration system but the government hasn't published details of what it does want to implement. If the new system continues to allow in EU migrants with job offers, as well as students and people coming to join spouses, then Mr Blair's 12% would be, broadly speaking, correct. There could be a bigger impact if the government opts for a capped number of work permits. But about half of total migration will be unaffected no matter what arrangements are made with the EU.This isn't really a fair quotation. It's a reference to an interview given by Philip Hammond on ITV's Peston on Sunday on 26 June.Mr Hammond said: ""I believe it's essential that we protect our access to the single European market. Whether we like it or not, our economy, over 40 years, has become shaped by that access, and to lose that access now would be catastrophic.""But note that he was talking about access to the single market. That's not the same as membership. You don't have to be a member of the single market to have access to it, although the level of access that Britain would have after leaving the single market would depend on what trade relationship was negotiated.It's true that the pound has fallen against the dollar and the euro since the referendum, although not by quite as much as Mr Blair said. It has recovered from its lowest point. Against the dollar, the pound is currently down about 16% compared with its pre-referendum level. Against the euro, it's about 10.5% down.It's also worth noting that the pound/euro exchange rate was at a similar level to now between 2009 and the middle of 2011, so it's hardly unprecedented. Against the dollar, though, the pound has hit multi-decade lows in recent months."
2017-02-20,'Block him out',https://web.archive.org//web/20170220231941/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38096514,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkIf Jenny ever gets married, there will be no dad walking her down the aisle and, if she gets her way, no mention of him on her marriage certificate either.This is because, according to the twenty-something professional, the man who sexually abused her for 18 months from the age of seven ""lost any right to be called my father"".Despite his horrific betrayal of the relationship between father and daughter, the current law gives the option for only his name and occupation to be recorded on her future marriage certificate - but not that of her mother ""who has been mum and dad all wrapped up in one"".This system, of recording only the names of the father of the bride and groom on the certificate, dates back to the early years of Queen Victoria's reign. While either party can ask for a line to be put through that box if they have never known their father or been brought up by a step-father, it's an inequality many people like Jenny feel should be addressed.It is also an issue that has provoked anger among MPs from all parties, who have spent several years attempting to bring about a change in the law to allow both parents to have their names and occupations recorded.Their campaign was given a boost when a petition on Change.org, calling for mothers' names to be added to marriage certificates, collected 70,600 signatures in January 2014. The petition said ""marriage should not be seen as a business transaction between the father of the bride and the father of the groom"".Former Prime Minister David Cameron said later that year that he would address this ""inequality in marriage"", adding that the exclusion of mothers' names from marriage registers in England and Wales did ""not reflect modern Britain"".Mr Cameron was gone from Downing Street before any action was taken and it now seems that Conservative MP Edward Argar's Registration of Marriage Bill is the most likely vehicle to overturn the law.A brief history of marriage:His bill, which would update the Marriage Act of 1949, would move the solely paper-based system to a central electronic register online, which would allow the mother's name to be included.It would also bring England and Wales into line with the rest of the UK. In Scotland and Northern Ireland, couples are asked to give the names of both parents on marriage documentation. The same applies for those entering a civil partnership.Similar attempts by Labour and Conservative MPs to change the law fell in 2015 after failing to get ministers' support. Labour frontbencher Christina Rees' private member's bill focused on the narrow point about putting the mother on the certificate. Former Conservative cabinet minister Dame Caroline Spelman's bill wanted marriages listed in a single electronic register instead of in marriage register books.Former home office minister Richard Harrington said at the time ""a combination"" of the two bills ""could deal with things quickly"".Unlike his predecessors', Mr Argar's bill - which is more like Dame Caroline's attempt - has succeeded in getting government backing because it will create a more secure system for keeping marriage records.""The whole point of this bill is the mothers and fathers of the bride and groom will be registered,"" said the Charnwood MP. ""In the great scheme of things it's a minor change, but it's symbolically very important for a large number of people who want a recognition of the role their mother played in their upbringing.""He added: ""It will also give victims of abuse, children of single mothers or errant fathers, the choice over whether to include their mother's names and not their father's.""You will see virtually no outward change in the form of the marriage ceremony, just in the manner that things are recorded. By moving to an online schedule system, we can easily amend the paper documentation - and it's more secure because it doesn't rely on the old parish register that is at risk of theft from the village church.""The church is supportive of the move, and over time it will save the taxpayer millions of pounds in administrative costs.""The bill is set to return to the Commons for its detailed committee stage after the half-term recess, and Mr Argar is hopeful it will receive Royal Assent - and so become law - by the summer.A spokesman for the Home Office said it wanted to see mothers' names recorded on marriage certificates ""as soon as possible"".Mum's done everythingFor Jenny, whose name has been changed to protect her identity, the law change cannot come soon enough. ""My dad's a rapist and he abused me and my sisters, so I never want any reference to him appearing on anything about my future,"" she said. ""He has no right to that - he lost that right many years ago.""I was only seven when the attacks started, and my siblings were much younger. It ended after I told my mother when I was eight and a half.""I've tried to block out what he did to me. ""I have a partner and I'm sure we will get married eventually, but I don't want my father involved in any way.  I'd only want my mum's name on the marriage certificate because as far as I'm concerned she's done everything for us."""

Sir Peter de la Mare, the Speaker or ""Prolocutor"" of the Good Parliament in April 1376 opened the first day with a long address on the shortcomings of the Crown - military failures, financial and moral corruption. Royal favourites were imprisoned. King Edward III's mistress, Alice Perrers, was condemned to ""seclusion"".  But by the autumn, royalty had fought back. The Parliament was dissolved and most of its work was undone. The King's mistress was back at Court.  The King's son, John of Gaunt, had Sir Peter de la Mare thrown in jail. And the new Speaker was John of Gaunt's own steward, the far more biddable Sir Thomas Huntingford.Until the 17th Century, the Speaker's loyalty was to the Crown rather than to MPs.  But they were often blamed if they delivered news the monarch didn't like.  It could be a dangerous job: seven Speakers were beheaded between 1394 and 1535.  That's why even today a new Speaker traditionally makes a show of being dragged reluctantly to the Chair.Staying on the right side of the Crown was especially tricky during the turmoil of the Wars of the Roses, when it was hard to be sure who would end up being the King.  One Speaker, John Wenlock, tried to hedge his bets by fighting on the side of both the Yorkists and the Lancastrians.   It didn't work out well. He was killed at the Battle of Tewkesbury, allegedly by his own commander who blamed Wenlock's general indecisiveness for the defeat. Gradually, the Speaker's role became one of representing Parliament, rather than the monarch. When Charles I came in person to the Commons on 4 January 1642 to arrest five MPs for treason, Speaker William Lenthall refused to reveal where they were. Hitherto seen as a rather timorous chap, this was his moment. He fell to his knees, but told the King: ""May it please your Majesty, I have neither eyes to see nor tongue to speak in this place but as the House is pleased to direct me, whose servant I am here.""  The King was humiliated and left without the men he'd come for.John Bercow is being criticised by some MPs today for - in their view - failing to be impartial on political issues. But the Speaker's impartiality is a relatively modern notion. In fact, some Speakers held other government offices at the same time.  They could take part in some debates and vote, when they weren't actually presiding over business. Arthur Onslow, who had the job for more than 30 years, began to change that. In fact, he used to boast of his impartiality - to the great irritation and disappointment of the Prime Minister, Sir Robert Walpole, who'd helped him to the job.It wasn't until the Victorian era that our current ideas of impartiality became the norm - though Irish Nationalists in the 1880s felt that Speaker Henry Brand stepped over the line in helping to put down their disruption in the Commons over Irish Home rule. In January 1881, they prolonged debate for 41 hours.  There were disorderly scenes. Irish MPs defied the Chair. And so, Speaker Brand helped the government to invent new procedures, still in use today, to cut the debate short on the Coercion Bill for Ireland.In spite of the controversies, it's almost unprecedented to sack a Speaker. Although in recent times, Michael Martin, was pressured into resigning, the only other one to be ousted forcibly was Sir John Trevor in 1695, who'd been found guilty of accepting a £1,000 bribe.  He also had the disadvantage of being so cross-eyed that MPs couldn't tell if he was giving them the nod to speak, or looking at someone else.And of course, for any MP who tries to oust a Speaker but fails, there's a big risk that in future debates, the Speaker seems strangely unable to see them at all, when they're hoping to be called."
2017-02-20,They said what?,https://web.archive.org//web/20170220231941/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38980742,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkIt was Abraham Lincoln's 208th birthday last weekend. The US Republican Party's social media feeds honoured the 16th president by sharing a picture of his iconic memorial in Washington DC, with an inspiring quote laid over the top. ""In the end, it's not the years in your life that counts, it's the life in your years,"" was the message on Twitter and Instagram, also shared by President Trump.There was just one problem: the words have been attributed to Lincoln many times over the years, but there is no evidence he ever said them. The post has since been deleted.It was the latest example of a growing modern phenomenon, the fake political quote.Some have said ""fake news"" could have swung the outcome of November's US presidential election. Bogus stories like ""Pope Francis Shocks World, Endorses Donald Trump for President"" were extensively shared online.Made up quotes are perhaps more benign than fictitious news stories with a clear political agenda. But they still raise concerns, says James Ball of Buzzfeed News, who is writing a book about ""post-truth"" politics.""If enough people share and believe these fake quotes, then they can contribute to the polarisation of politics, making each side think less of the other, especially as many partisans think fake news is a problem which affects primarily (or only) their opponents.""These fake quotes don't just come from right-wing politicians and activists. In the days after the US election, a quote supposedly taken from a 1998 Donald Trump interview went viral online. ""If I were to run, I'd run as a Republican. They're the dumbest group of voters in the country. They believe anything on Fox News. I could lie and they'd still eat it up,"" the quote said.It seemed too obnoxious to be true - and it was.Fake George Orwell quotes are a specialty in left-wing social media circles. One example is ""during times of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act."" There is no evidence the 1984 author ever said these words, but social media is awash with shareable pictures of them alongside Orwell's monochrome face.So how do bogus quotes like this get into circulation?""Sometimes people just want new followers or shares on social media, and either invent a quote or (naively or otherwise) lift a questionable one,"" says James Ball. ""Others invent quotes as a hoax or parody to show up people they disagree with, or to fire up their own side - or simply to make money from adverts on fake news sites.""The internet means fake quotes can spread very quickly. ""It's easier to fabricate things than it is to debunk them,"" says Rasmus Nielsen, director of research at the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at the University of Oxford. ""As communication gets easier, there is going to be more and more of this stuff floating about online.""Jenni Sargent runs First Draft News, which is working with social media companies and news organisations to look at innovative solutions to the problem.""People are experimenting with the most engaging way to spread false information,"" she says. She wants news websites to come up with entertaining ways of debunking fake facts and quotes.A blue tick next to a name on Twitter tells you the account has been verified as ""authentic"". Sargent wants to come up with ways to highlight unreliable sources, ""like the opposite of a blue tick"".Facebook is introducing tools for German users to flag false stories ahead of that country's parliamentary elections in the autumn. Third-party fact checkers would mark unreliable stories as ""disputed"".The BBC has also said it will fact check deliberately misleading stories ""masquerading as news"".   British MP Damian Collins is chairing a parliamentary inquiry into these issues, which will look at the possibility of news websites having ""verified"" markers. Collins thinks fake quotes attributed to electoral candidates could end up ""distorting the democratic process"".Often verifying quotes is simply a case of rigorously searching through publicly available information, says Kim LaCapria, who works for rumour-busting website Snopes. The volume of dubious content online is greater than ever before, but verification can be easier because far more information is digitised, she says. ""It's actually pretty easy for average social media users to fact check online.""Her job involves looking at outright fake quotes, but also real quotes presented in a misleading way. For example, Al Gore has been ridiculed for claiming he ""invented the internet"". The former vice president did once say ""I took the initiative in creating the Internet,"" but taken in full context, that line seems rather more modest.We are less likely to expend energy verifying a quote which confirms our political beliefs, says LaCapria, an effect which psychologists call confirmation bias.Whether a fake quote comes from the left or the right, it tends to have one common feature, she says. ""It validates our preconceived beliefs or feelings, and that's often proffered as a valid reason to spread it."""

The veteran Gaullist already has form.When he was Commissioner for the Internal Market and Financial Services, Mr Barnier was dubbed ""the most dangerous man in Europe"" after taking on the banking sector and championing a cap on bankers' bonuses. But while he alarmed some in the City, and will probably do so again, he also won grudging respect as a tough but even-handed negotiator.He will need all those skills and more in his new role - chief Brexit negotiator at the European Commission. And having moved seamlessly between big jobs in Paris and Brussels - French foreign minister, Commissioner, MEP - he looks well prepared. ""Don't ask me to tell you what will be at the end of the road, we haven't begun to walk yet,"" he told a conference in Brussels last month. Mr Barnier will stick closely to the official EU position of ""no negotiation without notification"" - waiting for the UK to trigger Article 50 to start the formal process of withdrawal. But he's clearly eager to get going.""I am waiting to begin,"" he said. ""I will be ready tomorrow to negotiate, frankly speaking.""And he will bring with him an instinctive pro-European agenda, and a deep knowledge of the workings of the single market.His deputy as chief Brexit negotiator is a German trade expert, Sabine Weyand, adding to the impression that Mr Barnier will lead a team that means business.One of the biggest challenges he (and his boss Jean-Claude Juncker) faces, is to ensure that representatives of the big member states don't sideline him in the Brexit divorce negotiations.But Mr Barnier's long career in French politics means he could well have the ear of the Elysee Palace, especially if - as looks likely - a centre-right candidate wins the French presidency next year. The stakes are so high that there are bound to be some clashes.Mr Barnier has sparred with the UK's Minister for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, before, when the men both served as Europe ministers in the 1990s. It is another reminder that Michel Barnier is a politician first and foremost, rather than a bureaucrat. There have certainly been criticisms - a dash of vanity, a lack of attention to detail. His career has had plenty of downs as well as ups.But he will defend his European vision to the end, and the British government would do well not to underestimate him.At the height of the eurozone crisis, Mr Barnier always refused (politely) to do broadcast interviews in English.""One wrong word,"" he told me once with a smile, ""and we could move markets.""The next few years will be equally challenging."

Scotland voted 62% in favour of Remain.The conversation online was being driven overwhelmingly by pro-independence campaigners. But people who had supported ""Better Together"" during the Scottish referendum vote also spoke about the possibility of a break-away from the UK as a result of the vote over EU membership.  Perhaps the most significant was Scottish author JK Rowling who tweeted: ""Scotland will seek independence now. Cameron's legacy will be breaking up two unions. Neither needed to happen.""Many took to Twitter to express new or strengthened pro-independence feelings in the wake of the latest vote (Just as a reminder: a ""Yes"" vote in Scotland's 2014 referendum was for independence, while the winning ""No"" campaign backed staying in the UK).One old tweet from 2014's independence referendum gained new life on Friday.

The amount will cover the UK's share of the cost of projects and programmes it signed up to as a member, as well as pensions for EU officials.In his speech, Mr Juncker, a former prime minister of Luxembourg, said: ""It will be a tough negotiation which will take two years to agree on the exit terms. And to agree on the future architecture of relations between the United Kingdom and the European Union we will need years. ""The British people have to know, they know already, that it will not be at a discount or at zero cost. The British must respect commitments they were involved in making. So the bill will be, to put it a bit crudely, very hefty.""Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task.It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.All you need to know about BrexitHe added:  ""We need to settle our affairs not with our hearts full of a feeling of hostility, but with the knowledge that the continent owes a lot to the UK. Without Churchill, we would not be here - we mustn't forget that, but we mustn't be naive.""Our British friends will need to understand that we want to continue to develop European integration.""Mrs May has already said the UK will leave the European single market, but has promised to push for the ""freest possible trade"" with European countries.In a speech in January outlining her priorities for Brexit, she warned the EU that to ""punish"" the UK for leaving would be ""an act of calamitous self-harm"".Earlier this month, the House of Commons overwhelmingly backed the EU Bill and the government has said the Lords must not ""frustrate"" its passage into law."

Urging peers to leave the bill unamended, Lord Lamont, who backed a Leave vote in June's referendum, said the views of the Remain side should be taken into account - and added: ""But equally I believe that those who voted to Remain have a duty not to undermine the government's negotiating position.""But Lord Darling told peers: ""I do not accept this argument that from now on those of us on the Remain side should sit back and say nothing and simply give the government a blank cheque to proceed.""He said this was impossible with so many ""unanswered questions"".Liberal Democrat Baroness Kramer said voters should have ""the final word"" on the Brexit deal in a referendum.MPs have already backed the proposed law, authorising Mrs May to inform the EU of the UK's intention to leave.Although there was no formal vote on Tuesday, opposition peers are seeking to amend the bill at a later date to guarantee the rights of EU citizens in Britain and the role of Parliament in scrutinising the process.As the government does not have a majority in the Lords, it is vulnerable to being outvoted if opposition peers - including Labour's 202 and the 102 Lib Dems - join forces. Much will hinge of the actions of the 178 crossbenchers - who are not aligned to any party.Mrs May has said she wants to invoke Article 50 of the 2009 Lisbon Treaty - the formal two-year mechanism by which a state must leave the EU - by the end of March, and the government has warned the House of Lords not to frustrate the process.Among other contributors to the debate, former Labour foreign secretary Lord Owen, who sits as an Independent Social Democrat, said: ""You cannot face this issue and ignore the decision of the referendum.""But equally well, you cannot talk about a United Kingdom without being aware of the fact that a substantial number of people did not vote for it. We have to take account of those divisions as we approach this next and most crucial stage.""And former ambassador to the EU Lord Kerr of Kinlochard, who drew up the Article 50 procedure, said it was not irrevocable and Parliament could invite the government or the country to think again.The UK would remain a full member of the EU throughout the negotiating period and, ""if having looked into the abyss we were to change our minds about withdrawal, we certainly could and no-one in Brussels could stop us"", he added.Winding up the debate, Brexit minister Lord Bridges said the bill should be passed as quickly as possible to allow negotiations with the rest of the EU to start.A clear majority had voted to leave the EU and there could be ""no attempts to remain inside and no attempts to rejoin"", he told peers. He also suggested giving unilateral guarantees over the future of EU nationals living in the UK would not help British expats based in other member states.""They could end up facing two years of uncertainty if any urgency of resolving their status was removed by the UK making a one-sided guarantee,"" he said.Detailed scrutiny of the bill at committee stage is due to take place on 27 February and 1 March. If the bill is not amended, then it could theoretically be approved by the Lords at Third Reading on 7 March, becoming law shortly afterwards.If peers do make changes to the bill, it would put them on a collision course with MPs - who overwhelmingly passed the bill unaltered and would be expected to overturn any Lords amendments."

HSBC said last month that it was preparing to move 1,000 jobs to Paris.Speaking after talks with Mrs May, Mr Macron was keen to emphasise his enthusiasm for such developments, telling reporters: ""I was very happy to see that some academics and researchers in the UK, because of the Brexit, would consider to come to France precisely to work.""Asked if he wanted banks to move to Paris after Brexit, he said: ""I want banks, talents, researchers, academics and so on. ""I think that France and the EU are a very attractive space.""Mr Macron, who appeared alone in Downing Street after his meeting, said there was a ""series of initiatives"" aimed at getting ""talented people… working here to come to France"".The former economy minister and investment banker added that despite the UK leaving the EU, there should be ""further co-operation in terms of defence"" between it and France.On the future of French nationals in the UK, Mr Macron said: ""I will be very careful about the way for our people to be allowed to stay here and work in good conditions.""Last week, Mrs May stressed the importance of an early deal to establish the rights of EU citizens living in the UK and UK citizens living in other EU countries.Mr Macron has largely been in third place in recent French presidential opinion polls, behind the National Front's Marine Le Pen and Republican Francois Fillon. In some, he has come second. Further polling suggests that, if he came second overall to Ms Le Pen in the first round of voting and entered a final run-off against her, he would win the presidency.After speaking to the media, Mr Macron walked around Westminster, stopping to chat and appear in selfies.A Downing Street spokesman said Mrs May and Mr Macron had had ""a private conversation"".Asked whether the French politician had been invited, he said: ""He is in London, and we have been able to accommodate him."""

A House of Lords spokesman said: ""The House of Lords is an active and effective revising chamber that considered 3,678 amendments to legislation in the last session, and members contribute to that work in a wide variety of ways.""He said that in the 2015-16 Parliamentary session, 710 members spoke in debates, 779 voted and 321 were members of select committees.Members can be suspended where they are found to have claimed an allowance without carrying parliamentary work, he added."
2017-02-21,UK finances on track for Budget boost,https://web.archive.org//web/20170222022200/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-39037698,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkGovernment finances recorded a £9.4bn in surplus in January, £0.3bn higher than the same month last year.Boosted by self-assessment tax receipts, January is typically a strong month for government finances.For the financial year-to-date, borrowing stands at £49.3bn, the lowest since the comparable period of 2008.Economists say strong tax receipts mean the government could undershoot the forecast deficit of £68bn for the current financial year.The forecast was made by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) in November's Autumn Statement, although this estimate marked a sharp revision from the previous prediction of £55.5bn.Kamal Ahmed: Chancellor Hammond’s £10bn of green shootsPhilip Hammond presents his Budget on 8 March, and the chancellor will base his budget calculations on updated figures on growth and borrowing supplied by the OBR.In a statement, a Treasury spokesperson said: ""We remain committed to returning the public finances to balance and building on our progress in reducing the deficit from 10% to 4% of GDP over the last six years.""Earlier this month, the EY Item Club economic think tank said that estimated borrowing for the 2016-17 financial year could be revised down to £65bn from the £68bn forecast made in the Autumn Statement.""The OBR is likely to deliver some rare good news to the chancellor by revising down its forecast for public sector net borrowing in the current fiscal year,"" the EY Item Club said in its Budget preview.""Unusually, tax revenues have been performing better than expected in recent months,"" it said.Other forecasters are even more optimistic about the outlook for UK finances.John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, thinks that borrowing for the financial year could be less than £60bn. As a result, the chancellor might have some room for extra spending in the Budget.""Overall, the public finances now look in rather better shape than they did three months ago, and more in line with other data showing a relatively robust UK economy in the period since the Brexit vote.""This should give the chancellor a bit more room in his Budget on 8th March to find extra money for priorities like the NHS and social care, and possibly also to alleviate the increase in business rates for the biggest losers from the coming revaluation in April.""Philip Hammond is not a man known for political surprises.Spreadsheet Phil, as he probably doesn't like to be called, prefers to keep any rabbits that might be hopping around Whitehall stuffed deep in the Treasury's public spending hat.So, anyone thinking that today's better news on the state of government's finances will lead to any Budget largesse is likely to be disappointed.Those close to him are making clear, there may be some minor tweaks but there will not be major changes of direction on Budget day on 8 March.Brexit is still, in the Treasury's mind, a risk to the economy that looms large and any buffers built up now are likely to be kept back for future rainy days - if they come - rather than be spent now.More from Kamal here."
2017-02-21,What future for E numbers after Brexit?,https://web.archive.org//web/20170222022200/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-39028071,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThinking about E numbers might stir up images of hyperactive children guzzling fluorescent soft drinks. But have you ever wondered what the E stands for?Looking at this system of food additives can help illustrate some of the tough issues facing the British government as it prepares to leave the European Union.The European Council introduced food colouring legislation in 1962 alongside a number classification system. In the 1990s the scheme was expanded to cover all additives permitted to be used in food sold in the EU and now forms a key part of UK food and drink regulation.The government wants to begin formal Brexit negotiations by the end of March, after which UK laws will be made ""not in Brussels but in Westminster"", according to Prime Minister Theresa May.So will the UK ditch E numbers and come up with a new system for assessing and labelling food additives? And what about the many other areas of UK regulation currently set by EU law?For a substance to be permitted for use as a food additive in the EU, it must be given an E number (the E stands for Europe). Codes like E101, E150d and E1209 are assigned to substances which change food colour, taste, shelf life or other properties.For example E160b, or annatto, gives Red Leicester cheese its distinctive glow.E numbers are often associated with processed food. Some, like E122, may have adverse effects on children prone to hyperactivity according to the NHS.But most are perfectly benign and lots are good for us, like E300, otherwise known as Vitamin C.At the moment if a food company comes up with a new additive, it must seek authorisation from an expert panel at the European Food Safety Authority. This EU body is made up of scientists from across the continent, including two from the UK.They are experts in chemistry, toxicology and other relevant fields and meet regularly to assess which additives are safe. Once agreed, these substances must be clearly labelled on food sold in the UK or elsewhere in the EU. As part of the Brexit process, the government has announced it will introduce a ""Great Repeal Bill"" in the next Queen's Speech.This will remove the European Communities Act 1972 from the statute book and enshrine all existing EU law into British law, before the government decides which to keep and which to jettison. This is likely to include EU regulations on food additives and labelling.However such an approach opens up a number of other questions.For example, what would happen when the EU changes its list of E numbers - will the UK adopt or ignore the new rules? If it adopts them, how does this square with the government's wish that laws be made in Westminster and if it ignores E number changes, will domestic food companies be able to trade freely with European suppliers?The government says it will push for the ""freest possible trade"" with the EU after Brexit. But if the UK decided to keep E numbers while not being under the jurisdiction of European courts, there would need to be a new system whereby the EU's remaining 27 states could verify that UK goods observe the rules, says Stephen Weatherill, professor of European law at Oxford University. ""It is beyond complicated - and this is true of thousands and thousands of such matters,"" says Prof Weatherill.But not everyone agrees.""Some of the academics are making it more complicated than they need to,"" says Conservative MP Bill Cash, who chairs the House of Commons European Scrutiny Committee and is a long-standing supporter of Brexit. He says the UK may choose to adopt standards like E numbers, but on the basis of voluntary compliance rather than by submitting to the EU's legal jurisdiction, enforced by the European Court of Justice.There are many other unresolved questions when it comes to E numbers.How will standards set by the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation be incorporated, will the UK set up its own expert panel and will E numbers be renamed - ""UK numbers"" perhaps? Nobody is quite sure of the answers yet.These uncertainties hang over many areas of UK law which currently come from the EU, like farm subsidies, clean energy targets and fishing rules.But if non-EU Switzerland is a model, we may simply retain many existing structures. Switzerland uses E numbers and belongs to lots of similar schemes like the European Health Insurance Card.""There may not be as much change as people are trying to suggest there would be,"" says Mr Cash.The Brexit negotiations will involve plenty of big constitutional issues, but there are many apparently smaller things, like E numbers, which will need to be sorted out as well."

As far as I know I've never spoken like that and no friends of mine have ever spoken like that - I completely deplore it and find it ridiculous to speak like that in private.""All I'm saying is most of us would be rather embarrassed if everything that we said in private in our past (was broadcast).""Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan responded to the debate for the government, saying: ""We believe it is absolutely right that we should use all the tools at our disposal to build common ground with President Trump.""The visit should happen. The visit will happen. And when it does, I trust the United Kingdom will extend a polite and generous welcome to President Donald Trump.""Outside, a group of anti-Trump protesters gathered in Parliament Square.Similar demonstrations were organised elsewhere around the UK, including in Edinburgh, Manchester, Liverpool, Cardiff and Newcastle.Prime Minister Theresa May announced the state visit during a visit to Washington for talks with Mr Trump.It led to petitions titled Prevent Donald Trump from making a State Visit to the United Kingdom and Donald Trump should make a State Visit to the United Kingdom.Commons Speaker John Bercow was criticised by some MPs after he said Mr Trump should not address Parliament during the trip in light of the row over his travel ban and comments about women.Mr Trump was invited to the UK for a state visit after just seven days as president, while it took 758 days for Barack Obama and 978 days for George W Bush.The government has said it recognised the ""strong views"" expressed by the US president but looked forward to welcoming him once details have been arranged."

""Nor can it estimate the wider effects of sanctions on people and their overall cost, or benefit, to government.""The committee called for the DWP to trial issuing warnings for first offences and for variations in sanction referrals to be monitored.Labour MP Meg Hillier, who chairs the committee, said: ""Benefit sanctions have been used as a blunt instrument by government.""It is an article of faith for the Department for Work and Pensions that sanctions encourage people into work. ""The reality is far more complex and the potential consequences severe.""She added: ""Some people who receive sanctions stop claiming without finding work, adding to pressures on other services.""Suspending people's benefit payments can lead them into debt, rent arrears and homelessness, which can undermine their efforts to find work.""A DWP spokesman said: ""Our sanctions guidance is the same right across the UK, and the fact is the number of sanctions has more than halved in recent years.""Sanctions are an important part of our benefits system, and are only used in a very small percentage of cases as a last resort when people don't fulfil their commitment to find work.""The DWP added: ""We keep our policies under constant review to ensure that they continue to function effectively and fairly, and where we identify an issue, we act quickly to put it right."""

The report from the cross-party committee, though, says recruitment targets for teaching had been consistently missed and the teacher shortage is getting worse.It warns that this causes particular problems in some shortage subjects in secondary school, including physics, maths and computing.But the MPs say that there is no clear long-term plan to address this - and they suggest there should be greater efforts to keep teachers from leaving the profession and moving to other jobs.Figures last year showed that almost a third of new teachers who had started jobs in English state schools in 2010 had left within five years.The MPs want measures to tackle problems that make people leave teaching - such as an ""unmanageable workload"" or a lack of professional development.""The government needs to do more to encourage teachers to stay in the profession by raising the status of teachers, improving the opportunities for good quality training, and by doing all it can to help reduce teacher workload,"" said Neil Carmichael, who chairs the committee.He said the government could consider ""holding fire"" on policy changes that added to the pressure on schools.And he suggested schools needed time to support staff development without constantly being ""distracted by the demands of the latest Whitehall directive"".Malcolm Trobe, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union said: ""The crisis in teacher supply has a direct impact on the education that schools are able to provide to their pupils. ""It means that important subjects like maths and science have to be covered by teachers who are not specialists in these subjects and that schools have to increasingly rely on supply staff.""Dame Alison Peacock, chief executive of the Chartered College of Teaching said: ""As well as bringing new talent into our profession, we must stretch every sinew to hang on to that talent and develop it further.""Ministers have argued that they have kept teaching as an attractive profession in a competitive jobs market.There have been a series of high-profile advertising campaigns for teaching and there are financial incentives focused on attracting recruits into shortage subjects.Labour's shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, said the government was ""failing to deliver on its most basic of tasks"".""Recruitment targets are being missed, school budgets are being cut for the first time in decades and we have thousands more unqualified teachers teaching in our schools."" Liberal Democrat education spokesman John Pugh said the lack of pay rises for teachers had added to a sense that they were ""undervalued"".""It's high time the cap on public sector wages was lifted so teachers were given the pay rise they deserve,"" he said.A Department for Education spokesman said: ""There are more teachers in England's schools than ever before, with secondary postgraduate recruitment at its highest since 2011. ""We are investing more than £1.3bn in recruitment over this Parliament and have recruited more trainees in key subjects like physics and maths than last year."""
2017-02-21,MPs attack inaction over gender pay gap,https://web.archive.org//web/20170222022200/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-39026022,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkMPs on a select committee have attacked the government for failing to implement reforms aimed at eliminating the gender pay gap.The Women and Equalities Committee said the government had failed to act on its recommendations on tackling the structural causes of wage inequality.The government's response was ""inadequate"" and ""deeply disappointing"", the MPs said. The government said ""we are committed to tackling the gender pay gap.""The Women and Equalities Committee published its report and 17 recommendations on tackling the pay gap in March last year.It received the government's response in January, but is only now publishing the details of that response, which it described as ""inadequate"". The committee has highlighted three areas where it wants the government to justify rejecting its recommendations.  For example, the MPs said all jobs should be available to work flexibly unless an employer can demonstrate a business case against doing so.In response, the government said the right to request flexible working - which is already in place - ""strikes a balance between giving employees the flexibility to combine work with other responsibilities and allowing employers to plan effectively"".The committee also wanted a ""more effective policy on shared parental leave"", with fathers getting three months well-paid paternal leave.The government rejected that proposal, arguing that shared parental leave was ""still a very new policy"". It also pointed out the additional cost of well-paid paternity leave. The committee also recommended a ""National Pathways into Work"" scheme to help women over the age of 40 back into the labour market.The government said it already provided ""advice and support to help women over 40 through the National Careers Service"" as well as a range of other assistance, including loans, a career review and training programmes.   Committee chair Maria Miller said: ""Without effectively tackling the key issues of flexible working, sharing unpaid caring responsibilities, and supporting women aged over 40 back into the workforce, the gender pay gap will not be eliminated. ""We made practical, evidence-based recommendations to address these issues. They were widely supported by a range of stakeholders including businesses, academics, and unions. ""It is deeply disappointing that our recommendations have not been taken on board by Government,"" she added.A Government spokesperson said: ""We are committed to tackling the gender pay gap and our policies, which aim to balance the needs of employees and businesses while addressing this gap, are working.""""We now have the lowest gender pay gap on record, around 60,000 people a year are taking advantage of flexible working arrangements and the introduction of Shared Parental Leave gives parents extra flexibility and we will continue to evaluate this as it beds in. We're also supporting women over 40 in the workplace through the National Careers Service. ""But we know there's more to do. That's why we are requiring employers to publish their gender pay and gender bonus gap for the first time from April and we are giving working parents of three and four year olds up to 30 hours of free childcare from September."""

""That's where he was unprofessional, but he's apologised, it's been taken down.In a statement, Mr Monkham said: ""Although the timing of our resignations is unfortunate in light of upcoming elections, both Adam and I wish to make it clear, where the painful subject of Hillsborough is concerned, with closure not yet in sight, this unprofessional approach and crass insensitivity from high profile people closely within and without UKIP is upsetting and intolerable.""He said they had been ""affected both personally and professionally by words that were not said in our name"". ""With this in mind, we wish to apologise to the people of Liverpool and the Hillsborough families for any offence caused and have done what we consider to be the only honourable thing we could do which was to resign and disassociate ourselves from UKIP.""Mr Monkham added that he ""felt that supporting a libertarian party was the right thing to do in order to effect change within the political system in this country"". ""Unfortunately that dream has been shattered and the potential of UKIP has been squandered by people who have demonstrated they are not fit to lead at present.""The BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith said UKIP officials in Merseyside were expecting further resignations in protest at Mr Nuttall's handling of the Hillsborough controversy.Mr Nuttall, who is an MEP for North West England, is a candidate in the Stoke Central by-election, which is being held on Thursday.

2017-02-21,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20170222022200/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThis article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide to the UK's vote to leave the European Union. It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 52% to 48%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who resigned on the day after losing the referendum. Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she says she will respect the will of the people. She has said ""Brexit means Brexit"" but there is still a lot of debate about what that will mean in practice especially on the two key issues of how British firms do business in the European Union and what curbs are brought in on the rights of European Union nationals to live and work in the UK. She set out more details of her negotiating hopes in her key speech on Brexit.The UK economy appears to have weathered the initial shock of the Brexit vote, although the value of the pound remains near a 30-year low, but opinion is sharply divided over the long-term effects of leaving the EU. Some major firms such as Easyjet and John Lewis have pointed out that the slump in sterling has increased their costs. Britain also lost its top AAA credit rating, meaning the cost of government borrowing will be higher. But share prices have recovered from a dramatic slump in value, with both the FTSE 100 and the broader FTSE 250 index, which includes more British-based businesses, trading higher than before the referendum. The Bank of England cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - a record low and the first cut since 2009 - after the vote and there has not been the economic slump or recession that some had predicted. The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it has to invoke an agreement called Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May has said she intends to trigger this process by the end of March 2017, meaning the UK will be expected to have left by the summer of 2019, depending on the precise timetable agreed during the negotiations. The government will also enact a Great Repeal Bill which will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. It is expected to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove.After a court battle, the UK's Supreme Court ruled in January that Parliament must be consulted before Article 50 is invoked. This is why a two line Brexit bill is currently making its way through Parliament. MPs have approved it after Labour MPs were told to support it. It has got through its first House of Lords debate with debate and votes on possible changes expected in the next week.Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These men - dubbed the Three Brexiteers - will play a central role in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although it will be Mrs May, as prime minister, who will have the final say. David Cameron's government did not do any emergency planning for Brexit ahead of the referendum and Mrs May has rejected calls to say what her negotiating goals are.Once Article 50 has been triggered, the UK will have two years to negotiate its withdrawal. But no one really knows how the Brexit process will work - Article 50 was only created in late 2009 and it has never been used. Former Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, now Chancellor, wanted Britain to remain in the EU, and he has suggested it could take up to six years for the UK to complete exit negotiations. The terms of Britain's exit will have to be agreed by 27 national parliaments, a process which could take some years, he has argued. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. The UK will continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making.Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Following Theresa May's Brexit recent speech we now know that the UK is not intending to stay in the EU's single market. Although there has been speculation for months about the issue, it would have meant the UK staying under the auspices of the European Court of Justice and having to allow unlimited EU immigration, under freedom of movement rules.Both sides want trade to continue after Brexit with the UK seeking a positive outcome for those who wish to trade goods and services"" - such as those in the City of London and wanting a ""comprehensive free trade deal"" giving the UK ""the greatest possible access"" to the single market. Mrs May says she wants the UK to reach a new customs union deal with the EU. A customs union is where countries agree not to impose tariffs on each others' goods and have a common tariff on goods coming in from elsewhere. The UK is currently part of the EU customs union but that stops the UK being able to do its own trade deals with other countries. Reality Check: How could customs union work?These terms have increasingly been used as debate focused on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people in order to maintain access to the EU single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result.The government has declined to give a firm guarantee about the status of EU nationals currently living in the UK, saying this is not possible without a reciprocal pledge from other EU members about the millions of British nationals living on the continent. EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, will be be able to stay, the chief civil servant at the Home Office has said. The rights of other EU nationals would be subject to negotiations on Brexit and the ""will of Parliament"", he added.A lot depends on the kind of deal the UK agrees with the EU. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions on EU nationals, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.Again, it depends on whether the UK government decides to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages. Citizens' Advice has reminded people their rights have not changed yet and asked anyone to contact them if they think they have been discriminated against following the Leave vote.Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested EU migrants who come to the UK as Brexit nears may not be given the right to stay. He has said there might have to be a cut-off point if there was a ""surge"" in new arrivals.People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote. The day-to-day spending impact is likely to be more significant. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it to remain at least 10% below where it was on 23 June, in the long term. This means imported goods will consequently get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have already been seen and the issue was most notably illustrated by the dispute between Tesco and Marmite's makers about whether prices would be put up or not in the stores.The latest UK inflation figures, for January, showed the CPI inflation rate rising to 1.8%, its highest level for two and a half years, with signs of more cost pressures set to feed through in the months to come.Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration.She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations. As mentioned above, the key issue is whether other EU nations will grant the UK access to the single market, if that is what it wants, while at the same time being allowed to restrict the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK.Mrs May has said she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. It is currently running at 330,000 a year, of which 184,000 are EU citizens, and 188,000 are from outside the EU - the figures include a 39,000 outflow of UK citizens.It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Liberal Democrats - who have just a handful of MPs - have vowed to halt Brexit and keep Britain in the EU if they were to win the next general election.Some commentators, including former House of Commons clerk Lord Lisvane, have argued that a further referendum would be needed to ratify whatever deal the UK hammers out with the EU, but there are few signs political leaders view this as a viable option.Yes. Theresa May has appeared keen to avoid a vote on her negotiating stance, to avoid having to give away her priorities, but Theresa May has said there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. It is worth mentioning that any deal also has to be agreed by the European Parliament - with British MEPs getting a chance to vote on it there.  While there could be limitations on British nationals' ability to live and work in EU countries, it seems unlikely they would want to deter tourists. There are many countries outside the European Economic Area, which includes the 28 EU nations plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway, that British citizens can visit for up to 90 days without needing a visa and it is possible that such arrangements could be negotiated with European countries.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. In theory, the government could, if it wanted, decide to change the colour, which is currently standardised for EU countries, says the BBC's Europe correspondent, Chris Morris.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketNo nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it is ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faces being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. A second independence referendum for the country is now ""highly likely"", she has said, although not in 2017. She has said she wants Scotland to stay in the single market and said Mrs May's decision to rule out the UK staying in the single market ""undoubtedly"" brings the referendum closer.Before his resignation Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said the impact in Northern Ireland would be ""very profound"" and that the whole island of Ireland should now be able to vote on reunification. But, speaking while she was still Northern Ireland Secretary, Theresa Villiers ruled out the call from Sinn Féin for a border poll, saying the circumstances in which one would be called did not exist. The land border is likely to be a key part of the Brexit talks. Theresa May said a priority for her would be negotiating a deal with the EU which allowed a common travel area between the UK and the Republic of Ireland.During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest. But his successor Theresa May has said she will keep it in place, at least for the current Parliament, which is due to last until 2020.So far there has been a cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. There are yet to be signs that rising inflation have worried the Bank of England  enough to consider raising interest rates.  But if that happened it would make mortgages and loans more expensive to repay - but would be good news for savers.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.Eurotunnel boss Jacques Gounon said last November the reintroduction of duty-free would be ""an incredible boost for my business"" but he later said  that remark had been ""light-hearted"". Erik Juul-Mortensen, president of the Tax Free World Association (TFWA) said after the referendum vote ""it is not possible to predict how Brexit will affect the duty free and travel retail industry, and it is wiser not to make assumptions about exactly what the impact will be.""  They are at the moment but no-one knows the longer term prospects for definite. The EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - is not an EU initiative. It was negotiated between countries within a group known as the European Economic Area, often simply referred to as the single market (plus Switzerland, which confusingly is not a member of the EEA, but has agreed access to the single market). Therefore, the future of Britons' EHIC cover could depend on whether the UK decided to sever ties with the EEA.Probably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report. In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two-thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.However, the UK government is committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, the UK government is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR. However, the EU has its own European Court of Justice, whose decisions are binding on EU institutions and member states.Its rulings have sometimes caused controversy in Britain and supporters of a Brexit have called for immediate legislation to curb its powers. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also cited sovereignty and democracy, and they wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Four of the biggest US banks have committed to helping maintain the City's position. But HSBC will move up to 1,000 jobs to Paris, the BBC understands. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Pest control firm Rentokil Initial says it could make £15m extra this year thanks to a weaker currency.Others are less optimistic. Hilary Jones, a director at UK cosmetics firm Lush said the company was ""terrified"" about the economic impact. She added that while the firm's Dorset factory would continue to produce goods for the UK market, products for the European market may be made at its new plant in Germany.Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After the Leave vote, the government will probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""As with most elements of the UK economy, not enough solid data has been published yet to accurately conclude the Brexit effect on house prices. Industry figures have pointed to ""uncertainty"" among buyers and sellers that could potentially change the housing market.So far, the most significant research has come from the respected Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which has published the conclusions of a survey of its members. This primarily records sentiment among surveyors.It found that house prices are expected to fall across the UK in the three months after the referendum vote. However, the dip in prices is only expected to persist over the 12 months from June in London and East Anglia, surveyors predict.House prices were already slowing in central London, owing to the fall-out from changes to stamp duty rules in April.Separate figures from property portal Rightmove suggested the average asking price of houses coming on to the market in England and Wales fell by 0.9%, or £2,647, in July compared with June. It said that agents had reported very few sales had fallen through as a result of the vote.Many potential first-time buyers would welcome a fall in house prices, with ownership among the young falling owing to affordability concerns. Investors in property, or those who have paid off a mortgage and hope to leave homes as inheritance would be unhappy with a long-term reduction in value.  Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law following the decision to leave the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" will not necessarily disappear overnight - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU means the UK will not be part of TTIP. It will have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Former Labour health secretary Lord Owen has said that because of TTIP (see answer above) the only way to protect the NHS from further privatisation was to get out of the EU."

Mr Snell is a member and former leader of Newcastle-under-Lyme Council, who campaigned for a Remain vote in the EU referendum.UKIP, which narrowly beat the Conservatives into second place in the 2015 general election, is fielding its leader, Paul Nuttall, as its candidate. The MEP was born in Bootle, where he has stood in the last three general elections.The Tories have chosen 25-year-old city councillor Jack Brereton. He is the deputy leader of the Conservative Group in the council's ruling coalition, where he is also the Cabinet member for Regeneration, Transport and Heritage. The Green Party has picked Adam Colclough as their candidate, with Zulfiqar Ali standing for the Liberal Democrats.See below for a full list of candidates.The successful Liberal Democrat by-election campaign in Richmond Park in December was seen as a result of the party making Brexit a key issue in what was a very Remain constituency.The wider Stoke area (which includes Stoke Central) voted strongly to Leave in June's referendum so the question is how much of an impact Brexit is likely to have. Since being created for the 1950 general election, Stoke Central has always returned Labour MPs.It has traditionally been seen as rock solid Labour territory and Mr Hunt won in 2015 by a 5,179 margin.Labour's majority has been decreasing sharply in recent years, from 49.5% in 1997 to 16.7% in 2015.Stoke-on-Trent Central covers the administrative centre of the six Potteries towns: Burslem, Fenton, Hanley, Longton, Stoke-upon-Trent and Tunstall.As BBC Midlands political editor Patrick Burns notes, this may be the last time the seat is contested.""For all its rich history and industrial heritage, it's set to be scrapped under proposed Parliamentary boundary changes which would reduce Stoke's present three seats to two,"" he says.""And with (Labour MPs) Ruth Smeeth and Rob Flello apparently in no mood to relinquish their neighbouring seats, it's no wonder that this is being unofficially dubbed as a job for three years.""Mr Nuttall has admitted a previous claim that he lost ""close personal friends"" in the Hillsborough disaster was wrong.The UKIP candidate apologised and said the quotes on his website from 2011 were ""wrong"" and had been taken down.There was also a clash with Labour over whether Mr Nuttall was actually living in the Stoke house registered as his address on nomination papers. UKIP later said he had to leave the house for safety reasons after the address was circulated on social media.Mr Snell, meanwhile, has apologised after some of his old tweets about people appearing on TV shows have re-emerged, including a description of panellists on ITV's Loose Women as ""squabbling sour-faced ladies"" and remarks about Janet Street-Porter and a woman on the BBC's The Apprentice.The Labour candidate also previously posted disparaging remarks about his party's current leader Jeremy Corbyn and Brexit.Here is a list of the candidates, in alphabetical order by surname:Polls open at 07:00 GMT on 23 February and close at 22:00 GMT."

The councillor and former doctor and ambulance driver was chosen from an all-woman shortlist.Up against her for the Conservatives is Trudy Harrison, who lives in the village of Bootle and was a parish councillor for a number of years.UKIP has chosen its 2015 general election candidate, Fiona Mills.The Liberal Democrats have chosen Rebecca Hanson and the Green Party Jack Lenox as their candidates. There are also two independent candidates - Michael Guest and Roy Ivinson.Copeland and its predecessor Whitehaven have been Labour since 1935, but the seat has become more marginal in recent years.Mr Reed, who had been an MP since 2005, held the seat by 2,564 votes from the Conservatives in 2015, with UKIP another 8,038 votes behind in third.The Tories are bidding to become the first governing party to make a by-election gain - not including a 1982 poll triggered by a defecting Labour MP - since 1960.With nearly 11,000 people employed at Sellafield, thousands more in the supply chain and a new power plant proposed in the constituency, the nuclear industry has been a key issue.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's previous opposition to new nuclear power stations has been highlighted by his opponents, although the Labour leader has since given his backing for the £10bn Moorside plant, due to open in 2024.Doubts were raised over the project after Toshiba, which has a 60% share in NuGen, the firm behind the scheme, sustained heavy losses.During a visit to the constituency, Prime Minister Theresa May was asked about union calls for the government to guarantee the investment to ensure the project goes ahead, saying her party ""recognises the importance"" of the nuclear industry.The prime minister also faced questions about the future of Whitehaven's West Cumberland Hospital, with Labour campaigning hard on the future of the maternity unit amid concerns consultant-led services could be moved elsewhere.A key link road, the A595, has also been inspected by both Transport Secretary, Chris Grayling and his Labour counterpart, Andy McDonald, with campaigners calling for urgent improvements to be made.Polls will be open from 07:00 GMT on 23 February until 22:00 BST, with the result expected overnight."

The government's figures are for the situation after any appeals have been completed, so they depend on how accurately it has predicted their outcome.The government has produced tables showing how much business rates would rise or fall in the coming year, broken down by region of the country and type of business.The overall effect of all the changes comes to zero, which means that the policy is revenue neutral. But there is a key caveat at the bottom of the table, which is that the figures are: ""Before inflation and the adjustment to the multiplier for future appeal outcomes.""The inflation part is widely known. The measure of inflation used will become CPI (Consumer Price Index) instead of RPI (Retail Price Index), which will usually mean the increase is smaller, but that change will not happen until 2020. Increasing rates for RPI will add about 2% per year.But the other part is a bit more complicated - it is the adjustment required to make sure that the changes in rates are revenue neutral even after some businesses have appealed against the rated value of their premises and won. Analysis from the property consultants Gerald Eve suggested that the adjustment would be between four and five percentage points. They did that by working out how much business rates would change across the country to find out what adjustment would then be needed to make the policy revenue neutral again.They add that including both the inflation and the appeals adjustment means that business rates will fall in 135 of the 326 local authorities in England, not 259 as the government claimed. The Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) has strongly disputed suggestions that it has misled people with its figures, but has not disputed the suggestion that the appeals adjustment is between four and five percentage points.Speaking on the Today Programme, Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen said he thought the figures provided, ""might not be giving the picture that businesses in the real world are going to get when they get their bills"".This is certainly true. The DCLG has been clear that its figures are before inflation and the appeals adjustment.The government's figures are for the situation after any appeals have been completed, so they depend on how accurately it has predicted their outcome.Read more from Reality Check"
2017-02-21,Twitter mystery,https://web.archive.org//web/20170222022200/http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-39041596,"Why is a strange network of Twitter accounts, usually the source of pro-Russian messages, now pumping out tweets about a very specific British election? They number in the dozens and they are targeting the pro-Brexit UK Independence Party and in particular its leader, Paul Nuttall.This odd collection of Twitter accounts is obsessive. They co-ordinate their messages. And they are also praising Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn ahead of Thursday's by-election in Stoke-on-Trent Central. There's no evidence that they are connected to Labour or any other political party, however.Nuttall, who was elected UKIP leader in November, is contesting the seat, which has traditionally been solid for Labour. The Twitter network appears to be attempting to try to swing voters by coordinating its messages, firing out memes which play up anti-UKIP news in quick succession: There is of course nothing unusual about political messaging on Twitter - and these accounts don't have big  numbers of followers or retweets - but the strange shift from pro-Russian to anti-UKIP messaging has caught people's attention. The network was initially uncovered by Alex King, an independent researcher who tweets as @GlasnostGone. King tracks Russian propaganda on social media and was an organiser of the campaign to free a Ukrainian fighter pilot, Nadiya Savchenko, who was captured by pro-Russian forces battling in Ukraine in 2014. Full analysis of the Stoke-on-Trent Central race from BBC PoliticsTrump's tweet lead was 'swelled by bots'Visit the Trending Facebook pageKing noticed patterns that suggest the accounts are part of a co-ordinated campaign rather than driven by individual users. For instance, the accounts in question use stock pictures as profile images. In addition to the memes they litter their tweets with hashtags, apparently to try to influence the conversation around specific topics. Bots - automated Twitter accounts - pushing political messages tend to use more hashtags and push repetitive messages. King initially found the accounts were putting out pro-Russia and anti-Ukraine memes, and identified them in a YouTube video. For example:Several of the accounts put out such messages almost exclusively until early February, when they started to include the anti-UKIP and pro-Labour tweets. It's difficult to tell who is behind the accounts or whether they are controlled by one person or several. BBC Trending sent messages to the accounts involved. None responded.

But it also affords an opportunity for a whole series of behind the scenes bilateral meetings. And once every four years it is the place where Europe takes stock of a new US administration.This year the meeting had added significance since the man in the White House, Donald Trump, is unlike any other president in living memory. His supporters believe he is the man to overturn the ""establishment"" in Washington and to get things done. His detractors believe he is unfit for high office, his erratic behaviour leading some even to question his mental state.Remember this was a man who on the campaign trail described Nato as ""obsolete"" and who said that he would end the free ride that he believed many allies - especially in Europe - were taking at the American taxpayers' expense. So this encounter in Munich was an opportunity for Nato allies to weigh up the new Trump team and to try to gauge the new administration's likely direction. Mr Trump sent his Vice-President Mike Pence to Munich to deliver a series of clearly worded messages. Trump 'unwavering' in support for Nato allies, says PenceWhat does Nato want from Trump?And to avoid any doubt his new defence chief, General James Mattis, provided a warm-up act at Nato headquarters at the end of last week - and to ensure nobody mistakes the message Mr Pence himself will be heading to Brussels, the seat of Nato, once the Munich conference is over. Mr Pence used his Munich speech to bring a message of reassurance from the new president. ""The US,"" he said, strongly supports Nato and will be ""unwavering in its commitment to the trans-Atlantic alliance"" .But with so few allies actually meeting the agreed target for defence spending, there was a warning too. ""Let me be clear on this point,"" he stressed, ""the president of the United States expects our allies to keep their word to fulfil this commitment and for most that means the time has come to do more"".This statement was met with hesitant applause - an indication that many Europeans do not welcome being bullied by the Trump White House. Earlier, German Chancellor Angela Merkel had emphasised that military spending alone was not the only measure of the Europeans' commitment to security.  She calmly - but pointedly - took issue with many of the Trump team's putative policies, noting the importance of international multilateral institutions like the EU and the UN (both of which have been condemned by Mr Trump). Indeed at the end of her speech she seemed to take on the central tenet of the Trump campaign - enshrined in the slogan ""America First!"" Looking to the future she posed a fundamental question. ""Will we be able,"" she asked, ""to act in concert together or (will we) fall back into parochial policies?""One of Europe's greatest fears has been Mr Trump's apparent willingness to do a deal with Moscow - not to mention his evident admiration for Russia's leader Vladimir Putin. Mr Trump's emissaries pretty much convinced their European hosts that on key issues - at least for now - there would be no change. General Mattis insisted that Russia had to abide by international law and US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, on a recent visit to Bonn, stressed that agreements like the Minsk accords to end the fighting in Ukraine had to be fully implemented by all sides - including Moscow. Vice-President Pence emphasised the message saying here in Munich that the US would continue to hold Russia to account, even as it searched for areas of common ground.The Russians have almost been bystanders here watching the internal Nato debate from the sidelines. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov returned to a familiar theme - that Nato was essentially an institution of the past. The expansion of the Atlantic Alliance, he said, had led to an unprecedented level of tensions. What was now needed was what he called a ""post-western world order"". So there seems little chance here for President Trump's hope for fresh understanding with Moscow - or at the very least that it will not come at the expense of the European Nato allies, or perhaps even of Ukraine. If there is a deal to be done between Washington and Moscow it will lie elsewhere, perhaps over Syria.This Munich conference will end on Sunday with many of the concerns of the Europeans only partially stilled. For they relate more to the character and outlook of the new US president himself. One of his tweets can undermine policies that have received bipartisan support in Washington for decades. And its not just a style thing: many of Mr Trump's policies remain unclear, even as so many positions inside his team remain unfilled."

It comes just weeks before the government intends to trigger the departure mechanism. In a speech in London, he said that he respected the will of the people, but voters hadn't been given details about the terms on which Britain would exit the EU. Mr Blair argued that what he called the ""cost"" of Brexit was only now becoming clear. The referendum vote, he said, was based on ""imperfect knowledge"" which would now become ""informed knowledge"".It's true that we don't yet know the details of the UK's future relationship with the rest of the EU - that will depend on the deal that is negotiated - but lots was said during the referendum campaign about what Brexit would mean in more general terms. In particular, leading figures in both campaigns said leaving the EU would entail leaving the single market.Mr Blair suggested that immigration was the main issue that propelled Leave to victory in the referendum campaign. But, he argued, the effect of quitting would probably have only a modest impact on overall immigration levels.He pointed out that just over half of migration into the UK comes from outside the EU. That's confirmed by official statistics from the ONS. In the year to June 2016 net migration - the difference between the number of people who arrived and the number of people who left - was 196,000 from outside the EU, compared with 189,000 from inside the EU.The same is true for the gross migration statistics - ie just looking at how many citizens from different parts of the world arrived in the UK.Again, there were slightly more from outside the EU (289,000) than from inside (284,000) along with a smaller number of British citizens returning to live in the UK (77,000). And only an estimated 82,000 or 12.6% of the 650,000 total were EU citizens who arrived looking for work.Theresa May has ruled out introducing a points-based migration system but the government hasn't published details of what it does want to implement. If the new system continues to allow in EU migrants with job offers, as well as students and people coming to join spouses, then Mr Blair's 12% would be, broadly speaking, correct. There could be a bigger impact if the government opts for a capped number of work permits. But about half of total migration will be unaffected no matter what arrangements are made with the EU.This isn't really a fair quotation. It's a reference to an interview given by Philip Hammond on ITV's Peston on Sunday on 26 June.Mr Hammond said: ""I believe it's essential that we protect our access to the single European market. Whether we like it or not, our economy, over 40 years, has become shaped by that access, and to lose that access now would be catastrophic.""But note that he was talking about access to the single market. That's not the same as membership. You don't have to be a member of the single market to have access to it, although the level of access that Britain would have after leaving the single market would depend on what trade relationship was negotiated.It's true that the pound has fallen against the dollar and the euro since the referendum, although not by quite as much as Mr Blair said. It has recovered from its lowest point. Against the dollar, the pound is currently down about 16% compared with its pre-referendum level. Against the euro, it's about 10.5% down.It's also worth noting that the pound/euro exchange rate was at a similar level to now between 2009 and the middle of 2011, so it's hardly unprecedented. Against the dollar, though, the pound has hit multi-decade lows in recent months."

While either party can ask for a line to be put through that box if they have never known their father or been brought up by a step-father, it's an inequality many people like Jenny feel should be addressed.It is also an issue that has provoked anger among MPs from all parties, who have spent several years attempting to bring about a change in the law to allow both parents to have their names and occupations recorded.Their campaign was given a boost when a petition on Change.org, calling for mothers' names to be added to marriage certificates, collected 70,600 signatures in January 2014. The petition said ""marriage should not be seen as a business transaction between the father of the bride and the father of the groom"".Former Prime Minister David Cameron said later that year that he would address this ""inequality in marriage"", adding that the exclusion of mothers' names from marriage registers in England and Wales did ""not reflect modern Britain"".Mr Cameron was gone from Downing Street before any action was taken and it now seems that Conservative MP Edward Argar's Registration of Marriage Bill is the most likely vehicle to overturn the law.A brief history of marriage:His bill, which would update the Marriage Act of 1949, would move the solely paper-based system to a central electronic register online, which would allow the mother's name to be included.It would also bring England and Wales into line with the rest of the UK. In Scotland and Northern Ireland, couples are asked to give the names of both parents on marriage documentation. The same applies for those entering a civil partnership.Similar attempts by Labour and Conservative MPs to change the law fell in 2015 after failing to get ministers' support. Labour frontbencher Christina Rees' private member's bill focused on the narrow point about putting the mother on the certificate. Former Conservative cabinet minister Dame Caroline Spelman's bill wanted marriages listed in a single electronic register instead of in marriage register books.Former home office minister Richard Harrington said at the time ""a combination"" of the two bills ""could deal with things quickly"".Unlike his predecessors', Mr Argar's bill - which is more like Dame Caroline's attempt - has succeeded in getting government backing because it will create a more secure system for keeping marriage records.""The whole point of this bill is the mothers and fathers of the bride and groom will be registered,"" said the Charnwood MP. ""In the great scheme of things it's a minor change, but it's symbolically very important for a large number of people who want a recognition of the role their mother played in their upbringing.""He added: ""It will also give victims of abuse, children of single mothers or errant fathers, the choice over whether to include their mother's names and not their father's.""You will see virtually no outward change in the form of the marriage ceremony, just in the manner that things are recorded. By moving to an online schedule system, we can easily amend the paper documentation - and it's more secure because it doesn't rely on the old parish register that is at risk of theft from the village church.""The church is supportive of the move, and over time it will save the taxpayer millions of pounds in administrative costs.""The bill is set to return to the Commons for its detailed committee stage after the half-term recess, and Mr Argar is hopeful it will receive Royal Assent - and so become law - by the summer.A spokesman for the Home Office said it wanted to see mothers' names recorded on marriage certificates ""as soon as possible"".Mum's done everythingFor Jenny, whose name has been changed to protect her identity, the law change cannot come soon enough. ""My dad's a rapist and he abused me and my sisters, so I never want any reference to him appearing on anything about my future,"" she said. ""He has no right to that - he lost that right many years ago.""I was only seven when the attacks started, and my siblings were much younger. It ended after I told my mother when I was eight and a half.""I've tried to block out what he did to me. ""I have a partner and I'm sure we will get married eventually, but I don't want my father involved in any way.  I'd only want my mum's name on the marriage certificate because as far as I'm concerned she's done everything for us."""

2017-02-21,Meet the EU's chief Brexit negotiator,https://web.archive.org//web/20170222022200/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37542204,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe British papers love a French villain at the heart of the EU.Is Michel Barnier about to succeed Jacques Delors as the object of their affection? The veteran Gaullist already has form.When he was Commissioner for the Internal Market and Financial Services, Mr Barnier was dubbed ""the most dangerous man in Europe"" after taking on the banking sector and championing a cap on bankers' bonuses. But while he alarmed some in the City, and will probably do so again, he also won grudging respect as a tough but even-handed negotiator.He will need all those skills and more in his new role - chief Brexit negotiator at the European Commission. And having moved seamlessly between big jobs in Paris and Brussels - French foreign minister, Commissioner, MEP - he looks well prepared. ""Don't ask me to tell you what will be at the end of the road, we haven't begun to walk yet,"" he told a conference in Brussels last month. Mr Barnier will stick closely to the official EU position of ""no negotiation without notification"" - waiting for the UK to trigger Article 50 to start the formal process of withdrawal. But he's clearly eager to get going.""I am waiting to begin,"" he said. ""I will be ready tomorrow to negotiate, frankly speaking.""And he will bring with him an instinctive pro-European agenda, and a deep knowledge of the workings of the single market.His deputy as chief Brexit negotiator is a German trade expert, Sabine Weyand, adding to the impression that Mr Barnier will lead a team that means business.One of the biggest challenges he (and his boss Jean-Claude Juncker) faces, is to ensure that representatives of the big member states don't sideline him in the Brexit divorce negotiations.But Mr Barnier's long career in French politics means he could well have the ear of the Elysee Palace, especially if - as looks likely - a centre-right candidate wins the French presidency next year. The stakes are so high that there are bound to be some clashes.Mr Barnier has sparred with the UK's Minister for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, before, when the men both served as Europe ministers in the 1990s. It is another reminder that Michel Barnier is a politician first and foremost, rather than a bureaucrat. There have certainly been criticisms - a dash of vanity, a lack of attention to detail. His career has had plenty of downs as well as ups.But he will defend his European vision to the end, and the British government would do well not to underestimate him.At the height of the eurozone crisis, Mr Barnier always refused (politely) to do broadcast interviews in English.""One wrong word,"" he told me once with a smile, ""and we could move markets.""The next few years will be equally challenging."

Scotland voted 62% in favour of Remain.The conversation online was being driven overwhelmingly by pro-independence campaigners. But people who had supported ""Better Together"" during the Scottish referendum vote also spoke about the possibility of a break-away from the UK as a result of the vote over EU membership.  Perhaps the most significant was Scottish author JK Rowling who tweeted: ""Scotland will seek independence now. Cameron's legacy will be breaking up two unions. Neither needed to happen.""Many took to Twitter to express new or strengthened pro-independence feelings in the wake of the latest vote (Just as a reminder: a ""Yes"" vote in Scotland's 2014 referendum was for independence, while the winning ""No"" campaign backed staying in the UK).One old tweet from 2014's independence referendum gained new life on Friday.

But many argue this is based on historical levels of need now out of date.The cross-party F40 group represents 41 local authority members with historically low education funding.Supported by MPs, councillors, education directors, heads, teachers and parents, it has long argued that the existing funding model is outdated, has no rationale and is unfair.It has highlighted how pupils on different sides of a council boundary can attract very different levels of funding. Ministers agreed the existing system was outdated and unjustifiable, and after a series of delays the government published a final consultation on the proposals in December 2016.The plans are set to be implemented in 2018-19.F40 chairman Ivan Ould, a Leicestershire County Council member, said: ""The proposed funding formula indicates a total gain of £183m for F40 member authorities once the national formula is fully implemented from 2019-20.""But that has to be tempered by an outcome that none of us really anticipated: that some poorly funded authorities will not gain, and that many schools, both primary and secondary, within poorly funded authorities will actually lose out.""Earlier this week, the group lobbied MPs, many of whom are alarmed that so many schools in their areas are losers.The group argues:"
2017-02-22,'Magical thinking' on Heathrow expansion,https://web.archive.org//web/20170223075937/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-39053172,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkHeathrow expansion can only be justified if the government proves it will not breach laws on climate change and pollution, MPs say.Ministers say a third runway will not exceed environment limits.However, the Commons Environmental Audit Committee has accused the government of ""magical thinking"" - wishing the problem away without a proper solution.They say ministers must show the expansion will not fuel climate change.Committee chair Mary Creagh told BBC News: ""There's plenty of talk about how the government wants to solve environmental problems at Heathrow, but a total absence of any policy guarantees.""The implication of this is that they think other sectors of the economy like energy and industry are going to have to cut their carbon emissions even more so people can fly more - but the government's been told by its own advisors (the Committee on Climate Change) that's not possible.""The MPs also criticised the government's reliance on a projected increase in electric vehicles on the roads to keep local air pollution within safe limits.""The government has missed already its targets for electric vehicles,"" Ms Creagh said. ""Our committee has no confidence it will meet its target for 2020 or 2030. Ministers have got to put proper policies in place instead of relying on magical thinking."" The committee previously urged a step change in the way the government tackles environmental issues at Heathrow, but says there is little evidence this has happened.The UK has already breached EU limits in London for the pollutant NO2 for 2017. The committee says a new air quality strategy is urgently needed to ensure that airport expansion does not harm public health. The government has said after Brexit that EU environmental laws will be imported wholesale into the UK, but the MPs say they have seen no guarantees that the government will keep pace with future EU air quality laws.The report calls on the ministers to implement an alert system for nearby residents who are especially vulnerable to short-term exposure to air pollution.On climate change, the MPs complain that international aviation emissions from an expanded Heathrow will be 15% higher than the level previously set for 2028-32. They say the government must show how the slack will be taken up by other sectors of the economy, which are already struggling to meet their own emissions targets.They say measures on noise lack ambition, with no precision on the timing of a night flight ban and little evidence that predictable respite can be achieved. The report was welcomed by John Stewart, the chair of HACAN, the campaign group that opposes Heathrow expansion.""The government and Heathrow Airport have got to up their game big-time if they are to have any chance of getting a third runway,"" he said.  ""They have got to prove they can deliver on noise, climate and air pollution - not just say they can.""The report comes just weeks after the government launched a public consultation on a third runway, which ends on 25 May. Later this year or early next year MPs are expected to be asked to vote on the runway. A Department for Transport spokesman said: ""We take our air quality commitments extremely seriously and have been very clear that the new runway will not get the go-ahead unless air quality requirements can be met.The spokesman said the government has no plans to ""water down"" its ambitions on cutting aviation emissions and remains committed to meeting emission reductions targets under the Climate Change Act.

2017-02-22,Budget help promise over business rates,https://web.archive.org//web/20170223075937/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-39053758,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe government has promised measures in the Budget for firms facing the ""steepest increases"" in business rates.Communities Secretary Sajid Javid said it was ""clear to me that more needs to be done to level the playing field and make the system fairer"".A fierce campaign has been waged against rises, which ministers say will affect a quarter of business in the UK.Labour said the government had allowed a ""crisis"" to develop. The rate change is due to happen on 1 April.Businesses pay tax based on the rateable value of their property, including pubs, restaurants, warehouses, factories, shops and offices - and these values are being reassessed for the first time since 2010, meaning changes to the amount many firms will pay.In the face of opposition from business groups and some Conservative MPs, the government has defended the reforms and said 2017-18 ""will see the biggest ever cut in business rates"" and ""three-quarters of all businesses, right across the country, will see their rates either fall or stay the same"".But Mr Javid told the House of Commons he was ""acutely aware"" of problems for some others, saying: ""There are clearly some individual businesses facing particular difficulties.""He added: ""I have always listened to businesses and this situation is no exception. It's clear to me that more needs to be done to level the playing field and make the system fairer.""Mr Javid promised help for those ""facing the steepest increases"".He added that he and Chancellor Philip Hammond were looking at ""how best"" to proceed, telling MPs: ""We expect to be in a position to make an announcement at the time of the Budget in just two weeks' time.""At Prime Minister's Questions earlier, Theresa May was asked about the changes by Green Party MP Caroline Lucas, who said the changes would ""devastate"" the economy in her Brighton Pavilion constituency.The prime minister said it was ""right"" for rates to change to reflect changing property prices, saying the system was underpinned by fairness.She added: ""We also, though, want to support businesses and recognise that, for some, business rates will go up when these revaluations take place.""Mrs May also said there was ""significant funding in place for transitional relief"". For Labour, shadow communities secretary Gareth Thomas said there was a business rates ""crisis"", saying it had taken Mr Javid ""apparently until now to grasp its seriousness"".Asked whether the government was in ""chaos"" over business rates, the prime minister's spokesman said: ""I don't think it is chaos. We've set out our plans to provide a transitional relief fund to make sure that those affected by the rise in business rates have a smooth transition.""He later added: ""The PM was absolutely clear today that there is a transitional fund already in place - and that she has asked the chancellor and the communities secretary to make sure that this is being spent appropriately. ""She also asked them to work to ensure that there was appropriate relief in place for the hardest cases. ""Sajid echoed this exact statement this afternoon - and made clear that we will come back to this issue at Budget. We would never confirm or deny what would be in the Budget this far in advance.""The chairman of the Treasury Select Committee, Conservative MP Andrew Tyrie, has written to the chancellor to ask for ""the facts"" about the changes.He said there were ""several problems"" with the proposals, citing ""considerable concern"" about the impact on smaller firms.The Federation of Small Businesses said it welcomed the PM's ""intervention"" to tackle what it called an ""extremely worrying situation for many small businesses""."
2017-02-22,Income rules for foreign spouses upheld,https://web.archive.org//web/20170223075937/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-39050664,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkIncome rules which stop thousands of British citizens bringing their foreign spouse to the UK are lawful ""in principle"" the Supreme Court has ruled. But children's welfare must be promoted in immigration decisions, judges said.As of 2012, Britons must earn more than £18,600 ($23,140) before a husband or wife from outside the European Economic Area (EEA) can settle in the UK.Judges rejected an appeal by families who argued that the rules breached their human right to a family life. Seven Supreme Court justices hearing the case said the minimum income requirement was ""acceptable in principle"". But they criticised the rules around it, saying they failed to take ""proper account"" of the duty to safeguard and promote the welfare of children when making decisions which affect them. And they ruled there should be an amendment to allow alternative sources of funding, other than a salary or benefits, to be considered in a claim. The rules were introduced by the former coalition government to stop foreign spouses becoming reliant on taxpayers.The minimum income threshold, which also affects people settled in the UK as refugees, rises to £22,400 ($27,870) if the couple have a child who does not have British citizenship - and then by an additional £2,400 ($2,986) for each subsequent child.The markers replaced a previous, more general, requirement to show the Home Office that the incoming partner would not be a drain on public resources and that the couple or family could adequately support themselves. They do not take into account the earnings of the overseas partner - even if they have higher qualifications, or are likely to be employed in higher-paid work than their British spouse. And the threshold does not apply to spouses from within the EEA.Visa rules ""creating price on love""""Just because she happens to fall in love with me and I have the wrong passport, she isn't allowed to live with me in her own country,"" says Spencer Russ, an American who may be deported from the UK, where he lives with his British wife, Laura Segan.Read more about families split by the rulesDelivering their judgement, the justices said the government's rules had the ""legitimate"" aim of ensuring ""that the couple do not have recourse to benefits and have sufficient resources to play a full part in British life"".But they said the rules fail because they do not treat ""the best interests of children as a primary consideration"".By BBC Home Affairs correspondent, Dominic CascianiWhile the couples in this case have won their appeals it's not much of a victory when the Supreme Court has clearly ruled the system is compatible with human rights. Campaigners say they are delighted. But the government now knows the principle of the policy has been endorsed by the highest court in the land as a legitimate way to control immigration. So what does that mean in practical terms? The Home Office will need to make sure that each decision takes into account the rights of children - and whether a couple have other assets -  perhaps a home, savings or substantial financial support from family. That will benefit some of the families - but it also means that in the long run some of the most affected people from poorer Asian communities may still be unable to get permission to bring their husband or wife to Britain. The justices heard appeals in February 2016 from a series of test cases. Two claimants, Abdul Majid and Shabana Javed, are British citizens who have partners who are Pakistani nationals. The third is a Lebanese refugee who cannot find suitable work in the UK despite his postgraduate qualifications. He says his similarly-qualified wife has high earning potential and speaks fluent English. A final case concerns another recognised refugee from the Democratic Republic of Congo whose wife has been barred from settling. In their ruling on Wednesday, the panel, led by Supreme Court deputy president Lady Hale, held that the minimum income requirement (MIR) ""is acceptable in principle"", but that the rules and instructions ""unlawfully fail to take proper account"" of the Home Secretary's duty under the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 to have regard to the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of children when making decisions which affect them.The court ruled on the ""instructions also require amendment to allow consideration of alternative sources of funding when evaluating a claim"" under Article 8 (right to private and family life) of the European Convention on Human Rights.Satbir Singh is a British citizen who is unable to bring his wife to the UK from India, because his more than £60,000 a year income comes from more than one source. He said the vast majority of those affected ""won't get any respite from this ruling, don't have the resources to visit each other, who might have children who are growing up without parents"".   ""It's terribly frustrating to find that very important components of the quality of your life are dictated by a very heartlessly thought out set of rules which seem targeted at nothing apart from achieving a certain set of numbers that the government has set for itself,"" he said. A Home Office spokesman said the court had endorsed its approach in setting an income threshold for family migration that prevents burdens on the taxpayer and ensures migrant families can integrate into our communities.""This is central to building an immigration system that works in the national interest,"" they said.The current rules remained in force, they said, ""but we are carefully considering what the court has said in relation to exceptional cases where the income threshold has not been met, particularly where the case involves a child"".Saira Grant, chief executive at campaigning charity the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, also welcomed the ruling - as a ""real victory for families"". She said the rules had been ""tearing families apart and significantly harming children"".The ruling on considering alternative funding sources was ""a significant victory"" and the government must now ""take immediate steps to protect the welfare of children in accordance with their legal duty""."

Twelve points should be the ceiling.""Sheena Jowett, deputy chairman of the Magistrates' Association, the independent charity representing magistrates in England and Wales, said: ""Magistrates take decisions under clear guidelines, impartially, and on the merits of each individual case. ""Automatic disqualification can be avoided or reduced in cases of 'exceptional hardship'. The process is a robust one and the concept of hardship must be proved to an exceptional level."" Losing a job on its own would rarely qualify, but proving it would mean being unable to pay a mortgage or feed your family, would.The worst offending areas:The statistics were revealed under the Freedom of Information Act to BBC South East.David Nichols, of road safety charity Brake, said the figures were ""absolutely shocking"".He added: ""The penalty points system is supposed to be in place to protect the public from dangerous repeat offenders and it's appalling that these risky repeat offenders are allowed to keep driving.""Common ways people amass so many points:Nick Freeman, a specialist traffic defence lawyer known as Mr Loophole, said he had come across cases similar to the first example. Mr Freeman,  who has represented clients including Jeremy Clarkson and Wayne Rooney, managed to get all the court summons to one date, for one case, ""so the court hears just one argument of exceptional hardship"".People can use the mitigation once every three years, but cannot reuse the reason for the hardship.Mr Freeman said the legislation allowing hardship mitigation was to give people who committed trivial offences another chance.""But it facilitates the current situation. If Parliament doesn't want that situation to continue, the legislation needs changing,"" he added.The DVLA noted there could be a delay between issuing penalties and the court sentence, but the West Yorkshire motorway speeder had been dealt with and was still eligible to drive."
2017-02-22,UK bomber's family deny he received £1m,https://web.archive.org//web/20170223075937/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-39057807,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe family of a British IS fighter who carried out a suicide attack in Iraq deny he received £1m in compensation after being freed from Guantanamo Bay.It has been reported by the Daily Mail that Jamal al-Harith received the payout from the UK government after being freed from captivity in 2004.The family say that figure was ""a group settlement including costs for four innocent people including Jamal"". The Daily Mail says it stands by its story.Al-Harith, who was 50 and from Manchester, was originally known as Ronald Fiddler.He took the name Jamal al-Harith when he converted to Islam, but was known most recently by the nom-de-guerre Abu-Zakariya al-Britani, given to him by so-called Islamic State.Who are Britain’s jihadists?Al-Harith was seized by American forces in Pakistan in 2001, before being sent to Guantanamo Bay - a US prison in Cuba for terrorist suspects.US interrogators found he provided useful information about the Taliban's methods, and he was released after two years. He later joined IS and blew himself up at an Iraqi army base in Mosul this week.Analysis, by Frank Gardner, BBC security correspondentIn the light of how he chose to end his life, the case of Jamal al-Harith is certainly embarrassing for those in government in 2004 and 2010, and for those whose job it was to assess the security threat he posed between 2004 and 2014. But his lawyer has told me that when al-Harith returned from his two years' imprisonment in Guantanamo Bay in March 2004, he had already been so extensively questioned that his interview with British special branch officers lasted just 20 minutes before charges were dropped and he was released. He was assessed - correctly at the time - of being a low security risk to the British population and he spent the next 10 years living openly in and around Manchester with his young family, showing no signs of violent extremism. At some stage, probably around 2013, he became sufficiently radicalised, or even re-radicalised, to go off to Syria to join IS. It was this that MI5 failed to pick up.In a statement, al-Harith's family said they wished ""to express their sorrow and distress at the news of his death"", but were ""concerned about the distorted and over-simplified reports they have seen in the news"". ""The Jamal they knew up until 2001 when he was taken to Guantanamo Bay would not have become involved with a despicable organisation such as so-called Islamic State. He was a peaceful and gentle person,"" it continued.""Whatever he may or may not have done since then they believe from their own experience he was utterly changed by the physical and mental cruelty and the inhuman treatment he endured for two years at Guantanamo."" His relatives insisted he did not receive £1m in compensation, adding: ""The family last heard from him in 2014 and have since then been desperately worried about his fate.""Leon Jameson, al-Harith's older brother, says they last spoke two years ago on the phone, before he went to Syria.Mr Jameson described his sibling as ""fun"" when he was growing up and ""always helping other people"". When asked about his brother's suicide bombing he said: ""I can't actually commend him about it because it isn't right, but he's done it. It's something he believes in, so I'll leave that with him.""He did what he could for other people, which is what he used to always be like.  And he said ""it had been a struggle"" for his brother ever since Guantanamo Bay. ""If he didn't even listen to his wife, none of us could have really changed his mind.""Former Prime Minister Tony Blair released a statement accusing the Daily Mail of ""utter hypocrisy"" after it ran a story about al-Harith on Wednesday headlined: ""Still Think He Wasn't A Danger, Mr Blair? Fury at Labour government's £1m compensation for innocent Brit"".Mr Blair said the man's release in 2004 had ""followed a Parliamentary and massive media campaign led by the Daily Mail... and strongly supported by the then Conservative Opposition"". The former PM continued: ""He was not paid compensation by my government. The compensation was agreed in 2010 by the [coalition] government...""In response, the paper issued a statement saying Mr Blair was ""utterly wrong to accuse the Daily Mail newspaper of inaccuracy over the Ronald Fiddler story"".""However, our sister organisation MailOnline, which is an independently edited website, did publish a misleading headline which said that Mr Blair's government was responsible for the £1m payout to Fiddler.  ""This ran briefly and has since been removed and corrected. MailOnline apologises for this mistake.""It added: ""The fact remains that the actions which led to this payment were all the responsibility of Tony Blair."""

A jury later found the Met had broken health and safety laws, but found there was ""no personal culpability for Commander Cressida Dick"".Ms Dick, 56, left the Met for the Foreign Office after 31 years of service in December 2014.Londoners' to-do list for the new chiefShe was chosen for the commissioner's job ahead of National Police Chiefs' Council chairwoman Sara Thornton, Essex Police chief constable Stephen Kavanagh and Scotland Yard's Mark Rowley.Her appointment means that for the first time all three top policing jobs in the UK are held by women: the Met commissioner, the head of the National Crime Agency and the president of the National Police Chief's Council.Ms Dick's statement said: ""This is a great responsibility and an amazing opportunity. ""I'm looking forward immensely to protecting and serving the people of London and working again with the fabulous women and men of the Met.""Thank you so much to everyone who has taught me and supported me along the way."" By Danny Shaw, home affairs correspondentThe new commissioner will find that when it comes to leading the Met, there's no off-switch. It's a policing organisation like no other in the UK, with a budget of £3bn, a workforce of 43,000 and responsibility for keeping everyone in London - from Barking to Buckingham Palace, from West Norwood to Westminster - safe.The leader of Britain's biggest and most influential police force will come under pressure to make early decisions: on whether to roll out controversial spit-guards, on how to police the Notting Hill Carnival and if Tasers should be extended to all officers.She'll face intense scrutiny from the media, which has a tendency to escalate stories of local difficulties into ones of national importance. And she'll be expected to provide regular updates to the London Assembly, MPs on the home affairs committee, the mayor of London and the home secretary.Five challenges for the new chiefTheresa May said Ms Dick had the ""exceptional qualities"" needed to lead the Met.""Her skills and insights will be crucial in shaping the Met as the job of police reform continues, co-ordinating the national response to the ongoing threat of terrorism and serious criminality as well as keeping Londoners safe,"" the prime minister continued.""In addition, I know she will be a champion for the most vulnerable who the police are there to protect.""Home Secretary Amber Rudd said Ms Dick was taking on ""one of the most demanding, high-profile and important jobs in UK policing, against the backdrop of a heightened terror alert and evolving threats from fraud and cyber crime"".Sir Bernard said his replacement would be ""a brilliant beacon for women within and beyond this force"".And London Mayor Sadiq Khan said she was the ""best possible person"" to take the Met forward.  ""She has already had a long and distinguished career, and her experience and ability has shone throughout this process.""But Mr de Menezes' cousins Patricia Armani and Alex Pereira said her appointment was ""offensive"" to his memory and sent ""the message... that police officers can act with impunity"". Ms Armani said: ""Our family is disappointed that she has now been appointed for such an important role at a time there are many more threats to public security in the form of terrorism. ""What are the guarantees that more innocent people won't be killed by the police in London?""Ms Dick's new post commands a salary of £270,648, plus benefits.She first joined the Met in 1983 after a brief spell in accountancy following her graduation from Oxford University.  In 2009, she became the first woman to be appointed an assistant commissioner at the force, later becoming the national lead for counter-terrorism across the UK.Her work also included leading the reinvestigation into the murder of Stephen Lawrence and the police response to the killing of soldier Lee Rigby.In 2014, she left Scotland Yard to take up a highly sensitive and undisclosed director-general post at the Foreign Office.Her other experience includes taking on internal reforms of Scotland Yard and being one of the two senior officers in charge of security at the London 2012 Olympic Games."

I've been doing them with my kids in the holidays so I may have inadvertently done one,"" Mr Watson confessed to The Huffington Post UK.With his ""inadvertent"" move, Mr Watson follows in the footsteps of premier league footballers, Prince Harry and Hillary Clinton, who have all dabbed since the craze emerged.Dabbing involves the dancer dropping their head and resting it on one arm while simultaneously raising the other.Its birthplace can be traced to the Atlanta hip-hop scene, and it spread during 2015 as NFL players celebrated touchdowns with the move.Footballers including Manchester United stars Paul Pogba and Jesse Lingard brought it to a wider UK audience to celebrate goals.With all eyes on Mr Corbyn's tussle with Theresa May, Mr Watson's effort seemed to pass unnoticed by the massed ranks of MPs, and Speaker John Bercow - but thankfully the Commons cameras captured it in all its glory."
2017-02-22,PM's attack over Troubles' soldier cases,https://web.archive.org//web/20170223075937/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-39053849,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe Prime Minister has attacked those she claims have made a business of dragging soldiers through the courts over incidents in Northern Ireland.Theresa May said it was ""appalling"".She told MPs the government would ensure any Stormont investigative bodies have a legal duty to be fair, balanced and proportionate. Figures obtained by the BBC this month challenge claims that investigations into Troubles killings are unduly focused on those committed by the Army.The PSNI figures show investigations into killings by the Army account for about 30% of its legacy workload.The PM said on Wednesday it was essential the justice system reflects that 90% of killings in Northern Ireland were by terrorists.She said treating them more favourably than Army or police officers would be wrong.""The overwhelming majority of our armed forces serving in Northern Ireland served with great distinction and we owe them a huge debt of gratitude,"" she added.""The situation we have at the moment is that there are cases being pursued against officers who served in Northern Ireland.""What we want to see as we develop the legacy body under the Stormont House Agreement is a proportionate, fair and balanced approach to that.""However, Mrs May failed to respond to one of her own MPs who called for a statute of limitations for bringing prosecutions against soldiers involved in killings in Northern Ireland.When the MP for New Forest East, Julian Lewis, told her that although her answer was welcome he did not think it went far enough, Mrs May said she was aware the government was looking at the issue as part of the Stormont House Agreement.""What we are doing is ensuring the investigative bodies responsible for looking at deaths during the Troubles will operate in a fair, balanced and proportionate manner,"" she added.""We want cases to be considered in chronological order and we want these prosecution protections enshrined in legislation.""We are going to be consulting further on these proposals because we want to make sure that we do get this right.""Mr Lewis said there was no prospect of new credible evidence coming forward against veterans of the Troubles up to 40 years after the event, ""yet people are starting to use the same techniques in Northern Ireland against them as were used against veterans of Iraq"".""Surely the answer has to be a statute of limitations preventing the prosecution of veterans to do with matters that concerned prior to the date of the Belfast Agreement,"" he said."

2017-02-22,Remain supporters have Brexit 'duty',https://web.archive.org//web/20170223075937/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-39038115,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkFormer Tory chancellor Lord Lamont has said it is the ""duty"" of Remain supporters not to undermine the government over Brexit.Lord Lamont urged peers not to attempt to add conditions to the government's Brexit bill as it passed through the Lords.But another ex-chancellor, Labour's Lord Darling, said the government should not get a ""blank cheque"".Peers gave an unopposed second reading to the draft legislation.More than 180 members spoke over the course of the two day debate, which lasted nearly 20 hours. Urging peers to leave the bill unamended, Lord Lamont, who backed a Leave vote in June's referendum, said the views of the Remain side should be taken into account - and added: ""But equally I believe that those who voted to Remain have a duty not to undermine the government's negotiating position.""But Lord Darling told peers: ""I do not accept this argument that from now on those of us on the Remain side should sit back and say nothing and simply give the government a blank cheque to proceed.""He said this was impossible with so many ""unanswered questions"".Liberal Democrat Baroness Kramer said voters should have ""the final word"" on the Brexit deal in a referendum.MPs have already backed the proposed law, authorising Mrs May to inform the EU of the UK's intention to leave.Although there was no formal vote on Tuesday, opposition peers are seeking to amend the bill at a later date to guarantee the rights of EU citizens in Britain and the role of Parliament in scrutinising the process.As the government does not have a majority in the Lords, it is vulnerable to being outvoted if opposition peers - including Labour's 202 and the 102 Lib Dems - join forces. Much will hinge of the actions of the 178 crossbenchers - who are not aligned to any party.Mrs May has said she wants to invoke Article 50 of the 2009 Lisbon Treaty - the formal two-year mechanism by which a state must leave the EU - by the end of March, and the government has warned the House of Lords not to frustrate the process.Among other contributors to the debate, former Labour foreign secretary Lord Owen, who sits as an Independent Social Democrat, said: ""You cannot face this issue and ignore the decision of the referendum.""But equally well, you cannot talk about a United Kingdom without being aware of the fact that a substantial number of people did not vote for it. We have to take account of those divisions as we approach this next and most crucial stage.""And former ambassador to the EU Lord Kerr of Kinlochard, who drew up the Article 50 procedure, said it was not irrevocable and Parliament could invite the government or the country to think again.The UK would remain a full member of the EU throughout the negotiating period and, ""if having looked into the abyss we were to change our minds about withdrawal, we certainly could and no-one in Brussels could stop us"", he added.Winding up the debate, Brexit minister Lord Bridges said the bill should be passed as quickly as possible to allow negotiations with the rest of the EU to start.A clear majority had voted to leave the EU and there could be ""no attempts to remain inside and no attempts to rejoin"", he told peers. He also suggested giving unilateral guarantees over the future of EU nationals living in the UK would not help British expats based in other member states.""They could end up facing two years of uncertainty if any urgency of resolving their status was removed by the UK making a one-sided guarantee,"" he said.Detailed scrutiny of the bill at committee stage is due to take place on 27 February and 1 March. If the bill is not amended, then it could theoretically be approved by the Lords at Third Reading on 7 March, becoming law shortly afterwards.If peers do make changes to the bill, it would put them on a collision course with MPs - who overwhelmingly passed the bill unaltered and would be expected to overturn any Lords amendments."

2017-02-22,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20170223075937/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThis article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide to the UK's vote to leave the European Union. It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 52% to 48%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who resigned on the day after losing the referendum. Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she says she will respect the will of the people. She has said ""Brexit means Brexit"" but there is still a lot of debate about what that will mean in practice especially on the two key issues of how British firms do business in the European Union and what curbs are brought in on the rights of European Union nationals to live and work in the UK. She set out more details of her negotiating hopes in her key speech on Brexit.The UK economy appears to have weathered the initial shock of the Brexit vote, although the value of the pound remains near a 30-year low, but opinion is sharply divided over the long-term effects of leaving the EU. Some major firms such as Easyjet and John Lewis have pointed out that the slump in sterling has increased their costs. Britain also lost its top AAA credit rating, meaning the cost of government borrowing will be higher. But share prices have recovered from a dramatic slump in value, with both the FTSE 100 and the broader FTSE 250 index, which includes more British-based businesses, trading higher than before the referendum. The Bank of England cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - a record low and the first cut since 2009 - after the vote and there has not been the economic slump or recession that some had predicted. The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it has to invoke an agreement called Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May has said she intends to trigger this process by the end of March 2017, meaning the UK will be expected to have left by the summer of 2019, depending on the precise timetable agreed during the negotiations. The government will also enact a Great Repeal Bill which will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. It is expected to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove.After a court battle, the UK's Supreme Court ruled in January that Parliament must be consulted before Article 50 is invoked. This is why a two line Brexit bill is currently making its way through Parliament. MPs have approved it after Labour MPs were told to support it. It has got through its first House of Lords debate with debate and votes on possible changes expected in the next week.Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These men - dubbed the Three Brexiteers - will play a central role in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although it will be Mrs May, as prime minister, who will have the final say. David Cameron's government did not do any emergency planning for Brexit ahead of the referendum and Mrs May has rejected calls to say what her negotiating goals are.Once Article 50 has been triggered, the UK will have two years to negotiate its withdrawal. But no one really knows how the Brexit process will work - Article 50 was only created in late 2009 and it has never been used. Former Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, now Chancellor, wanted Britain to remain in the EU, and he has suggested it could take up to six years for the UK to complete exit negotiations. The terms of Britain's exit will have to be agreed by 27 national parliaments, a process which could take some years, he has argued. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. The UK will continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making.Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Following Theresa May's Brexit recent speech we now know that the UK is not intending to stay in the EU's single market. Although there has been speculation for months about the issue, it would have meant the UK staying under the auspices of the European Court of Justice and having to allow unlimited EU immigration, under freedom of movement rules.Both sides want trade to continue after Brexit with the UK seeking a positive outcome for those who wish to trade goods and services"" - such as those in the City of London and wanting a ""comprehensive free trade deal"" giving the UK ""the greatest possible access"" to the single market. Mrs May says she wants the UK to reach a new customs union deal with the EU. A customs union is where countries agree not to impose tariffs on each others' goods and have a common tariff on goods coming in from elsewhere. The UK is currently part of the EU customs union but that stops the UK being able to do its own trade deals with other countries. Reality Check: How could customs union work?These terms have increasingly been used as debate focused on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people in order to maintain access to the EU single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result.The government has declined to give a firm guarantee about the status of EU nationals currently living in the UK, saying this is not possible without a reciprocal pledge from other EU members about the millions of British nationals living on the continent. EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, will be be able to stay, the chief civil servant at the Home Office has said. The rights of other EU nationals would be subject to negotiations on Brexit and the ""will of Parliament"", he added.A lot depends on the kind of deal the UK agrees with the EU. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions on EU nationals, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.Again, it depends on whether the UK government decides to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages. Citizens' Advice has reminded people their rights have not changed yet and asked anyone to contact them if they think they have been discriminated against following the Leave vote.Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested EU migrants who come to the UK as Brexit nears may not be given the right to stay. He has said there might have to be a cut-off point if there was a ""surge"" in new arrivals.People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote. The day-to-day spending impact is likely to be more significant. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it to remain at least 10% below where it was on 23 June, in the long term. This means imported goods will consequently get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have already been seen and the issue was most notably illustrated by the dispute between Tesco and Marmite's makers about whether prices would be put up or not in the stores.The latest UK inflation figures, for January, showed the CPI inflation rate rising to 1.8%, its highest level for two and a half years, with signs of more cost pressures set to feed through in the months to come.Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration.She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations. As mentioned above, the key issue is whether other EU nations will grant the UK access to the single market, if that is what it wants, while at the same time being allowed to restrict the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK.Mrs May has said she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. It is currently running at 330,000 a year, of which 184,000 are EU citizens, and 188,000 are from outside the EU - the figures include a 39,000 outflow of UK citizens.It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Liberal Democrats - who have just a handful of MPs - have vowed to halt Brexit and keep Britain in the EU if they were to win the next general election.Some commentators, including former House of Commons clerk Lord Lisvane, have argued that a further referendum would be needed to ratify whatever deal the UK hammers out with the EU, but there are few signs political leaders view this as a viable option.Yes. Theresa May has appeared keen to avoid a vote on her negotiating stance, to avoid having to give away her priorities, but Theresa May has said there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. It is worth mentioning that any deal also has to be agreed by the European Parliament - with British MEPs getting a chance to vote on it there.  While there could be limitations on British nationals' ability to live and work in EU countries, it seems unlikely they would want to deter tourists. There are many countries outside the European Economic Area, which includes the 28 EU nations plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway, that British citizens can visit for up to 90 days without needing a visa and it is possible that such arrangements could be negotiated with European countries.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. In theory, the government could, if it wanted, decide to change the colour, which is currently standardised for EU countries, says the BBC's Europe correspondent, Chris Morris.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketNo nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it is ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faces being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. A second independence referendum for the country is now ""highly likely"", she has said, although not in 2017. She has said she wants Scotland to stay in the single market and said Mrs May's decision to rule out the UK staying in the single market ""undoubtedly"" brings the referendum closer.Before his resignation Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said the impact in Northern Ireland would be ""very profound"" and that the whole island of Ireland should now be able to vote on reunification. But, speaking while she was still Northern Ireland Secretary, Theresa Villiers ruled out the call from Sinn Féin for a border poll, saying the circumstances in which one would be called did not exist. The land border is likely to be a key part of the Brexit talks. Theresa May said a priority for her would be negotiating a deal with the EU which allowed a common travel area between the UK and the Republic of Ireland.During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest. But his successor Theresa May has said she will keep it in place, at least for the current Parliament, which is due to last until 2020.So far there has been a cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. There are yet to be signs that rising inflation have worried the Bank of England  enough to consider raising interest rates.  But if that happened it would make mortgages and loans more expensive to repay - but would be good news for savers.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.Eurotunnel boss Jacques Gounon said last November the reintroduction of duty-free would be ""an incredible boost for my business"" but he later said  that remark had been ""light-hearted"". Erik Juul-Mortensen, president of the Tax Free World Association (TFWA) said after the referendum vote ""it is not possible to predict how Brexit will affect the duty free and travel retail industry, and it is wiser not to make assumptions about exactly what the impact will be.""  They are at the moment but no-one knows the longer term prospects for definite. The EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - is not an EU initiative. It was negotiated between countries within a group known as the European Economic Area, often simply referred to as the single market (plus Switzerland, which confusingly is not a member of the EEA, but has agreed access to the single market). Therefore, the future of Britons' EHIC cover could depend on whether the UK decided to sever ties with the EEA.Probably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report. In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two-thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.However, the UK government is committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, the UK government is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR. However, the EU has its own European Court of Justice, whose decisions are binding on EU institutions and member states.Its rulings have sometimes caused controversy in Britain and supporters of a Brexit have called for immediate legislation to curb its powers. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also cited sovereignty and democracy, and they wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Four of the biggest US banks have committed to helping maintain the City's position. But HSBC will move up to 1,000 jobs to Paris, the BBC understands. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Pest control firm Rentokil Initial says it could make £15m extra this year thanks to a weaker currency.Others are less optimistic. Hilary Jones, a director at UK cosmetics firm Lush said the company was ""terrified"" about the economic impact. She added that while the firm's Dorset factory would continue to produce goods for the UK market, products for the European market may be made at its new plant in Germany.Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After the Leave vote, the government will probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""As with most elements of the UK economy, not enough solid data has been published yet to accurately conclude the Brexit effect on house prices. Industry figures have pointed to ""uncertainty"" among buyers and sellers that could potentially change the housing market.So far, the most significant research has come from the respected Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which has published the conclusions of a survey of its members. This primarily records sentiment among surveyors.It found that house prices are expected to fall across the UK in the three months after the referendum vote. However, the dip in prices is only expected to persist over the 12 months from June in London and East Anglia, surveyors predict.House prices were already slowing in central London, owing to the fall-out from changes to stamp duty rules in April.Separate figures from property portal Rightmove suggested the average asking price of houses coming on to the market in England and Wales fell by 0.9%, or £2,647, in July compared with June. It said that agents had reported very few sales had fallen through as a result of the vote.Many potential first-time buyers would welcome a fall in house prices, with ownership among the young falling owing to affordability concerns. Investors in property, or those who have paid off a mortgage and hope to leave homes as inheritance would be unhappy with a long-term reduction in value.  Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law following the decision to leave the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" will not necessarily disappear overnight - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU means the UK will not be part of TTIP. It will have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Former Labour health secretary Lord Owen has said that because of TTIP (see answer above) the only way to protect the NHS from further privatisation was to get out of the EU."

2017-02-22,Who's Who: Theresa May's cabinet,https://web.archive.org//web/20170223075937/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36785814,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkTheresa May is forming her new government after becoming Conservative prime minister. She is continuing to announce her full cabinet - but here's what we know so far. The list will be updated as new appointments are made. Campaigned to Remain in the European Union The former home secretary, 59, becomes the UK's second female prime minister in the wake of David Cameron's resignation after the EU referendum. She had previously served in the Home Office for more than six years. Theresa May: Full profileHow does May's cabinet compare to Cameron's?Campaigned to Leave the EUBoris Johnson succeeds Philip Hammond at the Foreign Office. The former London mayor headed the campaign for the UK to leave the European Union. He did not previously have a ministerial appointment in Mr Cameron's government but accepted an invitation to attend political cabinet. He was not running any department. Mr Johnson, 52, may be one of the best known politicians in the country but the move to foreign secretary is a big step up from his previous role.Read how the world has reacted.Leave campaignerDavid Davis has been appointed to the new cabinet position of secretary of state for exiting the European Union - or ""Brexit secretary"". A veteran Eurosceptic, he has previously held the positions of Conservative party chairman and shadow deputy prime minister. Between 2003 and 2008, he was the shadow home secretary under both Michael Howard and David Cameron. Mr Davis, 67, lost to David Cameron in the 2005 Tory leadership contest. Details about the new Brexit department are still emerging, but it is likely to take the lead in negotiating Britain's departure from the EU and unpicking the thousands of pages of EU rules written into UK law.Theresa May is reported to have ordered civil servants to find a building for the new department.Leave campaignerLiam Fox, 54, has taken on another newly created position as secretary of state for international trade. He was made secretary of state for defence in 2010 but resigned in 2011 over allegations he had given a close friend, lobbyist Adam Werritty, access to the Ministry of Defence and allowed him to join official trips overseas.Like Mr Davis he is a Eurosceptic who voted to leave the EU and he also stood unsuccessfully for the Conservative Party leadership in 2005.He stood again in the latest race to be leader but was eliminated in the first ballot after winning the support of just 16 MPs.Remain campaignerThe appointment to chief whip is a big step up for Gavin Williamson, according to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg.David Cameron's former parliamentary private secretary, he also served as parliamentary private secretary to transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin.The 40-year-old from North Yorkshire was elected MP for South Staffordshire in 2010. As chief whip, he will attend Cabinet meetings.Remain campaignerKaren Bradley takes over from the deposed John Whittingdale as Culture, Media and Sport Secretary. She had been working with Theresa May as a Home Office minister since 2014.She was first elected MP for Staffordshire Moorlands in May 2010.Her appointment comes two months after Mr Whittingdale and the BBC agreed a major overhaul of the corporation.Read more about her appointment here.Leave campaignerAndrea Leadsom, the Conservative leadership candidate who dramatically pulled out of the race, is the new Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Secretary.The prominent Brexit backer is promoted from energy minister to a cabinet role which will see her take responsibility for a farming industry as it faces the end of European Union subsidies. She will also have to fashion a post-Brexit fisheries policy. Green campaigners will be watching carefully to see what happens to environment regulations in areas including wildlife habitats, air pollution and water quality, currently governed by rules from Europe. Mrs Leadsom's public reason for withdrawing from the leadership race was to allow a rapid transition at the top, and give the economy certainty in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. But our political editor Laura Kuenssberg says her friends were saying she was alarmed by the level of scrutiny given to her comments on motherhood reported in the Times.Read more on Mrs Leadsom's motivations for stepping aside here.Baroness Evans of Bowes Park becomes leader of the House of Lords at 40, in her first ministerial role since being ennobled by David Cameron in 2014.She attended London's Henrietta Barnett School and Cambridge University before becoming deputy director of the Conservative research department, deputy director of the Policy Exchange think-tank and chief operating officer of the New Schools Network - the organisation which ran Michael Gove's free schools programme.Remain campaignerDamian Green is appointed the new Work and Pensions Secretary, taking over from Stephen Crabb, who earlier resigned.Mr Green served as an Immigration Minister and Justice Secretary in the coalition government but has been on the backbenches since 2014.Leave campaignerPriti Patel is the new International Development Secretary, a promotion from her role as employment minister which she's held for just a year.Ms Patel became MP for Witham in 2010 and joined the front bench as a Treasury minister in 2014.She is no stranger to controversy, having previously advocated bringing back the death penalty and was accused of ""divide and rule politics"" during the referendum campaign for claiming that ""biased"" immigration policy prevents curry chefs from outside the EU from working in the UK.On her appointment, she immediately faced calls to guarantee the UK's legal commitment to spending 0.7% of GDP on overseas aid.Remain campaignerGreg Clark is secretary of state of a newly-created ministry of business, energy and industrial strategy.His appointment spells the end for a department which put climate change at the top of the agenda.Just eight years after it was created by then-prime minister Gordon Brown, the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) is being merged into Mr Clark's new department and losing the ""climate change"" part of its name.Environmentalists immediately expressed concern that the reshaping of departments showed the government was downgrading climate change as a priority.But Richard Black, director of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU), said Mr Clark's move was ""an excellent appointment"", saying he ""understands climate change, and has written influential papers on the benefits of Britain developing a low-carbon economy"".Remain campaignerJames Brokenshire, who has been working with Theresa May at the Home Office - where he was immigration minister - has been made Northern Ireland Secretary.He takes over from Theresa Villiers, who resigned from the cabinet having been offered another role but saying it was not one ""which I felt I could take on"". Before entering parliament Mr Brokenshire was a partner at a large international law firm.From 2011 to 2015, he served as security minister at the Home Office with responsibility for domestic national security and counter terrorism. This included supporting the home secretary with oversight of the work of MI5 and the national police counter-terrorism network.His responsibilities also included the government's counter-terrorism strategy and he was part of the prime minister's ""extremism taskforce"". He also led negotiations with the Jordanian government to secure the deportation of the radical cleric Abu Qatada.Read more on his appointment here.Remain campaignerDavid Lidington, former Europe Minister, is promoted to Leader of the House. He had been Europe Minister since 2010 but moves across to a post involving the smooth running of the Commons. The Cambridge history graduate and father-of-four has been MP for Aylesbury since 1992. He previously worked for BP and mining firm Rio Tinto.Campaigned to Remain in the EUPhilip Hammond has been named chancellor of the exchequer. He was foreign secretary under David Cameron from 2014 to 2016, having previously served as defence secretary and transport secretary. He replaces George Osborne.Mr Hammond, 60, is seen at Westminster as the ultimate safe pair of hands. Sometimes mocked as ""box office Phil"" for what some see as his dull delivery, he forged a reputation in the shadow Treasury team as the Tories' public spending ""axeman"".He was seen as a Eurosceptic who spoke of withdrawal if the EU were not reformed, but was a Remain campaigner in the referendum. He now has the job of steering Britain's economy through the choppy post-Brexit waters.Read what Mr Hammond has to say on his first day in the job.Remain campaignerAmber Rudd has been made home secretary, filling the vacancy left by Mrs May. Ms Rudd was formerly energy and climate change secretary, a position she held for just one year.During the campaign for Remain in the EU referendum, she warned in a TV debate that she would not trust the new Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson to drive her home at the end of a night out.The former investment banker, venture capitalist, and financial journalist, aged 52, decided to enter politics in her 40s in order to get ""a grip on her life"". She quickly joined the fast track to the top after being elected to Parliament as MP for Hastings and Rye. She was seen as a protege of then Chancellor George Osborne, serving as his parliamentary private secretary before being promoted to junior minister at the Energy and Climate Change department in 2014. Remain campaignerLiz Truss moves from her role as secretary for environment, food and rural affairs to replace Michael Gove as justice secretary.A qualified management accountant, she became MP for South West Norfolk in 2010 and was appointed education minister in 2012.She was brought up in Yorkshire and attended Roundhay, a comprehensive school in Leeds, and went on to read philosophy, politics and economics at Merton College, Oxford.Socially liberal, the 40-year-old was a founder member of the free enterprise group of Conservative MPs arguing for more deregulation of the economy.Remain campaignerJustine Greening has said she is ""absolutely delighted"" to be made the new education secretary, taking over from Nicky Morgan. She was also appointed minister for women and equalities. Her new department will also take on higher and further education, skills and apprenticeships.Ms Greening leaves her international development secretary post, which she was promoted to in October 2011.MP for Putney since 2005, she became economic secretary to the Treasury after the 2010 election, succeeding Philip Hammond as transport secretary after he was promoted to defence secretary.At London's Pride day on 25 June, two days after the Brexit vote, the 47-year-old announced in a tweet she was in a same-sex relationship, saying ""I campaigned for Stronger In but sometimes you're better off out!"".Read more about what's awaiting Ms Greening at the education department.Leave campaignerChris Grayling, Theresa May's leadership campaign chief, has been appointed transport secretary. He was formerly Leader of the House.The most pressing jobs in his in-tray include dealing with the travel chaos caused by Southern Rail's disrupted services, the expansion of airport capacity in south-east England and high speed rail link, HS2.He's got some experience in this department, having served as shadow transport secretary from December 2005 to 2007.The Brexiteer had a surprisingly low-key, restrained referendum, largely refraining from ""blue-on-blue"" attacks. He was also one of the few Vote Leave spokesmen to share a platform with former UKIP leader Nigel Farage. Remain campaignerPatrick McLoughlin leaves his role as transport secretary to become Conservative Party chairman and chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.An MP since 1986, the former miner also served as chief whip, after being appointed to the role in David Cameron's first cabinet.As transport secretary, he was in charge of several large-scale projects including Crossrail and HS2. The 58-year-old said he was ""very pleased indeed"" with his new role.Remain campaignerSajid Javid is moved sideways from business secretary to secretary of the department for communities and local government.Mr Javid, considered a protege of former chancellor George Osborne's, held the culture secretary position before being appointed to the business role last year and is a former managing director of Deutsche Bank. The 46-year-old University of Exeter graduate stood on a ""joint ticket"" with Stephen Crabb for the leadership election, hoping to be chancellor if Mr Crabb had become PM.Remain campaignerMichael Fallon has kept his job at the Ministry of Defence - a position the 64-year-old has held since 2014.He was Conservative MP for Darlington from 1983 to 1992 - initially during Margaret Thatcher's time in Downing Street - and after leaving Parliament, he was later re-elected as MP for Sevenoaks in 1997.A former Conservative Party deputy chairman, he has previously served as energy and business minister, and before that secretary of state for business and enterprise.Seen as a safe pair of hands in Westminster, he described himself as a ""pretty reluctant Remainer"" after the EU referendum.Remain campaignerDespite earlier speculation, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt remains in his post.The 49-year-old was appointed culture secretary in David Cameron's first coalition government, a role he held for two years - including while London played host to the 2012 Olympic Games.He took over the health portfolio following a cabinet reshuffle in 2012, and described the appointment as the ""biggest privilege of my life"". Most recently, Mr Hunt has been locked in a battle with the British Medical Association over a new contract for junior doctors, which has led to a series of strikes.Remain campaignerDavid Mundell will continue as Secretary of State for Scotland.Mr Mundell, the only Scottish Conservative MP, said his focus was now on ""ensuring Scotland gets the best possible deal out of the EU negotiations"".Former prime minister David Cameron first appointed Mr Mundell to the post when he held his Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale seat for the third consecutive election in 2015.Remain campaignerMay's cabinet: Who's in and who's out? Alun Cairns, MP for the Vale of Glamorgan, remains in his cabinet role as secretary of state for Wales.He was appointed to the post just four months ago so there was little surprise that he will retain his position. The 45-year-old, who was born in Swansea and is a graduate of the University of Wales, Newport, was elected as MP for the Vale of Glamorgan in 2010. He worked in banking for a decade before his election to the Welsh Assembly. Remain campaignerGeorge Osborne has been fired as chancellor.He had been in the Treasury since 2010 - throughout David Cameron's tenure in Downing Street. He had also been first secretary of state since May 2015. A key ally of Mr Cameron, Mr Osborne tweeted it had been a ""privilege"" to be chancellor, adding: ""Others will judge - I hope I've left the economy in a better state than I found it.""Leave campaignerMichael Gove has been fired as justice secretary. The former Times journalist also served under David Cameron as education secretary in the coalition government, and as chief whip.He successfully campaigned for Brexit alongside Boris Johnson - but later withdrew his support for his colleague to be Conservative leader and prime minister, instead standing himself. He was eliminated in the final round of voting by MPs in third place.His surprise move to stand for the leadership and therefore to become prime minister effectively dashed Mr Johnson's hopes of running.Remain campaignerNicky Morgan is to leave her post as education secretary. The 43-year-old, who qualified as a lawyer, became an MP in 2010 and rose to the cabinet position of minister for women and equalities in 2013.London-born Ms Morgan replaced Michael Gove as education secretary in 2014. She reportedly considered standing in the Conservative leadership contest, but ultimately threw her support behind leave campaigner Mr Gove, despite campaigning for a Remain vote herself.In a tweet, she said she was ""disappointed"" not to be continuing her work in the education department, before congratulating her successor Justine Greening, saying she was ""committed to excellence in education"".Remain campaignerWork and Pensions Secretary Stephen Crabb has resigned from government ""in the best interests of my family"". He was one of the four contenders who lost out to Theresa May for the Conservative leadership.BBC political correspondent Vicki Young says it's not yet known whether Mr Crabb was offered a post he did not want or had just decided to resign from the government, possibly following some newspaper stories about his private life at the weekend. Read more about Mr Crabb here.Leave campaignerJohn Whittingdale has left his post as culture secretary. The Leave campaigner was vice-chairman of the influential group of Tory MPs called the 1922 Committee until he took over the portfolio for culture, media and sport after the general election in 2015 from Sajid Javid.In a tweet, he said it had been ""a privilege"" to serve as culture secretary, and wished his successor ""every success"".  Leave campaignerTheresa Villiers steps down as Northern Ireland secretary, saying she declined an offer of another role from the new prime minister.Former barrister Ms Villiers, MP for Chipping Barnet, had held the Northern Ireland portfolio since 2012. Prior to that, she was a Member of the European Parliament for six years.In December 2005, Mr Cameron promoted her to shadow chief secretary to the Treasury. In 2007, she was made a shadow transport minister, a brief she continued to hold when the coalition came to power.She was among prominent figures who campaigned for Brexit. She said Mrs May had been ""kind enough to offer me a role"" but added that it was ""not one which I felt I could take on"".Read more about Ms Villiers here.Remain campaignerOliver Letwin has been sacked from his role as Cabinet Office minister and chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.The long-time MP started his political career as a policy adviser to Margaret Thatcher's government. After becoming elected an MP in 1997 he went on to serve in high profile shadow cabinet posts under then Tory-leader Michael Howard, including shadow home secretary and shadow chancellor.A mainstay of the Cameron years, he served as minister for government policy under the coalition government, and continued as a cabinet member following the 2015 general election.However, the 60-year-old may be better known by some for throwing parliamentary papers into a public bin in St James's Park and apologising for comments he made about black people days after the 1985 Broadwater Farm riot in north London. Remain campaignerChief Whip Mark Harper leaves his post to make way for David Cameron's former parliamentary private secretary Gavin Williamson.In a tweet, the MP for the Forest of Dean, who held the chief whip post for one year, said: ""I have decided to leave the Government & return to the backbenches. I'll continue to loyally support HMG & @theresa_may as our new PM."" Remain campaignerBaroness Stowell of Beeston moves aside as Leader of the House of Lords, to be succeeded by 40-year-old Baroness Evans.Of her successor, she tweeted: ""Baroness Evans will be a fantastic Leader of the House of Lords. She is a great woman. Congratulations and much love to Nats.""Nottingham-born Baroness Stowell was appointed to the Lords role in July 2014, having become a peer in 2011.Before taking up her peerage, she worked for the BBC, as a civil servant and ran William Hague's office when he was leader of the Conservative Party."

In fact it would rank about 30th. But what drew Mr Macron to the UK was perhaps not so much the number as the type of French people living in its capital. Many are young, educated, upwardly and geographically mobile - exactly the constituency he has galvanised at home.Opinion polls suggest he has a chance of reaching the second-round presidential run-off in May and could even win the presidency.Queuing to hear him speak in Westminster on Tuesday was Elise Siouve, 25, a biotechnology postgraduate at Cambridge University, who felt Mr Macron ""understands the need to adapt to social and economic changes"".Another Cambridge student, Benjamin Vendrand-Maillet, 24, has set up a unit of Macron supporters at the university. For him, the centrist's market-friendly policies would work ""for all French people, whether rich or poor, young or old"" and he was best placed to defeat the populist Front National. The main challenge for French candidates campaigning abroad is that turnout is low among expats. In the UK, it is typically about 30%. Why bother to vote when you have decided to make another country your home?But Mr Macron could benefit from the UK's vote to leave the EU, which he deeply regrets. French residents who may suddenly be unsure of their long-term status in the UK could find renewed interest in politics back home. This is the case for Sylvie, a Macron fan who is studying for a doctorate in Oxford. ""I lost interest in France for four years because I found what was going on there dispiriting,"" she says. ""Since Brexit I've realised that I might have to go back to France, so I'm much more involved now."" Restating the message he had delivered to UK Prime Minister Theresa May earlier in the day, Mr Macron promised the crowd of about 2,000 that he would attract talent back to France by freeing up the economy and encouraging risk-taking and enterprise. He said he had been shocked when a French person he met on the Eurostar train to London had told him that he had gone to Britain to establish his start-up business because he had found it impossible to do so at home. ""What is at stake in this campaign,"" he said to loud applause, ""is making sure that women and men who are willing to create jobs and wealth, who want to change their own lives and that of others, can never say 'I tried to do it in France but it's better to do it a two-hour Eurostar ride away'. I don't want to hear that ever again."" Mr Macron is hoping to buck an international trend towards anti-globalisation populism in a country where market reforms have never been popular. The five-horse race for the French presidency remains wide open. In recent weeks polls have consistently placed far-right leader Marine Le Pen ahead in the first round on 23 April. But they have also suggested she would lose the run-off two weeks later. That suggests the top prize in this election could go to the initial runner-up.Mr Macron surged ahead of his rivals in January but his support has wobbled over the past week, following an outcry over his comment that the colonisation of Algeria had been a ""crime against humanity"". Mainstream conservative Francois Fillon appears to be staging a comeback after damaging allegations over payments to his wife. Two left-wing candidates are not far behind. But what is clear is that the winning candidate will be the one most able to mobilise his constituency - hence the potential importance of the expat vote in this race. ""It is too close to call,"" says Benedicte Paviot, London correspondent for France 24 television. ""French presidential candidates can't afford to ignore French nationals abroad."" "

The government's figures are for the situation after any appeals have been completed, so they depend on how accurately it has predicted their outcome.The government has produced tables showing how much business rates would rise or fall in the coming year, broken down by region of the country and type of business.The overall effect of all the changes comes to zero, which means that the policy is revenue neutral. But there is a key caveat at the bottom of the table, which is that the figures are: ""Before inflation and the adjustment to the multiplier for future appeal outcomes.""The inflation part is widely known. The measure of inflation used will become CPI (Consumer Price Index) instead of RPI (Retail Price Index), which will usually mean the increase is smaller, but that change will not happen until 2020. Increasing rates for RPI will add about 2% per year.But the other part is a bit more complicated - it is the adjustment required to make sure that the changes in rates are revenue neutral even after some businesses have appealed against the rated value of their premises and won. Analysis from the property consultants Gerald Eve suggested that the adjustment would be between four and five percentage points. They did that by working out how much business rates would change across the country to find out what adjustment would then be needed to make the policy revenue neutral again.They add that including both the inflation and the appeals adjustment means that business rates will fall in 135 of the 326 local authorities in England, not 259 as the government claimed. The Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) has strongly disputed suggestions that it has misled people with its figures, but has not disputed the suggestion that the appeals adjustment is between four and five percentage points.Speaking on the Today Programme, Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen said he thought the figures provided, ""might not be giving the picture that businesses in the real world are going to get when they get their bills"".This is certainly true. The DCLG has been clear that its figures are before inflation and the appeals adjustment.The government's figures are for the situation after any appeals have been completed, so they depend on how accurately it has predicted their outcome.Read more from Reality Check"
2017-02-22,Future of EU,https://web.archive.org//web/20170223075937/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39032192,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkMany Europeans eye the months ahead with foreboding. They see anti-establishment parties on the ascendancy. Angela Merkel - for so long Frau Europe - may lose power. And the financial markets are skittish over the possibility of a Marine Le Pen victory in France. Every edge up in her poll ratings sends bond yields rising.And yet an entirely different scenario may play out. It is quite possible that before the end of the year observers will declare that the Brexit-Trump tide has turned and that European integration has found new champions.First to the politics: in the Netherlands Geert Wilders has a history of under-performing at the polls. Even if he emerges as the leader of the largest party after the elections in March, he will struggle to get a foothold in government. The contest that preoccupies Europe's political class, however, is France. The conventional wisdom is that Marine Le Pen will win the first round in the presidential elections but be substantially defeated in round two. But France is on edge, gloomy and unsure of itself. She has expanded her lead in the polls and closed the gap on her most likely challenger in the second round, Emmanuel Macron. Still, he retains a 16% poll lead.But observers no longer trust the polls, and they fear the unforeseen event that could turn even more voters against governing elites.Yet if Marine Le Pen loses, as seems most likely, Europe could be facing an entirely different future. Currently the candidate most likely to win in France is Mr Macron. Yes, he's a novice: a man who has never been elected to high office. He has been drawing the crowds because he has sold himself as a new politician, neither left nor right.As the campaign gets under way, Marine Le Pen will be scathing, dismissing Mr Macron as an international banker, the epitome of the failed global elite, and the man who was Economy Minister under Francois Hollande. Mr Macron has yet to define himself, and he may yet stumble. But if he made it to the Elysee Palace, Europe and France would have a pro-European president, committed to the survival of the euro and the alliance with Germany.At the same time, Germany has grown more restless and more open to change. Some see Angela Merkel, who is hoping for a fourth term as chancellor, as weary and burnt-out. Some of her zeal for power has gone. And many Germans will forever blame her for allowing more than a million refugees into the country.Her main political opponent, the Social Democratic Party, has a new standard bearer in Martin Schulz. In the past month, the SPD has surged 12 points, even surpassing Mrs Merkel's Christian Democratic Union.Mr Schulz is a former President of the European Parliament. For a long time in German politics, he has been known as ""Mr Europe"". He has a good back-story: he's a former bookseller without a high school degree. He is a straight-talker, passionate about Europe and further integration. His greatest strength is his unbridled passion to succeed, his weakness is a love of power and some of its trappings, which he demonstrated in Brussels. He also may stumble, having not yet declared his policy on refugees. And never underestimate the appeal of Angela Merkel and her safe pair of hands. But the crowds are turning out for Mr Schulz, much as they have done for Mr Macron in France. If both men were to win, the outlook in Europe would change suddenly and dramatically.Both are European integrationists who would look to deepen and strengthen the European project. Together, they would breathe new life into the Franco-German relationship that has always been the engine room of the EU. Both, politicians from the centre-left, would loosen austerity further and favour spending on infrastructure projects to help countries such as Italy escape stagnation. There would be little generosity from either man towards Britain as it starts to negotiate its exit from the European Union. Mr Macron has said that it will be ""pretty tough"" on the UK and Mr Schulz would want to see the UK pays a price for its departure. As this European election season begins, no-one yet knows what the Trump effect will be on Europe. Will US President Donald Trump's victory encourage voters that they can support anti-immigration candidates who want powers returned to the nation states and, in the case of France, have a vote on membership of the European Union?Or will President Trump deter voters from taking further risks? Will voters turn away from the United States - whose president has openly discussed which country would leave the EU next - and incline towards building a Europe more confident in its own values and security? The President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, has said Europe wants the US's ""wholehearted and unequivocal support for the idea of a united Europe"". It may not be forthcoming, and the insecurity may yet prompt some voters to back deeper European integration rather the outsiders, the insurgents, the challengers.For Europe, the script for 2017 is a long way from being written and the outcome may yet surprise."
2017-02-22,Jonathan Marcus,https://web.archive.org//web/20170223075937/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39017879,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe Munich Security Conference is at one and the same time an annual jamboree for senior officials and think-tankers and a place where former officials and corporate movers-and-shakers meet up. But it also affords an opportunity for a whole series of behind the scenes bilateral meetings. And once every four years it is the place where Europe takes stock of a new US administration.This year the meeting had added significance since the man in the White House, Donald Trump, is unlike any other president in living memory. His supporters believe he is the man to overturn the ""establishment"" in Washington and to get things done. His detractors believe he is unfit for high office, his erratic behaviour leading some even to question his mental state.Remember this was a man who on the campaign trail described Nato as ""obsolete"" and who said that he would end the free ride that he believed many allies - especially in Europe - were taking at the American taxpayers' expense. So this encounter in Munich was an opportunity for Nato allies to weigh up the new Trump team and to try to gauge the new administration's likely direction. Mr Trump sent his Vice-President Mike Pence to Munich to deliver a series of clearly worded messages. Trump 'unwavering' in support for Nato allies, says PenceWhat does Nato want from Trump?And to avoid any doubt his new defence chief, General James Mattis, provided a warm-up act at Nato headquarters at the end of last week - and to ensure nobody mistakes the message Mr Pence himself will be heading to Brussels, the seat of Nato, once the Munich conference is over. Mr Pence used his Munich speech to bring a message of reassurance from the new president. ""The US,"" he said, strongly supports Nato and will be ""unwavering in its commitment to the trans-Atlantic alliance"" .But with so few allies actually meeting the agreed target for defence spending, there was a warning too. ""Let me be clear on this point,"" he stressed, ""the president of the United States expects our allies to keep their word to fulfil this commitment and for most that means the time has come to do more"".This statement was met with hesitant applause - an indication that many Europeans do not welcome being bullied by the Trump White House. Earlier, German Chancellor Angela Merkel had emphasised that military spending alone was not the only measure of the Europeans' commitment to security.  She calmly - but pointedly - took issue with many of the Trump team's putative policies, noting the importance of international multilateral institutions like the EU and the UN (both of which have been condemned by Mr Trump). Indeed at the end of her speech she seemed to take on the central tenet of the Trump campaign - enshrined in the slogan ""America First!"" Looking to the future she posed a fundamental question. ""Will we be able,"" she asked, ""to act in concert together or (will we) fall back into parochial policies?""One of Europe's greatest fears has been Mr Trump's apparent willingness to do a deal with Moscow - not to mention his evident admiration for Russia's leader Vladimir Putin. Mr Trump's emissaries pretty much convinced their European hosts that on key issues - at least for now - there would be no change. General Mattis insisted that Russia had to abide by international law and US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, on a recent visit to Bonn, stressed that agreements like the Minsk accords to end the fighting in Ukraine had to be fully implemented by all sides - including Moscow. Vice-President Pence emphasised the message saying here in Munich that the US would continue to hold Russia to account, even as it searched for areas of common ground.The Russians have almost been bystanders here watching the internal Nato debate from the sidelines. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov returned to a familiar theme - that Nato was essentially an institution of the past. The expansion of the Atlantic Alliance, he said, had led to an unprecedented level of tensions. What was now needed was what he called a ""post-western world order"". So there seems little chance here for President Trump's hope for fresh understanding with Moscow - or at the very least that it will not come at the expense of the European Nato allies, or perhaps even of Ukraine. If there is a deal to be done between Washington and Moscow it will lie elsewhere, perhaps over Syria.This Munich conference will end on Sunday with many of the concerns of the Europeans only partially stilled. For they relate more to the character and outlook of the new US president himself. One of his tweets can undermine policies that have received bipartisan support in Washington for decades. And its not just a style thing: many of Mr Trump's policies remain unclear, even as so many positions inside his team remain unfilled."
2017-02-22,'Block him out',https://web.archive.org//web/20170223075937/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38096514,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkIf Jenny ever gets married, there will be no dad walking her down the aisle and, if she gets her way, no mention of him on her marriage certificate either.This is because, according to the twenty-something professional, the man who sexually abused her for 18 months from the age of seven ""lost any right to be called my father"".Despite his horrific betrayal of the relationship between father and daughter, the current law gives the option for only his name and occupation to be recorded on her future marriage certificate - but not that of her mother ""who has been mum and dad all wrapped up in one"".This system, of recording only the names of the father of the bride and groom on the certificate, dates back to the early years of Queen Victoria's reign. While either party can ask for a line to be put through that box if they have never known their father or been brought up by a step-father, it's an inequality many people like Jenny feel should be addressed.It is also an issue that has provoked anger among MPs from all parties, who have spent several years attempting to bring about a change in the law to allow both parents to have their names and occupations recorded.Their campaign was given a boost when a petition on Change.org, calling for mothers' names to be added to marriage certificates, collected 70,600 signatures in January 2014. The petition said ""marriage should not be seen as a business transaction between the father of the bride and the father of the groom"".Former Prime Minister David Cameron said later that year that he would address this ""inequality in marriage"", adding that the exclusion of mothers' names from marriage registers in England and Wales did ""not reflect modern Britain"".Mr Cameron was gone from Downing Street before any action was taken and it now seems that Conservative MP Edward Argar's Registration of Marriage Bill is the most likely vehicle to overturn the law.A brief history of marriage:His bill, which would update the Marriage Act of 1949, would move the solely paper-based system to a central electronic register online, which would allow the mother's name to be included.It would also bring England and Wales into line with the rest of the UK. In Scotland and Northern Ireland, couples are asked to give the names of both parents on marriage documentation. The same applies for those entering a civil partnership.Similar attempts by Labour and Conservative MPs to change the law fell in 2015 after failing to get ministers' support. Labour frontbencher Christina Rees' private member's bill focused on the narrow point about putting the mother on the certificate. Former Conservative cabinet minister Dame Caroline Spelman's bill wanted marriages listed in a single electronic register instead of in marriage register books.Former home office minister Richard Harrington said at the time ""a combination"" of the two bills ""could deal with things quickly"".Unlike his predecessors', Mr Argar's bill - which is more like Dame Caroline's attempt - has succeeded in getting government backing because it will create a more secure system for keeping marriage records.""The whole point of this bill is the mothers and fathers of the bride and groom will be registered,"" said the Charnwood MP. ""In the great scheme of things it's a minor change, but it's symbolically very important for a large number of people who want a recognition of the role their mother played in their upbringing.""He added: ""It will also give victims of abuse, children of single mothers or errant fathers, the choice over whether to include their mother's names and not their father's.""You will see virtually no outward change in the form of the marriage ceremony, just in the manner that things are recorded. By moving to an online schedule system, we can easily amend the paper documentation - and it's more secure because it doesn't rely on the old parish register that is at risk of theft from the village church.""The church is supportive of the move, and over time it will save the taxpayer millions of pounds in administrative costs.""The bill is set to return to the Commons for its detailed committee stage after the half-term recess, and Mr Argar is hopeful it will receive Royal Assent - and so become law - by the summer.A spokesman for the Home Office said it wanted to see mothers' names recorded on marriage certificates ""as soon as possible"".Mum's done everythingFor Jenny, whose name has been changed to protect her identity, the law change cannot come soon enough. ""My dad's a rapist and he abused me and my sisters, so I never want any reference to him appearing on anything about my future,"" she said. ""He has no right to that - he lost that right many years ago.""I was only seven when the attacks started, and my siblings were much younger. It ended after I told my mother when I was eight and a half.""I've tried to block out what he did to me. ""I have a partner and I'm sure we will get married eventually, but I don't want my father involved in any way.  I'd only want my mum's name on the marriage certificate because as far as I'm concerned she's done everything for us."""
2017-02-22,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20170223075937/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-39007019,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkFormer Prime Minister Tony Blair has launched a campaign to try to persuade the British people to change their minds about leaving the European Union. It comes just weeks before the government intends to trigger the departure mechanism. In a speech in London, he said that he respected the will of the people, but voters hadn't been given details about the terms on which Britain would exit the EU. Mr Blair argued that what he called the ""cost"" of Brexit was only now becoming clear. The referendum vote, he said, was based on ""imperfect knowledge"" which would now become ""informed knowledge"".It's true that we don't yet know the details of the UK's future relationship with the rest of the EU - that will depend on the deal that is negotiated - but lots was said during the referendum campaign about what Brexit would mean in more general terms. In particular, leading figures in both campaigns said leaving the EU would entail leaving the single market.Mr Blair suggested that immigration was the main issue that propelled Leave to victory in the referendum campaign. But, he argued, the effect of quitting would probably have only a modest impact on overall immigration levels.He pointed out that just over half of migration into the UK comes from outside the EU. That's confirmed by official statistics from the ONS. In the year to June 2016 net migration - the difference between the number of people who arrived and the number of people who left - was 196,000 from outside the EU, compared with 189,000 from inside the EU.The same is true for the gross migration statistics - ie just looking at how many citizens from different parts of the world arrived in the UK.Again, there were slightly more from outside the EU (289,000) than from inside (284,000) along with a smaller number of British citizens returning to live in the UK (77,000). And only an estimated 82,000 or 12.6% of the 650,000 total were EU citizens who arrived looking for work.Theresa May has ruled out introducing a points-based migration system but the government hasn't published details of what it does want to implement. If the new system continues to allow in EU migrants with job offers, as well as students and people coming to join spouses, then Mr Blair's 12% would be, broadly speaking, correct. There could be a bigger impact if the government opts for a capped number of work permits. But about half of total migration will be unaffected no matter what arrangements are made with the EU.This isn't really a fair quotation. It's a reference to an interview given by Philip Hammond on ITV's Peston on Sunday on 26 June.Mr Hammond said: ""I believe it's essential that we protect our access to the single European market. Whether we like it or not, our economy, over 40 years, has become shaped by that access, and to lose that access now would be catastrophic.""But note that he was talking about access to the single market. That's not the same as membership. You don't have to be a member of the single market to have access to it, although the level of access that Britain would have after leaving the single market would depend on what trade relationship was negotiated.It's true that the pound has fallen against the dollar and the euro since the referendum, although not by quite as much as Mr Blair said. It has recovered from its lowest point. Against the dollar, the pound is currently down about 16% compared with its pre-referendum level. Against the euro, it's about 10.5% down.It's also worth noting that the pound/euro exchange rate was at a similar level to now between 2009 and the middle of 2011, so it's hardly unprecedented. Against the dollar, though, the pound has hit multi-decade lows in recent months."

The veteran Gaullist already has form.When he was Commissioner for the Internal Market and Financial Services, Mr Barnier was dubbed ""the most dangerous man in Europe"" after taking on the banking sector and championing a cap on bankers' bonuses. But while he alarmed some in the City, and will probably do so again, he also won grudging respect as a tough but even-handed negotiator.He will need all those skills and more in his new role - chief Brexit negotiator at the European Commission. And having moved seamlessly between big jobs in Paris and Brussels - French foreign minister, Commissioner, MEP - he looks well prepared. ""Don't ask me to tell you what will be at the end of the road, we haven't begun to walk yet,"" he told a conference in Brussels last month. Mr Barnier will stick closely to the official EU position of ""no negotiation without notification"" - waiting for the UK to trigger Article 50 to start the formal process of withdrawal. But he's clearly eager to get going.""I am waiting to begin,"" he said. ""I will be ready tomorrow to negotiate, frankly speaking.""And he will bring with him an instinctive pro-European agenda, and a deep knowledge of the workings of the single market.His deputy as chief Brexit negotiator is a German trade expert, Sabine Weyand, adding to the impression that Mr Barnier will lead a team that means business.One of the biggest challenges he (and his boss Jean-Claude Juncker) faces, is to ensure that representatives of the big member states don't sideline him in the Brexit divorce negotiations.But Mr Barnier's long career in French politics means he could well have the ear of the Elysee Palace, especially if - as looks likely - a centre-right candidate wins the French presidency next year. The stakes are so high that there are bound to be some clashes.Mr Barnier has sparred with the UK's Minister for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, before, when the men both served as Europe ministers in the 1990s. It is another reminder that Michel Barnier is a politician first and foremost, rather than a bureaucrat. There have certainly been criticisms - a dash of vanity, a lack of attention to detail. His career has had plenty of downs as well as ups.But he will defend his European vision to the end, and the British government would do well not to underestimate him.At the height of the eurozone crisis, Mr Barnier always refused (politely) to do broadcast interviews in English.""One wrong word,"" he told me once with a smile, ""and we could move markets.""The next few years will be equally challenging."

Scotland voted 62% in favour of Remain.The conversation online was being driven overwhelmingly by pro-independence campaigners. But people who had supported ""Better Together"" during the Scottish referendum vote also spoke about the possibility of a break-away from the UK as a result of the vote over EU membership.  Perhaps the most significant was Scottish author JK Rowling who tweeted: ""Scotland will seek independence now. Cameron's legacy will be breaking up two unions. Neither needed to happen.""Many took to Twitter to express new or strengthened pro-independence feelings in the wake of the latest vote (Just as a reminder: a ""Yes"" vote in Scotland's 2014 referendum was for independence, while the winning ""No"" campaign backed staying in the UK).One old tweet from 2014's independence referendum gained new life on Friday.

Labour's Gareth Snell held Stoke-on-Trent Central with 7,853 votes, seeing off a challenge from UKIP leader Paul Nuttall who got 5,233.Labour had held both seats since their creation but was forced to defend them when two former frontbenchers, Tristram Hunt and Jamie Reed, resigned as MPs.Eleven famous by-electionsProfessor John Curtice, of Strathclyde University, said the Copeland result was the best by-election performance by a governing party in terms of the increase in its share of the vote since January 1966.Ms Harrison, who had been joined by Prime Minister Theresa May on the campaign trail, got 44.3% of the vote, increasing the Conservatives' vote share by more than 8%.In her victory speech, Ms Harrison said: ""It's been very clear talking to people throughout this campaign that [Labour leader] Jeremy Corbyn doesn't represent them.""They want a party which is on the side of ordinary working people, which will respect the way we voted in the referendum and which will build a country which represents everyone. That's why they voted for me tonight.""Mr Corbyn said the party's ""message was not enough to win through in Copeland"" but hailed victory in Stoke as a ""decisive rejection of UKIP's politics of division and dishonesty"". He added: ""Labour will go further to reconnect with voters and break with the failed political consensus.""In Stoke-on-Trent, UKIP had hoped to capitalise on voters' leanings towards Brexit - the area voted strongly to leave the EU in June.The questions facing Labour in Copeland are tumbling UKIP's way here in Stoke.A party whose very success in achieving the thing they were set up to achieve, Brexit, brought with it a blunt question - what is the point of them now?The answer sounded like this: winning traditionally Labour seats from Labour.And yet here in Stoke-on-Trent, a hubbub of Brexiteer jubilation after the referendum, they failed.UKIP insists this seat was always well down their target list.But on a night where Labour was sufficiently vulnerable to lose a previously rock-solid seat in Cumbria, UKIP's still the bridesmaid not the bride in the Potteries.All of which begs two questions: If not here, where? If not now, when?Both the Labour and UKIP candidates had tough moments during their campaigns, with Mr Snell apologising over old social media posts about women appearing on television and Mr Nuttall facing a backlash over false claims he lost close friends in the Hillsborough tragedy.But in his victory speech, the new Labour MP Gareth Snell said voters had ""chosen the politics of hope over the politics of fear"".""This city will not allow ourselves to be defined by last year's referendum and we will not allow ourselves to be divided by the result,"" he said.He said the result was ""a victory for the whole Labour Party and Labour movement"".However Labour's share of the vote was 37% - slightly down on the 39.3% it got in 2015. UKIP got 24.7% of the vote and the Conservatives, who came a close third, 24.4% - both slightly higher than their 2015 vote shares.Speaking to journalists after the result, UKIP leader Mr Nuttall said his party's ""time would come"".""There's a lot more to come from us,"" he said.""We are not going anywhere, I'm not going anywhere.""Amid rumours that the Tories might pull off a dramatic by-election gain, there was mounting anticipation in the Whitehaven sports centre hosting the count,  Unusually, election officials stopped ballot papers piling up in the trays carrying names for each candidate, meaning the final result was harder to predict. The resulting cheer from blue-rosetted activists in the hall might have been heard all the way in Downing Street.  This is a significant political moment for Theresa May - the first time in decades a sitting government has ousted an opposition party from one of its seats in a by-election.But the real fallout will be for Jeremy Corbyn, who has promised to reconnect with voters. He may be left trying to do so while facing further opposition from his own MPs.UKIP chairman Paul Oakden said:  ""The whole narrative of Paul's leadership depends on winning in Stoke is a nonsense."" Labour MP Jack Dromey, who ran Mr Snell's campaign, said: ""I think as we win we need necessary humility because there is a view that Labour is no longer listening in the way it should do.""I think what we have done in this community is precisely to do that.  ""Are we yet a credible alternative government? No we're not. But tonight is a decisive moment.""

This included the highest level ever recorded of Romanians and Bulgarians - 74,000. Some 323,000 people are thought to have left the UK in the year to September, up by 26,000 on the 12 months to September 2015.Of these, 128,000 were British citizens, along with 103,000 EU citizens and 93,000 non-EU citizens.Net migration is down. But while the net decrease looks substantial, nobody can say for sure what's triggered the change because these quarterly figures could have been influenced by a string of short-term factors.For a start, there appears to have been a rise in emigration - and when that goes up, net migration can come down.Secondly, some of the change could be down to seasonal fluctuations in student numbers.Thirdly, although there were significant departures by people from some parts of Eastern Europe, the number coming from poorer Romania and Bulgaria went up. The upshot is the overall number of people arriving for a job is broadly the same. What does it all amount to? Immigration statistics are an inexact science - and at the moment it's very difficult to know for sure what's going on.The figures are the first to include migration estimates following the EU referendum in June.Nicola White, head of international migration statistics at the ONS, said it was ""too early"" to say what effect the referendum has had on long-term migration.Home Secretary Amber Rudd accepted the government was still far from reaching its net migration target, but said the figures demonstrated ""we can reduce immigration where we can control it"".She denied a rise in people going back to countries such as Poland reflected an uncertainty among EU citizens living in the UK over their futures.Ms Rudd said: ""At the moment we have open immigration with the EU members, freedom of movement, so they can come and go as they want.""I don't see any particularly significant change within EU migration. The real change will be when we leave the EU, and then we will be able to make the choices ourselves what level of immigration we want to have.""And she said that Britain remained open to EU citizens already living here and contributing to the economy, saying: ""Let's not be in any doubt that the UK will always be a welcoming place for people who want to come here, work here and contribute to our economy.""Sunder Katwala, director of the think-tank British Future, said the figures showed the immigration debate will ""have to move on"" in the light of Brexit.He said: ""A one-size-fits-all approach to immigration can't help us make the post-Brexit choices that the government and the public now face.""Meanwhile, separate figures from the Home Office show that a near-record number of EU nationals were granted British citizenship last year.Citizenship was given to 16,754 people from EU countries, the second highest since records were first compiled, behind the 17,645 in 2013.Some 6,498 members of the EU 14 countries - older member states such as France, Spain and Germany - were granted UK citizenship in 2016, up 50% on the previous 12 months and the highest ever for a single year.A further 6,813 people from the EU 8 countries, which include Poland, gained British citizenship, a rise of 18%, surpassed only by figures for 2013.Citizenship was given to 3,215 Romanians and Bulgarians, up 20% on 2015 and again only topped by 2013 figures.Other points within the ONS statistics were:"

""I resent the idea, at the present, that one life is worth more than another - it's not,"" Mr Shannon said. Meanwhile, the Republic of Ireland's minister for foreign affairs, Charlie Flanagan, has said prosecutions must be ""vigorously pursued"" in all unlawful troubles related deaths, regardless of the perpetrator.  Speaking at an event organised by Relatives for Justice on Thursday evening, Mr Flanagan said: ""Regardless of who someone was and regardless of what they were doing, there is a requirement to effectively and meticulously investigate their death. ""It is not for governments to say to the bereaved that their loss or suffering is of greater or lesser worth than that or their neighbour or even their adversary.""Mr Flanagan said ""the process is not about seeking to find an artificial balance or equivalence but about ensuring that we have a comprehensive approach. That means looking at all Troubles related deaths regardless of who the perpetrator was.""Mr Flanagan added that ""there can be no hierarchy of victims"". ""The Stormont House institutions set out a comprehensive, inclusive approach to dealing with our troubled past which also meets the obligations on State Parties - including the British and Irish governments - under the European Convention on Human Rights,"" he said. SDLP MP Margaret Ritchie said inquiries ""must be balanced and fair"" and that the processes ""must be set by victims and survivors, with truth and accountability at its very core"". She said that ""no one is or should be above the rule of law"".Ulster Unionist MP Danny Kinahan said there is a moral duty to look after service personnel. The South Antrim MP said: ""Unfortunately, too often, our troops have faced baseless accusations and have been dragged through the courts unnecessarily.""""No one is above the law regardless of whether they are in a uniform or not,"" he added.Ms Ritchie acknowledged that inquests and prosecutions can look disproportionate, but they are only ""part of what we are doing"" and everyone should face justice. Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire spoke in favour of reforming legacy tribunals in Northern Ireland. The police and armed forces cannot ""act above [the law] or outside it"", he said, but noted that the vast majority acted ""honestly and with bravery"".He said that where soldiers face legal action, the government will supply counsel and ""taxpayer-funded legal support will be provided"" for as long as necessary. He said, however, that in the case of Northern Ireland, the legacy cases have favoured those against the state. He said that the system in Northern Ireland is not ""delivering for anyone"", and promised - in line with the Conservative manifesto - to reform the legacy tribunals and fully implement the Stormont House Agreement. He described those who use the courts to make money off legacy cases as ""appalling"",DUP MP Ian Paisley said the Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland, Barra McGrory, should remove himself from any involvement in legacy cases involving former members of the security forces because of a ""perceived conflict of interest"".Conservative Sir Gerald Howarth accused Mr McGrory of issuing ""a fatwa"" to the media to suppress criticism of his treatment of veterans.In a statement, a spokesperson for the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) said it was ""aware of the debate and the breadth of political opinion expressed in the House of Commons"" on Thursday. ""The PPS is wholly independent and, as the secretary of state has outlined, 'it is wrong to suggest that the PPS is applying itself to one side',"" it added.""There is no reason for a perception that the PPS does anything other  than apply the law as it currently stands in Northern Ireland and does so without fear, favour or prejudice. ""All of our decisions are taken in full compliance with the PPS Code for Prosecutors.""On Wednesday, Prime Minister Theresa May attacked those she claimed have made a business of dragging soldiers through the courts over incidents in Northern Ireland.She told MPs the government would ensure any Stormont investigative bodies have a legal duty to be fair, balanced and proportionate. Sinn Féin's Gerry Kelly said on Thursday that Mr Brokenshire's remarks in the House of Commons were ""an attempt by the British establishment to grant immunity to state forces involved in the conflict"".""Today James Brokenshire repeated the crass comments of British prime minister Theresa May that it is 'appalling when people try to make a business of dragging our brave troops through the courts',"" Mr Kelly said.He added that Mr Brokenshire's remarks were ""dangerous and disgraceful""."

He was speaking after talks in Brussels with Irish Prime Minister (Taoiseach) Enda Kenny. The UK is expected to trigger the Brexit process next month.Border controls were removed under the 1998 Good Friday peace deal.But once the UK leaves the EU, the border - heavily policed during the Troubles in Northern Ireland - will become one of the EU's external borders. Last June a majority of voters in Northern Ireland and Scotland voted to remain in the EU, but the UK Leave campaign won overall because so many in England backed Brexit.""We want to have the Good Friday agreement not being put under risks, and we want land borders being as open as possible,"" Mr Juncker said. A veteran European Commission politician, France's Michel Barnier, will be the EU's chief negotiator on Brexit, and he attended the Juncker-Kenny talks on Thursday.The Commission and Irish government ""will work closely together during the whole process of the Brexit negotiations,"" Mr Juncker said.Mr Kenny said Dublin was very concerned by the implications of Brexit and wanted ""the closest possible relationship between the UK and the EU"".""There should not be a return to a hard border and there won't be,"" AFP news agency quoted him as saying.

2017-02-23,Schools funding system 'must be fairer',https://web.archive.org//web/20170224053928/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-39052723,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe key group pushing for a fairer funding system in England's schools says government plans for a funding shake-up need to be rethought.The F40 group, which campaigned for 20 years for the funding overhaul, is warning that some poorly funded areas, and schools within them, will lose out.Its vice-chair, Cheltenham MP Alex Chalk, says it is important ""one injustice isn't replaced with another"".The government says it is not cutting funds in low income areas.Instead it plans to end unequal funding across the country.Education Secretary Justine Greening has highlighted how a school in Barnsley could receive 50% less than a school facing similar challenges in Hackney, east London.This is because of extra funds having been directed in the past to areas of higher deprivation and need. But many argue this is based on historical levels of need which are now out of date.The cross-party F40 group represents 41 local authority members with historically low education funding.Supported by MPs, councillors, education directors, heads, teachers and parents, it has long argued that the existing funding model is outdated, has no rationale and is unfair.It has highlighted how pupils on different sides of a council boundary can attract very different levels of funding. Ministers agreed the existing system was outdated and unjustifiable and, after a series of delays, the government published a final consultation on the proposals in December 2016.The plans are set to be implemented in 2018-19.F40 chairman Ivan Ould, a Leicestershire County Council member, said: ""The proposed funding formula indicates a total gain of £183m for F40 member authorities once the national formula is fully implemented from 2019-20.""But that has to be tempered by an outcome that none of us really anticipated: that some poorly funded authorities will not gain, and that many schools, both primary and secondary, within poorly funded authorities will actually lose out.""Earlier this week, the group lobbied MPs, many of whom are alarmed that so many schools in their areas are losers.The group argues:The Department for Education said school funding was at record levels but said the system for distributing it was unfair, opaque and outdated. And it claims f40 authorities will actually gain £210m rather than than the £183m the group has alluded to.A spokesman said: ""We are going to end the historic postcode lottery in school funding and under the proposed national schools funding formula, more than half of England's schools will receive a cash boost.""Funding every child fairly and according to their needs is at the heart of delivering the government's pledge to build a country that works for everyone. ""We recognise that schools are facing cost pressures, which is why we will continue to provide support to help them use their funding in cost effective ways, including improving the way they buy goods and services, so‎ they get the best possible value.""A spokesman added that it wanted to hear from as many schools, governors, local authorities and parents as possible in its consultation which runs until 22 March.

2017-02-23,'Magical thinking' on Heathrow expansion,https://web.archive.org//web/20170224053928/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-39053172,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkHeathrow expansion can only be justified if the government proves it will not breach laws on climate change and pollution, MPs say.Ministers say a third runway will not exceed environment limits.However, the Commons Environmental Audit Committee has accused the government of ""magical thinking"" - wishing the problem away without a proper solution.They say ministers must show the expansion will not fuel climate change.Committee chair Mary Creagh told BBC News: ""There's plenty of talk about how the government wants to solve environmental problems at Heathrow, but a total absence of any policy guarantees.""The implication of this is that they think other sectors of the economy like energy and industry are going to have to cut their carbon emissions even more so people can fly more - but the government's been told by its own advisors (the Committee on Climate Change) that's not possible.""The MPs also criticised the government's reliance on a projected increase in electric vehicles on the roads to keep local air pollution within safe limits.""The government has missed already its targets for electric vehicles,"" Ms Creagh said. ""Our committee has no confidence it will meet its target for 2020 or 2030. Ministers have got to put proper policies in place instead of relying on magical thinking."" What are your solutions for air pollution?The committee previously urged a step change in the way the government tackles environmental issues at Heathrow, but says there is little evidence this has happened.The UK has already breached EU limits in London for the pollutant NO2 for 2017. The committee says a new air quality strategy is urgently needed to ensure that airport expansion does not harm public health. The government has said after Brexit that EU environmental laws will be imported wholesale into the UK, but the MPs say they have seen no guarantees that the government will keep pace with future EU air quality laws.The report calls on the ministers to implement an alert system for nearby residents who are especially vulnerable to short-term exposure to air pollution.On climate change, the MPs complain that international aviation emissions from an expanded Heathrow will be 15% higher than the level previously set for 2028-32. They say the government must show how the slack will be taken up by other sectors of the economy, which are already struggling to meet their own emissions targets.They say measures on noise lack ambition, with no precision on the timing of a night flight ban and little evidence that predictable respite can be achieved. The report was welcomed by John Stewart, the chair of HACAN, the campaign group that opposes Heathrow expansion.""The government and Heathrow Airport have got to up their game big-time if they are to have any chance of getting a third runway,"" he said.  ""They have got to prove they can deliver on noise, climate and air pollution - not just say they can.""The report comes just weeks after the government launched a public consultation on a third runway, which ends on 25 May. Later this year or early next year MPs are expected to be asked to vote on the runway. A Department for Transport spokesman said: ""We take our air quality commitments extremely seriously and have been very clear that the new runway will not get the go-ahead unless air quality requirements can be met.""The spokesman said the government has no plans to ""water down"" its ambitions on cutting aviation emissions and remains committed to meeting emission reductions targets under the Climate Change Act.

The rate change is due to happen on 1 April.Businesses pay tax based on the rateable value of their property, including pubs, restaurants, warehouses, factories, shops and offices - and these values are being reassessed for the first time since 2010, meaning changes to the amount many firms will pay.In the face of opposition from business groups and some Conservative MPs, the government has defended the reforms and said 2017-18 ""will see the biggest ever cut in business rates"" and ""three-quarters of all businesses, right across the country, will see their rates either fall or stay the same"".But Mr Javid told the House of Commons he was ""acutely aware"" of problems for some others, saying: ""There are clearly some individual businesses facing particular difficulties.""He added: ""I have always listened to businesses and this situation is no exception. It's clear to me that more needs to be done to level the playing field and make the system fairer.""Mr Javid promised help for those ""facing the steepest increases"".He added that he and Chancellor Philip Hammond were looking at ""how best"" to proceed, telling MPs: ""We expect to be in a position to make an announcement at the time of the Budget in just two weeks' time.""At Prime Minister's Questions earlier, Theresa May was asked about the changes by Green Party MP Caroline Lucas, who said the changes would ""devastate"" the economy in her Brighton Pavilion constituency.The prime minister said it was ""right"" for rates to change to reflect changing property prices, saying the system was underpinned by fairness.She added: ""We also, though, want to support businesses and recognise that, for some, business rates will go up when these revaluations take place.""Mrs May also said there was ""significant funding in place for transitional relief"". For Labour, shadow communities secretary Gareth Thomas said there was a business rates ""crisis"", saying it had taken Mr Javid ""apparently until now to grasp its seriousness"".Asked whether the government was in ""chaos"" over business rates, the prime minister's spokesman said: ""I don't think it is chaos. We've set out our plans to provide a transitional relief fund to make sure that those affected by the rise in business rates have a smooth transition.""He later added: ""The PM was absolutely clear today that there is a transitional fund already in place - and that she has asked the chancellor and the communities secretary to make sure that this is being spent appropriately. ""She also asked them to work to ensure that there was appropriate relief in place for the hardest cases. ""Sajid echoed this exact statement this afternoon - and made clear that we will come back to this issue at Budget. We would never confirm or deny what would be in the Budget this far in advance.""The chairman of the Treasury Select Committee, Conservative MP Andrew Tyrie, has written to the chancellor to ask for ""the facts"" about the changes.He said there were ""several problems"" with the proposals, citing ""considerable concern"" about the impact on smaller firms.The Federation of Small Businesses said it welcomed the PM's ""intervention"" to tackle what it called an ""extremely worrying situation for many small businesses""."

But children's welfare must be promoted in immigration decisions, judges said.As of 2012, Britons must earn more than £18,600 ($23,140) before a husband or wife from outside the European Economic Area (EEA) can settle in the UK.Judges rejected an appeal by families who argued that the rules breached their human right to a family life. Seven Supreme Court justices hearing the case said the minimum income requirement was ""acceptable in principle"". But they criticised the rules around it, saying they failed to take ""proper account"" of the duty to safeguard and promote the welfare of children when making decisions which affect them. And they ruled there should be an amendment to allow alternative sources of funding, other than a salary or benefits, to be considered in a claim. The rules were introduced by the former coalition government to stop foreign spouses becoming reliant on taxpayers.The minimum income threshold, which also affects people settled in the UK as refugees, rises to £22,400 ($27,870) if the couple have a child who does not have British citizenship - and then by an additional £2,400 ($2,986) for each subsequent child.The markers replaced a previous, more general, requirement to show the Home Office that the incoming partner would not be a drain on public resources and that the couple or family could adequately support themselves. They do not take into account the earnings of the overseas partner - even if they have higher qualifications, or are likely to be employed in higher-paid work than their British spouse. And the threshold does not apply to spouses from within the EEA.Visa rules ""creating price on love""""Just because she happens to fall in love with me and I have the wrong passport, she isn't allowed to live with me in her own country,"" says Spencer Russ, an American who may be deported from the UK, where he lives with his British wife, Laura Segan.Read more about families split by the rulesDelivering their judgement, the justices said the government's rules had the ""legitimate"" aim of ensuring ""that the couple do not have recourse to benefits and have sufficient resources to play a full part in British life"".But they said the rules fail because they do not treat ""the best interests of children as a primary consideration"".By BBC Home Affairs correspondent, Dominic CascianiWhile the couples in this case have won their appeals it's not much of a victory when the Supreme Court has clearly ruled the system is compatible with human rights. Campaigners say they are delighted. But the government now knows the principle of the policy has been endorsed by the highest court in the land as a legitimate way to control immigration. So what does that mean in practical terms? The Home Office will need to make sure that each decision takes into account the rights of children - and whether a couple have other assets -  perhaps a home, savings or substantial financial support from family. That will benefit some of the families - but it also means that in the long run some of the most affected people from poorer Asian communities may still be unable to get permission to bring their husband or wife to Britain. The justices heard appeals in February 2016 from a series of test cases. Two claimants, Abdul Majid and Shabana Javed, are British citizens who have partners who are Pakistani nationals. The third is a Lebanese refugee who cannot find suitable work in the UK despite his postgraduate qualifications. He says his similarly-qualified wife has high earning potential and speaks fluent English. A final case concerns another recognised refugee from the Democratic Republic of Congo whose wife has been barred from settling. In their ruling on Wednesday, the panel, led by Supreme Court deputy president Lady Hale, held that the minimum income requirement (MIR) ""is acceptable in principle"", but that the rules and instructions ""unlawfully fail to take proper account"" of the Home Secretary's duty under the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 to have regard to the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of children when making decisions which affect them.The court ruled on the ""instructions also require amendment to allow consideration of alternative sources of funding when evaluating a claim"" under Article 8 (right to private and family life) of the European Convention on Human Rights.Satbir Singh is a British citizen who is unable to bring his wife to the UK from India, because his more than £60,000 a year income comes from more than one source. He said the vast majority of those affected ""won't get any respite from this ruling, don't have the resources to visit each other, who might have children who are growing up without parents"".   ""It's terribly frustrating to find that very important components of the quality of your life are dictated by a very heartlessly thought out set of rules which seem targeted at nothing apart from achieving a certain set of numbers that the government has set for itself,"" he said. A Home Office spokesman said the court had endorsed its approach in setting an income threshold for family migration that prevents burdens on the taxpayer and ensures migrant families can integrate into our communities.""This is central to building an immigration system that works in the national interest,"" they said.The current rules remained in force, they said, ""but we are carefully considering what the court has said in relation to exceptional cases where the income threshold has not been met, particularly where the case involves a child"".Saira Grant, chief executive at campaigning charity the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, also welcomed the ruling - as a ""real victory for families"". She said the rules had been ""tearing families apart and significantly harming children"".The ruling on considering alternative funding sources was ""a significant victory"" and the government must now ""take immediate steps to protect the welfare of children in accordance with their legal duty""."

Twelve points should be the ceiling.""Sheena Jowett, deputy chairman of the Magistrates' Association, the independent charity representing magistrates in England and Wales, said: ""Magistrates take decisions under clear guidelines, impartially, and on the merits of each individual case. ""Automatic disqualification can be avoided or reduced in cases of 'exceptional hardship'. The process is a robust one and the concept of hardship must be proved to an exceptional level.""

2017-02-23,UK bomber's family deny he received £1m,https://web.archive.org//web/20170224053928/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-39057807,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe family of a British IS fighter who carried out a suicide attack in Iraq deny he received £1m in compensation after being freed from Guantanamo Bay.It has been reported by the Daily Mail that Jamal al-Harith received the payout from the UK government after being freed from captivity in 2004.The family say that figure was ""a group settlement including costs for four innocent people including Jamal"". The Daily Mail says it stands by its story.Al-Harith, who was 50 and from Manchester, was originally known as Ronald Fiddler.He took the name Jamal al-Harith when he converted to Islam, but was known most recently by the nom-de-guerre Abu-Zakariya al-Britani, given to him by so-called Islamic State.Who are Britain’s jihadists?Al-Harith was handed over to American forces in Afghanistan in early 2002, before being sent to Guantanamo Bay - a US prison in Cuba for terrorist suspects.US interrogators found he provided useful information about the Taliban's methods, and he was released after two years. He later joined IS and blew himself up at an Iraqi army base in Mosul this week.Analysis, by Frank Gardner, BBC security correspondentIn the light of how he chose to end his life, the case of Jamal al-Harith is certainly embarrassing for those in government in 2004 and 2010, and for those whose job it was to assess the security threat he posed between 2004 and 2014. But his lawyer has told me that when al-Harith returned from his two years' imprisonment in Guantanamo Bay in March 2004, he had already been so extensively questioned that his interview with British special branch officers lasted just 20 minutes before charges were dropped and he was released. He was assessed - correctly at the time - of being a low security risk to the British population and he spent the next 10 years living openly in and around Manchester with his young family, showing no signs of violent extremism. At some stage, probably around 2013, he became sufficiently radicalised, or even re-radicalised, to go off to Syria to join IS. It was this that MI5 failed to pick up.In a statement, al-Harith's family said they wished ""to express their sorrow and distress at the news of his death"", but were ""concerned about the distorted and over-simplified reports they have seen in the news"". ""The Jamal they knew up until 2001 when he was taken to Guantanamo Bay would not have become involved with a despicable organisation such as so-called Islamic State. He was a peaceful and gentle person,"" it continued.""Whatever he may or may not have done since then they believe from their own experience he was utterly changed by the physical and mental cruelty and the inhuman treatment he endured for two years at Guantanamo."" His relatives insisted he did not receive £1m in compensation, adding: ""The family last heard from him in 2014 and have since then been desperately worried about his fate.""Leon Jameson, al-Harith's older brother, says they last spoke two years ago on the phone, before he went to Syria.Mr Jameson described his sibling as ""fun"" when he was growing up and ""always helping other people"". When asked about his brother's suicide bombing he said: ""I can't actually commend him about it because it isn't right, but he's done it. It's something he believes in, so I'll leave that with him.""He did what he could for other people, which is what he used to always be like.  And he said ""it had been a struggle"" for his brother ever since Guantanamo Bay. ""If he didn't even listen to his wife, none of us could have really changed his mind.""Former Prime Minister Tony Blair released a statement accusing the Daily Mail of ""utter hypocrisy"" after it ran a story about al-Harith on Wednesday headlined: ""Still Think He Wasn't A Danger, Mr Blair? Fury at Labour government's £1m compensation for innocent Brit"".Mr Blair said the man's release in 2004 had ""followed a Parliamentary and massive media campaign led by the Daily Mail... and strongly supported by the then Conservative Opposition"". The former PM continued: ""He was not paid compensation by my government. The compensation was agreed in 2010 by the [coalition] government...""In response, the paper issued a statement saying Mr Blair was ""utterly wrong to accuse the Daily Mail newspaper of inaccuracy over the Ronald Fiddler story"".""However, our sister organisation MailOnline, which is an independently edited website, did publish a misleading headline which said that Mr Blair's government was responsible for the £1m payout to Fiddler.  ""This ran briefly and has since been removed and corrected. MailOnline apologises for this mistake.""It added: ""The fact remains that the actions which led to this payment were all the responsibility of Tony Blair."""

2017-02-23,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20170224053928/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThis article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide to the UK's vote to leave the European Union. It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 52% to 48%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who resigned on the day after losing the referendum. Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she says she will respect the will of the people. She has said ""Brexit means Brexit"" but there is still a lot of debate about what that will mean in practice especially on the two key issues of how British firms do business in the European Union and what curbs are brought in on the rights of European Union nationals to live and work in the UK. She set out more details of her negotiating hopes in her key speech on Brexit.The UK economy appears to have weathered the initial shock of the Brexit vote, although the value of the pound remains near a 30-year low, but opinion is sharply divided over the long-term effects of leaving the EU. Some major firms such as Easyjet and John Lewis have pointed out that the slump in sterling has increased their costs. Britain also lost its top AAA credit rating, meaning the cost of government borrowing will be higher. But share prices have recovered from a dramatic slump in value, with both the FTSE 100 and the broader FTSE 250 index, which includes more British-based businesses, trading higher than before the referendum. The Bank of England cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - a record low and the first cut since 2009 - after the vote and there has not been the economic slump or recession that some had predicted. The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it has to invoke an agreement called Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May has said she intends to trigger this process by the end of March 2017, meaning the UK will be expected to have left by the summer of 2019, depending on the precise timetable agreed during the negotiations. The government will also enact a Great Repeal Bill which will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. It is expected to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove.After a court battle, the UK's Supreme Court ruled in January that Parliament must be consulted before Article 50 is invoked. This is why a two line Brexit bill is currently making its way through Parliament. MPs have approved it after Labour MPs were told to support it. It has got through its first House of Lords debate with debate and votes on possible changes expected in the next week.Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These men - dubbed the Three Brexiteers - will play a central role in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although it will be Mrs May, as prime minister, who will have the final say. David Cameron's government did not do any emergency planning for Brexit ahead of the referendum and Mrs May has rejected calls to say what her negotiating goals are.Once Article 50 has been triggered, the UK will have two years to negotiate its withdrawal. But no one really knows how the Brexit process will work - Article 50 was only created in late 2009 and it has never been used. Former Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, now Chancellor, wanted Britain to remain in the EU, and he has suggested it could take up to six years for the UK to complete exit negotiations. The terms of Britain's exit will have to be agreed by 27 national parliaments, a process which could take some years, he has argued. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. The UK will continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making.Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Following Theresa May's Brexit recent speech we now know that the UK is not intending to stay in the EU's single market. Although there has been speculation for months about the issue, it would have meant the UK staying under the auspices of the European Court of Justice and having to allow unlimited EU immigration, under freedom of movement rules.Both sides want trade to continue after Brexit with the UK seeking a positive outcome for those who wish to trade goods and services"" - such as those in the City of London and wanting a ""comprehensive free trade deal"" giving the UK ""the greatest possible access"" to the single market. Mrs May says she wants the UK to reach a new customs union deal with the EU. A customs union is where countries agree not to impose tariffs on each others' goods and have a common tariff on goods coming in from elsewhere. The UK is currently part of the EU customs union but that stops the UK being able to do its own trade deals with other countries. Reality Check: How could customs union work?These terms have increasingly been used as debate focused on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people in order to maintain access to the EU single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result.The government has declined to give a firm guarantee about the status of EU nationals currently living in the UK, saying this is not possible without a reciprocal pledge from other EU members about the millions of British nationals living on the continent. EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, will be be able to stay, the chief civil servant at the Home Office has said. The rights of other EU nationals would be subject to negotiations on Brexit and the ""will of Parliament"", he added.A lot depends on the kind of deal the UK agrees with the EU. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions on EU nationals, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.Again, it depends on whether the UK government decides to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages. Citizens' Advice has reminded people their rights have not changed yet and asked anyone to contact them if they think they have been discriminated against following the Leave vote.Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested EU migrants who come to the UK as Brexit nears may not be given the right to stay. He has said there might have to be a cut-off point if there was a ""surge"" in new arrivals.People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote. The day-to-day spending impact is likely to be more significant. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it to remain at least 10% below where it was on 23 June, in the long term. This means imported goods will consequently get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have already been seen and the issue was most notably illustrated by the dispute between Tesco and Marmite's makers about whether prices would be put up or not in the stores.The latest UK inflation figures, for January, showed the CPI inflation rate rising to 1.8%, its highest level for two and a half years, with signs of more cost pressures set to feed through in the months to come.Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration.She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations. As mentioned above, the key issue is whether other EU nations will grant the UK access to the single market, if that is what it wants, while at the same time being allowed to restrict the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK.Mrs May has said she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. It is currently running at 330,000 a year, of which 184,000 are EU citizens, and 188,000 are from outside the EU - the figures include a 39,000 outflow of UK citizens.It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Liberal Democrats - who have just a handful of MPs - have vowed to halt Brexit and keep Britain in the EU if they were to win the next general election.Some commentators, including former House of Commons clerk Lord Lisvane, have argued that a further referendum would be needed to ratify whatever deal the UK hammers out with the EU, but there are few signs political leaders view this as a viable option.Yes. Theresa May has appeared keen to avoid a vote on her negotiating stance, to avoid having to give away her priorities, but Theresa May has said there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. It is worth mentioning that any deal also has to be agreed by the European Parliament - with British MEPs getting a chance to vote on it there.  While there could be limitations on British nationals' ability to live and work in EU countries, it seems unlikely they would want to deter tourists. There are many countries outside the European Economic Area, which includes the 28 EU nations plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway, that British citizens can visit for up to 90 days without needing a visa and it is possible that such arrangements could be negotiated with European countries.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. In theory, the government could, if it wanted, decide to change the colour, which is currently standardised for EU countries, says the BBC's Europe correspondent, Chris Morris.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketNo nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it is ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faces being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. A second independence referendum for the country is now ""highly likely"", she has said, although not in 2017. She has said she wants Scotland to stay in the single market and said Mrs May's decision to rule out the UK staying in the single market ""undoubtedly"" brings the referendum closer.Before his resignation Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said the impact in Northern Ireland would be ""very profound"" and that the whole island of Ireland should now be able to vote on reunification. But, speaking while she was still Northern Ireland Secretary, Theresa Villiers ruled out the call from Sinn Féin for a border poll, saying the circumstances in which one would be called did not exist. The land border is likely to be a key part of the Brexit talks. Theresa May said a priority for her would be negotiating a deal with the EU which allowed a common travel area between the UK and the Republic of Ireland.During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest. But his successor Theresa May has said she will keep it in place, at least for the current Parliament, which is due to last until 2020.So far there has been a cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. There are yet to be signs that rising inflation have worried the Bank of England  enough to consider raising interest rates.  But if that happened it would make mortgages and loans more expensive to repay - but would be good news for savers.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.Eurotunnel boss Jacques Gounon said last November the reintroduction of duty-free would be ""an incredible boost for my business"" but he later said  that remark had been ""light-hearted"". Erik Juul-Mortensen, president of the Tax Free World Association (TFWA) said after the referendum vote ""it is not possible to predict how Brexit will affect the duty free and travel retail industry, and it is wiser not to make assumptions about exactly what the impact will be.""  They are at the moment but no-one knows the longer term prospects for definite. The EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - is not an EU initiative. It was negotiated between countries within a group known as the European Economic Area, often simply referred to as the single market (plus Switzerland, which confusingly is not a member of the EEA, but has agreed access to the single market). Therefore, the future of Britons' EHIC cover could depend on whether the UK decided to sever ties with the EEA.Probably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report. In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two-thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.However, the UK government is committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, the UK government is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR. However, the EU has its own European Court of Justice, whose decisions are binding on EU institutions and member states.Its rulings have sometimes caused controversy in Britain and supporters of a Brexit have called for immediate legislation to curb its powers. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also cited sovereignty and democracy, and they wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Four of the biggest US banks have committed to helping maintain the City's position. But HSBC will move up to 1,000 jobs to Paris, the BBC understands. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Pest control firm Rentokil Initial says it could make £15m extra this year thanks to a weaker currency.Others are less optimistic. Hilary Jones, a director at UK cosmetics firm Lush said the company was ""terrified"" about the economic impact. She added that while the firm's Dorset factory would continue to produce goods for the UK market, products for the European market may be made at its new plant in Germany.Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After the Leave vote, the government will probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""As with most elements of the UK economy, not enough solid data has been published yet to accurately conclude the Brexit effect on house prices. Industry figures have pointed to ""uncertainty"" among buyers and sellers that could potentially change the housing market.So far, the most significant research has come from the respected Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which has published the conclusions of a survey of its members. This primarily records sentiment among surveyors.It found that house prices are expected to fall across the UK in the three months after the referendum vote. However, the dip in prices is only expected to persist over the 12 months from June in London and East Anglia, surveyors predict.House prices were already slowing in central London, owing to the fall-out from changes to stamp duty rules in April.Separate figures from property portal Rightmove suggested the average asking price of houses coming on to the market in England and Wales fell by 0.9%, or £2,647, in July compared with June. It said that agents had reported very few sales had fallen through as a result of the vote.Many potential first-time buyers would welcome a fall in house prices, with ownership among the young falling owing to affordability concerns. Investors in property, or those who have paid off a mortgage and hope to leave homes as inheritance would be unhappy with a long-term reduction in value.  Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law following the decision to leave the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" will not necessarily disappear overnight - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU means the UK will not be part of TTIP. It will have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Former Labour health secretary Lord Owen has said that because of TTIP (see answer above) the only way to protect the NHS from further privatisation was to get out of the EU."

2017-02-23,Who's Who: Theresa May's cabinet,https://web.archive.org//web/20170224053928/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36785814,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkTheresa May is forming her new government after becoming Conservative prime minister. She is continuing to announce her full cabinet - but here's what we know so far. The list will be updated as new appointments are made. Campaigned to Remain in the European Union The former home secretary, 59, becomes the UK's second female prime minister in the wake of David Cameron's resignation after the EU referendum. She had previously served in the Home Office for more than six years. Theresa May: Full profileHow does May's cabinet compare to Cameron's?Campaigned to Leave the EUBoris Johnson succeeds Philip Hammond at the Foreign Office. The former London mayor headed the campaign for the UK to leave the European Union. He did not previously have a ministerial appointment in Mr Cameron's government but accepted an invitation to attend political cabinet. He was not running any department. Mr Johnson, 52, may be one of the best known politicians in the country but the move to foreign secretary is a big step up from his previous role.Read how the world has reacted.Leave campaignerDavid Davis has been appointed to the new cabinet position of secretary of state for exiting the European Union - or ""Brexit secretary"". A veteran Eurosceptic, he has previously held the positions of Conservative party chairman and shadow deputy prime minister. Between 2003 and 2008, he was the shadow home secretary under both Michael Howard and David Cameron. Mr Davis, 67, lost to David Cameron in the 2005 Tory leadership contest. Details about the new Brexit department are still emerging, but it is likely to take the lead in negotiating Britain's departure from the EU and unpicking the thousands of pages of EU rules written into UK law.Theresa May is reported to have ordered civil servants to find a building for the new department.Leave campaignerLiam Fox, 54, has taken on another newly created position as secretary of state for international trade. He was made secretary of state for defence in 2010 but resigned in 2011 over allegations he had given a close friend, lobbyist Adam Werritty, access to the Ministry of Defence and allowed him to join official trips overseas.Like Mr Davis he is a Eurosceptic who voted to leave the EU and he also stood unsuccessfully for the Conservative Party leadership in 2005.He stood again in the latest race to be leader but was eliminated in the first ballot after winning the support of just 16 MPs.Remain campaignerThe appointment to chief whip is a big step up for Gavin Williamson, according to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg.David Cameron's former parliamentary private secretary, he also served as parliamentary private secretary to transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin.The 40-year-old from North Yorkshire was elected MP for South Staffordshire in 2010. As chief whip, he will attend Cabinet meetings.Remain campaignerKaren Bradley takes over from the deposed John Whittingdale as Culture, Media and Sport Secretary. She had been working with Theresa May as a Home Office minister since 2014.She was first elected MP for Staffordshire Moorlands in May 2010.Her appointment comes two months after Mr Whittingdale and the BBC agreed a major overhaul of the corporation.Read more about her appointment here.Leave campaignerAndrea Leadsom, the Conservative leadership candidate who dramatically pulled out of the race, is the new Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Secretary.The prominent Brexit backer is promoted from energy minister to a cabinet role which will see her take responsibility for a farming industry as it faces the end of European Union subsidies. She will also have to fashion a post-Brexit fisheries policy. Green campaigners will be watching carefully to see what happens to environment regulations in areas including wildlife habitats, air pollution and water quality, currently governed by rules from Europe. Mrs Leadsom's public reason for withdrawing from the leadership race was to allow a rapid transition at the top, and give the economy certainty in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. But our political editor Laura Kuenssberg says her friends were saying she was alarmed by the level of scrutiny given to her comments on motherhood reported in the Times.Read more on Mrs Leadsom's motivations for stepping aside here.Baroness Evans of Bowes Park becomes leader of the House of Lords at 40, in her first ministerial role since being ennobled by David Cameron in 2014.She attended London's Henrietta Barnett School and Cambridge University before becoming deputy director of the Conservative research department, deputy director of the Policy Exchange think-tank and chief operating officer of the New Schools Network - the organisation which ran Michael Gove's free schools programme.Remain campaignerDamian Green is appointed the new Work and Pensions Secretary, taking over from Stephen Crabb, who earlier resigned.Mr Green served as an Immigration Minister and Justice Secretary in the coalition government but has been on the backbenches since 2014.Leave campaignerPriti Patel is the new International Development Secretary, a promotion from her role as employment minister which she's held for just a year.Ms Patel became MP for Witham in 2010 and joined the front bench as a Treasury minister in 2014.She is no stranger to controversy, having previously advocated bringing back the death penalty and was accused of ""divide and rule politics"" during the referendum campaign for claiming that ""biased"" immigration policy prevents curry chefs from outside the EU from working in the UK.On her appointment, she immediately faced calls to guarantee the UK's legal commitment to spending 0.7% of GDP on overseas aid.Remain campaignerGreg Clark is secretary of state of a newly-created ministry of business, energy and industrial strategy.His appointment spells the end for a department which put climate change at the top of the agenda.Just eight years after it was created by then-prime minister Gordon Brown, the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) is being merged into Mr Clark's new department and losing the ""climate change"" part of its name.Environmentalists immediately expressed concern that the reshaping of departments showed the government was downgrading climate change as a priority.But Richard Black, director of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU), said Mr Clark's move was ""an excellent appointment"", saying he ""understands climate change, and has written influential papers on the benefits of Britain developing a low-carbon economy"".Remain campaignerJames Brokenshire, who has been working with Theresa May at the Home Office - where he was immigration minister - has been made Northern Ireland Secretary.He takes over from Theresa Villiers, who resigned from the cabinet having been offered another role but saying it was not one ""which I felt I could take on"". Before entering parliament Mr Brokenshire was a partner at a large international law firm.From 2011 to 2015, he served as security minister at the Home Office with responsibility for domestic national security and counter terrorism. This included supporting the home secretary with oversight of the work of MI5 and the national police counter-terrorism network.His responsibilities also included the government's counter-terrorism strategy and he was part of the prime minister's ""extremism taskforce"". He also led negotiations with the Jordanian government to secure the deportation of the radical cleric Abu Qatada.Read more on his appointment here.Remain campaignerDavid Lidington, former Europe Minister, is promoted to Leader of the House. He had been Europe Minister since 2010 but moves across to a post involving the smooth running of the Commons. The Cambridge history graduate and father-of-four has been MP for Aylesbury since 1992. He previously worked for BP and mining firm Rio Tinto.Campaigned to Remain in the EUPhilip Hammond has been named chancellor of the exchequer. He was foreign secretary under David Cameron from 2014 to 2016, having previously served as defence secretary and transport secretary. He replaces George Osborne.Mr Hammond, 60, is seen at Westminster as the ultimate safe pair of hands. Sometimes mocked as ""box office Phil"" for what some see as his dull delivery, he forged a reputation in the shadow Treasury team as the Tories' public spending ""axeman"".He was seen as a Eurosceptic who spoke of withdrawal if the EU were not reformed, but was a Remain campaigner in the referendum. He now has the job of steering Britain's economy through the choppy post-Brexit waters.Read what Mr Hammond has to say on his first day in the job.Remain campaignerAmber Rudd has been made home secretary, filling the vacancy left by Mrs May. Ms Rudd was formerly energy and climate change secretary, a position she held for just one year.During the campaign for Remain in the EU referendum, she warned in a TV debate that she would not trust the new Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson to drive her home at the end of a night out.The former investment banker, venture capitalist, and financial journalist, aged 52, decided to enter politics in her 40s in order to get ""a grip on her life"". She quickly joined the fast track to the top after being elected to Parliament as MP for Hastings and Rye. She was seen as a protege of then Chancellor George Osborne, serving as his parliamentary private secretary before being promoted to junior minister at the Energy and Climate Change department in 2014. Remain campaignerLiz Truss moves from her role as secretary for environment, food and rural affairs to replace Michael Gove as justice secretary.A qualified management accountant, she became MP for South West Norfolk in 2010 and was appointed education minister in 2012.She was brought up in Yorkshire and attended Roundhay, a comprehensive school in Leeds, and went on to read philosophy, politics and economics at Merton College, Oxford.Socially liberal, the 40-year-old was a founder member of the free enterprise group of Conservative MPs arguing for more deregulation of the economy.Remain campaignerJustine Greening has said she is ""absolutely delighted"" to be made the new education secretary, taking over from Nicky Morgan. She was also appointed minister for women and equalities. Her new department will also take on higher and further education, skills and apprenticeships.Ms Greening leaves her international development secretary post, which she was promoted to in October 2011.MP for Putney since 2005, she became economic secretary to the Treasury after the 2010 election, succeeding Philip Hammond as transport secretary after he was promoted to defence secretary.At London's Pride day on 25 June, two days after the Brexit vote, the 47-year-old announced in a tweet she was in a same-sex relationship, saying ""I campaigned for Stronger In but sometimes you're better off out!"".Read more about what's awaiting Ms Greening at the education department.Leave campaignerChris Grayling, Theresa May's leadership campaign chief, has been appointed transport secretary. He was formerly Leader of the House.The most pressing jobs in his in-tray include dealing with the travel chaos caused by Southern Rail's disrupted services, the expansion of airport capacity in south-east England and high speed rail link, HS2.He's got some experience in this department, having served as shadow transport secretary from December 2005 to 2007.The Brexiteer had a surprisingly low-key, restrained referendum, largely refraining from ""blue-on-blue"" attacks. He was also one of the few Vote Leave spokesmen to share a platform with former UKIP leader Nigel Farage. Remain campaignerPatrick McLoughlin leaves his role as transport secretary to become Conservative Party chairman and chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.An MP since 1986, the former miner also served as chief whip, after being appointed to the role in David Cameron's first cabinet.As transport secretary, he was in charge of several large-scale projects including Crossrail and HS2. The 58-year-old said he was ""very pleased indeed"" with his new role.Remain campaignerSajid Javid is moved sideways from business secretary to secretary of the department for communities and local government.Mr Javid, considered a protege of former chancellor George Osborne's, held the culture secretary position before being appointed to the business role last year and is a former managing director of Deutsche Bank. The 46-year-old University of Exeter graduate stood on a ""joint ticket"" with Stephen Crabb for the leadership election, hoping to be chancellor if Mr Crabb had become PM.Remain campaignerMichael Fallon has kept his job at the Ministry of Defence - a position the 64-year-old has held since 2014.He was Conservative MP for Darlington from 1983 to 1992 - initially during Margaret Thatcher's time in Downing Street - and after leaving Parliament, he was later re-elected as MP for Sevenoaks in 1997.A former Conservative Party deputy chairman, he has previously served as energy and business minister, and before that secretary of state for business and enterprise.Seen as a safe pair of hands in Westminster, he described himself as a ""pretty reluctant Remainer"" after the EU referendum.Remain campaignerDespite earlier speculation, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt remains in his post.The 49-year-old was appointed culture secretary in David Cameron's first coalition government, a role he held for two years - including while London played host to the 2012 Olympic Games.He took over the health portfolio following a cabinet reshuffle in 2012, and described the appointment as the ""biggest privilege of my life"". Most recently, Mr Hunt has been locked in a battle with the British Medical Association over a new contract for junior doctors, which has led to a series of strikes.Remain campaignerDavid Mundell will continue as Secretary of State for Scotland.Mr Mundell, the only Scottish Conservative MP, said his focus was now on ""ensuring Scotland gets the best possible deal out of the EU negotiations"".Former prime minister David Cameron first appointed Mr Mundell to the post when he held his Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale seat for the third consecutive election in 2015.Remain campaignerMay's cabinet: Who's in and who's out? Alun Cairns, MP for the Vale of Glamorgan, remains in his cabinet role as secretary of state for Wales.He was appointed to the post just four months ago so there was little surprise that he will retain his position. The 45-year-old, who was born in Swansea and is a graduate of the University of Wales, Newport, was elected as MP for the Vale of Glamorgan in 2010. He worked in banking for a decade before his election to the Welsh Assembly. Remain campaignerGeorge Osborne has been fired as chancellor.He had been in the Treasury since 2010 - throughout David Cameron's tenure in Downing Street. He had also been first secretary of state since May 2015. A key ally of Mr Cameron, Mr Osborne tweeted it had been a ""privilege"" to be chancellor, adding: ""Others will judge - I hope I've left the economy in a better state than I found it.""Leave campaignerMichael Gove has been fired as justice secretary. The former Times journalist also served under David Cameron as education secretary in the coalition government, and as chief whip.He successfully campaigned for Brexit alongside Boris Johnson - but later withdrew his support for his colleague to be Conservative leader and prime minister, instead standing himself. He was eliminated in the final round of voting by MPs in third place.His surprise move to stand for the leadership and therefore to become prime minister effectively dashed Mr Johnson's hopes of running.Remain campaignerNicky Morgan is to leave her post as education secretary. The 43-year-old, who qualified as a lawyer, became an MP in 2010 and rose to the cabinet position of minister for women and equalities in 2013.London-born Ms Morgan replaced Michael Gove as education secretary in 2014. She reportedly considered standing in the Conservative leadership contest, but ultimately threw her support behind leave campaigner Mr Gove, despite campaigning for a Remain vote herself.In a tweet, she said she was ""disappointed"" not to be continuing her work in the education department, before congratulating her successor Justine Greening, saying she was ""committed to excellence in education"".Remain campaignerWork and Pensions Secretary Stephen Crabb has resigned from government ""in the best interests of my family"". He was one of the four contenders who lost out to Theresa May for the Conservative leadership.BBC political correspondent Vicki Young says it's not yet known whether Mr Crabb was offered a post he did not want or had just decided to resign from the government, possibly following some newspaper stories about his private life at the weekend. Read more about Mr Crabb here.Leave campaignerJohn Whittingdale has left his post as culture secretary. The Leave campaigner was vice-chairman of the influential group of Tory MPs called the 1922 Committee until he took over the portfolio for culture, media and sport after the general election in 2015 from Sajid Javid.In a tweet, he said it had been ""a privilege"" to serve as culture secretary, and wished his successor ""every success"".  Leave campaignerTheresa Villiers steps down as Northern Ireland secretary, saying she declined an offer of another role from the new prime minister.Former barrister Ms Villiers, MP for Chipping Barnet, had held the Northern Ireland portfolio since 2012. Prior to that, she was a Member of the European Parliament for six years.In December 2005, Mr Cameron promoted her to shadow chief secretary to the Treasury. In 2007, she was made a shadow transport minister, a brief she continued to hold when the coalition came to power.She was among prominent figures who campaigned for Brexit. She said Mrs May had been ""kind enough to offer me a role"" but added that it was ""not one which I felt I could take on"".Read more about Ms Villiers here.Remain campaignerOliver Letwin has been sacked from his role as Cabinet Office minister and chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.The long-time MP started his political career as a policy adviser to Margaret Thatcher's government. After becoming elected an MP in 1997 he went on to serve in high profile shadow cabinet posts under then Tory-leader Michael Howard, including shadow home secretary and shadow chancellor.A mainstay of the Cameron years, he served as minister for government policy under the coalition government, and continued as a cabinet member following the 2015 general election.However, the 60-year-old may be better known by some for throwing parliamentary papers into a public bin in St James's Park and apologising for comments he made about black people days after the 1985 Broadwater Farm riot in north London. Remain campaignerChief Whip Mark Harper leaves his post to make way for David Cameron's former parliamentary private secretary Gavin Williamson.In a tweet, the MP for the Forest of Dean, who held the chief whip post for one year, said: ""I have decided to leave the Government & return to the backbenches.

2017-02-23,France loves you,https://web.archive.org//web/20170224053928/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39049858,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkFor France's centrist presidential hopeful Emmanuel Macron this was the chance to engage close-up with thousands of expat voters.""French Londoners, France loves you,"" he told a rally, urging them to come home because their country needed their drive and expertise.He cited the frequently aired claim that London was France's sixth-largest city, with an estimated 200,000 French residents. In fact it would rank about 30th. But what drew Mr Macron to the UK was perhaps not so much the number as the type of French people living in its capital. Many are young, educated, upwardly and geographically mobile - exactly the constituency he has galvanised at home.Opinion polls suggest he has a chance of reaching the second-round presidential run-off in May and could even win the presidency.Queuing to hear him speak in Westminster on Tuesday was Elise Siouve, 25, a biotechnology postgraduate at Cambridge University, who felt Mr Macron ""understands the need to adapt to social and economic changes"".Another Cambridge student, Benjamin Vendrand-Maillet, 24, has set up a unit of Macron supporters at the university. For him, the centrist's market-friendly policies would work ""for all French people, whether rich or poor, young or old"" and he was best placed to defeat the populist Front National. The main challenge for French candidates campaigning abroad is that turnout is low among expats. In the UK, it is typically about 30%. Why bother to vote when you have decided to make another country your home?But Mr Macron could benefit from the UK's vote to leave the EU, which he deeply regrets. French residents who may suddenly be unsure of their long-term status in the UK could find renewed interest in politics back home. This is the case for Sylvie, a Macron fan who is studying for a doctorate in Oxford. ""I lost interest in France for four years because I found what was going on there dispiriting,"" she says. ""Since Brexit I've realised that I might have to go back to France, so I'm much more involved now."" Restating the message he had delivered to UK Prime Minister Theresa May earlier in the day, Mr Macron promised the crowd of about 2,000 that he would attract talent back to France by freeing up the economy and encouraging risk-taking and enterprise. He said he had been shocked when a French person he met on the Eurostar train to London had told him that he had gone to Britain to establish his start-up business because he had found it impossible to do so at home. ""What is at stake in this campaign,"" he said to loud applause, ""is making sure that women and men who are willing to create jobs and wealth, who want to change their own lives and that of others, can never say 'I tried to do it in France but it's better to do it a two-hour Eurostar ride away'. I don't want to hear that ever again."" Mr Macron is hoping to buck an international trend towards anti-globalisation populism in a country where market reforms have never been popular. The five-horse race for the French presidency remains wide open. In recent weeks polls have consistently placed far-right leader Marine Le Pen ahead in the first round on 23 April. But they have also suggested she would lose the run-off two weeks later. That suggests the top prize in this election could go to the initial runner-up.Mr Macron surged ahead of his rivals in January but his support has wobbled over the past week, following an outcry over his comment that the colonisation of Algeria had been a ""crime against humanity"". Mainstream conservative Francois Fillon appears to be staging a comeback after damaging allegations over payments to his wife. Two left-wing candidates are not far behind. But what is clear is that the winning candidate will be the one most able to mobilise his constituency - hence the potential importance of the expat vote in this race. ""It is too close to call,"" says Benedicte Paviot, London correspondent for France 24 television. ""French presidential candidates can't afford to ignore French nationals abroad."" "

The government's figures are for the situation after any appeals have been completed, so they depend on how accurately it has predicted their outcome.The government has produced tables showing how much business rates would rise or fall in the coming year, broken down by region of the country and type of business.The overall effect of all the changes comes to zero, which means that the policy is revenue neutral. But there is a key caveat at the bottom of the table, which is that the figures are: ""Before inflation and the adjustment to the multiplier for future appeal outcomes.""The inflation part is widely known. The measure of inflation used will become CPI (Consumer Price Index) instead of RPI (Retail Price Index), which will usually mean the increase is smaller, but that change will not happen until 2020. Increasing rates for RPI will add about 2% per year.But the other part is a bit more complicated - it is the adjustment required to make sure that the changes in rates are revenue neutral even after some businesses have appealed against the rated value of their premises and won. Analysis from the property consultants Gerald Eve suggested that the adjustment would be between four and five percentage points. They did that by working out how much business rates would change across the country to find out what adjustment would then be needed to make the policy revenue neutral again.They add that including both the inflation and the appeals adjustment means that business rates will fall in 135 of the 326 local authorities in England, not 259 as the government claimed. The Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) has strongly disputed suggestions that it has misled people with its figures, but has not disputed the suggestion that the appeals adjustment is between four and five percentage points.Speaking on the Today Programme, Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen said he thought the figures provided, ""might not be giving the picture that businesses in the real world are going to get when they get their bills"".This is certainly true. The DCLG has been clear that its figures are before inflation and the appeals adjustment.The government's figures are for the situation after any appeals have been completed, so they depend on how accurately it has predicted their outcome.Read more from Reality Check"
2017-02-23,Future of EU,https://web.archive.org//web/20170224053928/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39032192,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkMany Europeans eye the months ahead with foreboding. They see anti-establishment parties on the ascendancy. Angela Merkel - for so long Frau Europe - may lose power. And the financial markets are skittish over the possibility of a Marine Le Pen victory in France. Every edge up in her poll ratings sends bond yields rising.And yet an entirely different scenario may play out. It is quite possible that before the end of the year observers will declare that the Brexit-Trump tide has turned and that European integration has found new champions.First to the politics: in the Netherlands Geert Wilders has a history of under-performing at the polls. Even if he emerges as the leader of the largest party after the elections in March, he will struggle to get a foothold in government. The contest that preoccupies Europe's political class, however, is France. The conventional wisdom is that Marine Le Pen will win the first round in the presidential elections but be substantially defeated in round two. But France is on edge, gloomy and unsure of itself. She has expanded her lead in the polls and closed the gap on her most likely challenger in the second round, Emmanuel Macron. Still, he retains a 16% poll lead.But observers no longer trust the polls, and they fear the unforeseen event that could turn even more voters against governing elites.Yet if Marine Le Pen loses, as seems most likely, Europe could be facing an entirely different future. Currently the candidate most likely to win in France is Mr Macron. Yes, he's a novice: a man who has never been elected to high office. He has been drawing the crowds because he has sold himself as a new politician, neither left nor right.As the campaign gets under way, Marine Le Pen will be scathing, dismissing Mr Macron as an international banker, the epitome of the failed global elite, and the man who was Economy Minister under Francois Hollande. Mr Macron has yet to define himself, and he may yet stumble. But if he made it to the Elysee Palace, Europe and France would have a pro-European president, committed to the survival of the euro and the alliance with Germany.At the same time, Germany has grown more restless and more open to change. Some see Angela Merkel, who is hoping for a fourth term as chancellor, as weary and burnt-out. Some of her zeal for power has gone. And many Germans will forever blame her for allowing more than a million refugees into the country.Her main political opponent, the Social Democratic Party, has a new standard bearer in Martin Schulz. In the past month, the SPD has surged 12 points, even surpassing Mrs Merkel's Christian Democratic Union.Mr Schulz is a former President of the European Parliament. For a long time in German politics, he has been known as ""Mr Europe"". He has a good back-story: he's a former bookseller without a high school degree. He is a straight-talker, passionate about Europe and further integration. His greatest strength is his unbridled passion to succeed, his weakness is a love of power and some of its trappings, which he demonstrated in Brussels. He also may stumble, having not yet declared his policy on refugees. And never underestimate the appeal of Angela Merkel and her safe pair of hands. But the crowds are turning out for Mr Schulz, much as they have done for Mr Macron in France. If both men were to win, the outlook in Europe would change suddenly and dramatically.Both are European integrationists who would look to deepen and strengthen the European project. Together, they would breathe new life into the Franco-German relationship that has always been the engine room of the EU. Both, politicians from the centre-left, would loosen austerity further and favour spending on infrastructure projects to help countries such as Italy escape stagnation. There would be little generosity from either man towards Britain as it starts to negotiate its exit from the European Union. Mr Macron has said that it will be ""pretty tough"" on the UK and Mr Schulz would want to see the UK pays a price for its departure. As this European election season begins, no-one yet knows what the Trump effect will be on Europe. Will US President Donald Trump's victory encourage voters that they can support anti-immigration candidates who want powers returned to the nation states and, in the case of France, have a vote on membership of the European Union?Or will President Trump deter voters from taking further risks? Will voters turn away from the United States - whose president has openly discussed which country would leave the EU next - and incline towards building a Europe more confident in its own values and security? The President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, has said Europe wants the US's ""wholehearted and unequivocal support for the idea of a united Europe"". It may not be forthcoming, and the insecurity may yet prompt some voters to back deeper European integration rather the outsiders, the insurgents, the challengers.For Europe, the script for 2017 is a long way from being written and the outcome may yet surprise."
2017-02-23,Jonathan Marcus,https://web.archive.org//web/20170224053928/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39017879,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe Munich Security Conference is at one and the same time an annual jamboree for senior officials and think-tankers and a place where former officials and corporate movers-and-shakers meet up. But it also affords an opportunity for a whole series of behind the scenes bilateral meetings. And once every four years it is the place where Europe takes stock of a new US administration.This year the meeting had added significance since the man in the White House, Donald Trump, is unlike any other president in living memory. His supporters believe he is the man to overturn the ""establishment"" in Washington and to get things done. His detractors believe he is unfit for high office, his erratic behaviour leading some even to question his mental state.Remember this was a man who on the campaign trail described Nato as ""obsolete"" and who said that he would end the free ride that he believed many allies - especially in Europe - were taking at the American taxpayers' expense. So this encounter in Munich was an opportunity for Nato allies to weigh up the new Trump team and to try to gauge the new administration's likely direction. Mr Trump sent his Vice-President Mike Pence to Munich to deliver a series of clearly worded messages. Trump 'unwavering' in support for Nato allies, says PenceWhat does Nato want from Trump?And to avoid any doubt his new defence chief, General James Mattis, provided a warm-up act at Nato headquarters at the end of last week - and to ensure nobody mistakes the message Mr Pence himself will be heading to Brussels, the seat of Nato, once the Munich conference is over. Mr Pence used his Munich speech to bring a message of reassurance from the new president. ""The US,"" he said, strongly supports Nato and will be ""unwavering in its commitment to the trans-Atlantic alliance"" .But with so few allies actually meeting the agreed target for defence spending, there was a warning too. ""Let me be clear on this point,"" he stressed, ""the president of the United States expects our allies to keep their word to fulfil this commitment and for most that means the time has come to do more"".This statement was met with hesitant applause - an indication that many Europeans do not welcome being bullied by the Trump White House. Earlier, German Chancellor Angela Merkel had emphasised that military spending alone was not the only measure of the Europeans' commitment to security.  She calmly - but pointedly - took issue with many of the Trump team's putative policies, noting the importance of international multilateral institutions like the EU and the UN (both of which have been condemned by Mr Trump). Indeed at the end of her speech she seemed to take on the central tenet of the Trump campaign - enshrined in the slogan ""America First!"" Looking to the future she posed a fundamental question. ""Will we be able,"" she asked, ""to act in concert together or (will we) fall back into parochial policies?""One of Europe's greatest fears has been Mr Trump's apparent willingness to do a deal with Moscow - not to mention his evident admiration for Russia's leader Vladimir Putin. Mr Trump's emissaries pretty much convinced their European hosts that on key issues - at least for now - there would be no change. General Mattis insisted that Russia had to abide by international law and US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, on a recent visit to Bonn, stressed that agreements like the Minsk accords to end the fighting in Ukraine had to be fully implemented by all sides - including Moscow. Vice-President Pence emphasised the message saying here in Munich that the US would continue to hold Russia to account, even as it searched for areas of common ground.The Russians have almost been bystanders here watching the internal Nato debate from the sidelines. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov returned to a familiar theme - that Nato was essentially an institution of the past. The expansion of the Atlantic Alliance, he said, had led to an unprecedented level of tensions. What was now needed was what he called a ""post-western world order"". So there seems little chance here for President Trump's hope for fresh understanding with Moscow - or at the very least that it will not come at the expense of the European Nato allies, or perhaps even of Ukraine. If there is a deal to be done between Washington and Moscow it will lie elsewhere, perhaps over Syria.This Munich conference will end on Sunday with many of the concerns of the Europeans only partially stilled. For they relate more to the character and outlook of the new US president himself. One of his tweets can undermine policies that have received bipartisan support in Washington for decades. And its not just a style thing: many of Mr Trump's policies remain unclear, even as so many positions inside his team remain unfilled."
2017-02-23,'Block him out',https://web.archive.org//web/20170224053928/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38096514,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkIf Jenny ever gets married, there will be no dad walking her down the aisle and, if she gets her way, no mention of him on her marriage certificate either.This is because, according to the twenty-something professional, the man who sexually abused her for 18 months from the age of seven ""lost any right to be called my father"".Despite his horrific betrayal of the relationship between father and daughter, the current law gives the option for only his name and occupation to be recorded on her future marriage certificate - but not that of her mother ""who has been mum and dad all wrapped up in one"".This system, of recording only the names of the father of the bride and groom on the certificate, dates back to the early years of Queen Victoria's reign. While either party can ask for a line to be put through that box if they have never known their father or been brought up by a step-father, it's an inequality many people like Jenny feel should be addressed.It is also an issue that has provoked anger among MPs from all parties, who have spent several years attempting to bring about a change in the law to allow both parents to have their names and occupations recorded.Their campaign was given a boost when a petition on Change.org, calling for mothers' names to be added to marriage certificates, collected 70,600 signatures in January 2014. The petition said ""marriage should not be seen as a business transaction between the father of the bride and the father of the groom"".Former Prime Minister David Cameron said later that year that he would address this ""inequality in marriage"", adding that the exclusion of mothers' names from marriage registers in England and Wales did ""not reflect modern Britain"".Mr Cameron was gone from Downing Street before any action was taken and it now seems that Conservative MP Edward Argar's Registration of Marriage Bill is the most likely vehicle to overturn the law.A brief history of marriage:His bill, which would update the Marriage Act of 1949, would move the solely paper-based system to a central electronic register online, which would allow the mother's name to be included.It would also bring England and Wales into line with the rest of the UK. In Scotland and Northern Ireland, couples are asked to give the names of both parents on marriage documentation. The same applies for those entering a civil partnership.Similar attempts by Labour and Conservative MPs to change the law fell in 2015 after failing to get ministers' support. Labour frontbencher Christina Rees' private member's bill focused on the narrow point about putting the mother on the certificate. Former Conservative cabinet minister Dame Caroline Spelman's bill wanted marriages listed in a single electronic register instead of in marriage register books.Former home office minister Richard Harrington said at the time ""a combination"" of the two bills ""could deal with things quickly"".Unlike his predecessors', Mr Argar's bill - which is more like Dame Caroline's attempt - has succeeded in getting government backing because it will create a more secure system for keeping marriage records.""The whole point of this bill is the mothers and fathers of the bride and groom will be registered,"" said the Charnwood MP. ""In the great scheme of things it's a minor change, but it's symbolically very important for a large number of people who want a recognition of the role their mother played in their upbringing.""He added: ""It will also give victims of abuse, children of single mothers or errant fathers, the choice over whether to include their mother's names and not their father's.""You will see virtually no outward change in the form of the marriage ceremony, just in the manner that things are recorded. By moving to an online schedule system, we can easily amend the paper documentation - and it's more secure because it doesn't rely on the old parish register that is at risk of theft from the village church.""The church is supportive of the move, and over time it will save the taxpayer millions of pounds in administrative costs.""The bill is set to return to the Commons for its detailed committee stage after the half-term recess, and Mr Argar is hopeful it will receive Royal Assent - and so become law - by the summer.A spokesman for the Home Office said it wanted to see mothers' names recorded on marriage certificates ""as soon as possible"".Mum's done everythingFor Jenny, whose name has been changed to protect her identity, the law change cannot come soon enough. ""My dad's a rapist and he abused me and my sisters, so I never want any reference to him appearing on anything about my future,"" she said. ""He has no right to that - he lost that right many years ago.""I was only seven when the attacks started, and my siblings were much younger. It ended after I told my mother when I was eight and a half.""I've tried to block out what he did to me. ""I have a partner and I'm sure we will get married eventually, but I don't want my father involved in any way.  I'd only want my mum's name on the marriage certificate because as far as I'm concerned she's done everything for us."""
2017-02-23,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20170224053928/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-39007019,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkFormer Prime Minister Tony Blair has launched a campaign to try to persuade the British people to change their minds about leaving the European Union. It comes just weeks before the government intends to trigger the departure mechanism. In a speech in London, he said that he respected the will of the people, but voters hadn't been given details about the terms on which Britain would exit the EU. Mr Blair argued that what he called the ""cost"" of Brexit was only now becoming clear. The referendum vote, he said, was based on ""imperfect knowledge"" which would now become ""informed knowledge"".It's true that we don't yet know the details of the UK's future relationship with the rest of the EU - that will depend on the deal that is negotiated - but lots was said during the referendum campaign about what Brexit would mean in more general terms. In particular, leading figures in both campaigns said leaving the EU would entail leaving the single market.Mr Blair suggested that immigration was the main issue that propelled Leave to victory in the referendum campaign. But, he argued, the effect of quitting would probably have only a modest impact on overall immigration levels.He pointed out that just over half of migration into the UK comes from outside the EU. That's confirmed by official statistics from the ONS. In the year to June 2016 net migration - the difference between the number of people who arrived and the number of people who left - was 196,000 from outside the EU, compared with 189,000 from inside the EU.The same is true for the gross migration statistics - ie just looking at how many citizens from different parts of the world arrived in the UK.Again, there were slightly more from outside the EU (289,000) than from inside (284,000) along with a smaller number of British citizens returning to live in the UK (77,000). And only an estimated 82,000 or 12.6% of the 650,000 total were EU citizens who arrived looking for work.Theresa May has ruled out introducing a points-based migration system but the government hasn't published details of what it does want to implement. If the new system continues to allow in EU migrants with job offers, as well as students and people coming to join spouses, then Mr Blair's 12% would be, broadly speaking, correct. There could be a bigger impact if the government opts for a capped number of work permits. But about half of total migration will be unaffected no matter what arrangements are made with the EU.This isn't really a fair quotation. It's a reference to an interview given by Philip Hammond on ITV's Peston on Sunday on 26 June.Mr Hammond said: ""I believe it's essential that we protect our access to the single European market. Whether we like it or not, our economy, over 40 years, has become shaped by that access, and to lose that access now would be catastrophic.""But note that he was talking about access to the single market. That's not the same as membership. You don't have to be a member of the single market to have access to it, although the level of access that Britain would have after leaving the single market would depend on what trade relationship was negotiated.It's true that the pound has fallen against the dollar and the euro since the referendum, although not by quite as much as Mr Blair said. It has recovered from its lowest point. Against the dollar, the pound is currently down about 16% compared with its pre-referendum level. Against the euro, it's about 10.5% down.It's also worth noting that the pound/euro exchange rate was at a similar level to now between 2009 and the middle of 2011, so it's hardly unprecedented. Against the dollar, though, the pound has hit multi-decade lows in recent months."

The veteran Gaullist already has form.When he was Commissioner for the Internal Market and Financial Services, Mr Barnier was dubbed ""the most dangerous man in Europe"" after taking on the banking sector and championing a cap on bankers' bonuses. But while he alarmed some in the City, and will probably do so again, he also won grudging respect as a tough but even-handed negotiator.He will need all those skills and more in his new role - chief Brexit negotiator at the European Commission. And having moved seamlessly between big jobs in Paris and Brussels - French foreign minister, Commissioner, MEP - he looks well prepared. ""Don't ask me to tell you what will be at the end of the road, we haven't begun to walk yet,"" he told a conference in Brussels last month. Mr Barnier will stick closely to the official EU position of ""no negotiation without notification"" - waiting for the UK to trigger Article 50 to start the formal process of withdrawal. But he's clearly eager to get going.""I am waiting to begin,"" he said. ""I will be ready tomorrow to negotiate, frankly speaking.""And he will bring with him an instinctive pro-European agenda, and a deep knowledge of the workings of the single market.His deputy as chief Brexit negotiator is a German trade expert, Sabine Weyand, adding to the impression that Mr Barnier will lead a team that means business.One of the biggest challenges he (and his boss Jean-Claude Juncker) faces, is to ensure that representatives of the big member states don't sideline him in the Brexit divorce negotiations.But Mr Barnier's long career in French politics means he could well have the ear of the Elysee Palace, especially if - as looks likely - a centre-right candidate wins the French presidency next year. The stakes are so high that there are bound to be some clashes.Mr Barnier has sparred with the UK's Minister for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, before, when the men both served as Europe ministers in the 1990s. It is another reminder that Michel Barnier is a politician first and foremost, rather than a bureaucrat. There have certainly been criticisms - a dash of vanity, a lack of attention to detail. His career has had plenty of downs as well as ups.But he will defend his European vision to the end, and the British government would do well not to underestimate him.At the height of the eurozone crisis, Mr Barnier always refused (politely) to do broadcast interviews in English.""One wrong word,"" he told me once with a smile, ""and we could move markets.""The next few years will be equally challenging."

Scotland voted 62% in favour of Remain.The conversation online was being driven overwhelmingly by pro-independence campaigners. But people who had supported ""Better Together"" during the Scottish referendum vote also spoke about the possibility of a break-away from the UK as a result of the vote over EU membership.  Perhaps the most significant was Scottish author JK Rowling who tweeted: ""Scotland will seek independence now. Cameron's legacy will be breaking up two unions. Neither needed to happen.""Many took to Twitter to express new or strengthened pro-independence feelings in the wake of the latest vote (Just as a reminder: a ""Yes"" vote in Scotland's 2014 referendum was for independence, while the winning ""No"" campaign backed staying in the UK).One old tweet from 2014's independence referendum gained new life on Friday.

2017-02-24,May hails 'astounding' by-election win,https://web.archive.org//web/20170225020152/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-39076844,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkTheresa May has said the Conservatives' ""astounding"" victory in the Copeland by-election shows her government ""is working for everyone"".The Tories swept aside Labour, which had held the Cumbria seat for 80 years, to record the first by-election gain by a sitting government in 35 years. Mrs May said the success showed her party's broad appeal across England. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has insisted he will stay on after it won a separate by-election in Stoke Central.But one Labour MP has urged him to consider his position following the Copeland loss.On a visit to the constituency, Mrs May said newly elected MP Trudy Harrison had upset the odds in a seat held by Labour since the 1930s. Speaking in Millom, Mrs May told supporters: ""What we've seen from this victory is this truly is a government that's working for everyone and every part of the country - and that's the message that we bring here to Copeland and we'll take across the country.""She praised Mrs Harrison as ""such a fantastic candidate"", one who does not just talk about things, but who ""actually rolls up her sleeves and gets things done"".Labour had held both Stoke and Copeland since their creation but was forced to defend them when two former frontbenchers, Tristram Hunt and Jamie Reed, resigned as MPs.Copeland, created in 1983, and its predecessor constituency Whitehaven have returned Labour MPs since 1935.Mrs Harrison got 44.3% of the vote, increasing the Conservatives' vote share by more than 8%. She overturned a Labour majority of more than 2,564 to take the seat by 2,147 votes - a swing of more than 6%.Professor John Curtice, of Strathclyde University, said the Copeland result was the best by-election performance by a governing party in terms of the increase in its share of the vote since January 1966.In her victory speech, Mrs Harrison said: ""It's been very clear talking to people throughout this campaign that [Labour leader] Jeremy Corbyn doesn't represent them.By Norman Smith, assistant political editorTheresa May finds her grip on British politics hugely strengthened.For a governing party after seven years of austerity to be sweeping aside Labour in a heartland seat and to see their share of the vote increase in another is an extraordinary achievement.It will be taken by her supporters as a vindication of her hard-edged drive towards Brexit and her break with the more metropolitan politics of David Cameron.As for Labour, relief that it has at least repulsed the perceived threat of UKIP but its slow painful anguish under Jeremy Corbyn seems set to continue.In normal times, both by-elections should have raised barely a flicker of concern and while the slide in support may not ignite a further leadership challenge, the convictions of Mr Corbyn's critics that he is leading the party into the wilderness will only have been strengthened.""They want a party which is on the side of ordinary working people, which will respect the way we voted in the referendum and which will build a country which represents everyone. That's why they voted for me tonight.""Mr Corbyn said Labour's ""message was not enough to win through in Copeland"" but hailed victory in Stoke as a ""decisive rejection of UKIP's politics of division and dishonesty"". He added: ""Labour will go further to reconnect with voters and break with the failed political consensus.""But Labour MP John Woodcock, a critic of the leader, said as things stood the party was on course for a ""historic and catastrophic defeat"" at the next general election. In Stoke-on-Trent, UKIP had hoped to capitalise on voters' leanings towards Brexit - the area voted strongly to leave the EU in June.But in his victory speech, the new Labour MP Gareth Snell said voters had ""chosen the politics of hope over the politics of fear"".""This city will not allow ourselves to be defined by last year's referendum and we will not allow ourselves to be divided by the result,"" he said.Labour's share of the vote was 37% - slightly down on the 39.3% it got in 2015. UKIP got 24.7% of the vote and the Conservatives, who came a close third, 24.4% - both slightly higher than their 2015 vote shares.Speaking to journalists after the result, UKIP leader Mr Nuttall said his party's ""time would come"".""There's a lot more to come from us,"" he said. We are not going anywhere, I'm not going anywhere.""The by-election results mean the government's majority is now 12 - the same as it was immediately after the general election, as the Conservative's new Copeland seat makes up for the one they lost to the Lib Dems in the Richmond Park by-election. With Sinn Fein's four MPs not taking their seats, Mrs May's working majority is 16."

Asked if he would fall on his sword following the defeat, he said: ""No. I was elected leader of this party - I'm proud to lead this party.""Mr McDonnell said while he conceded there were ""mixed views on Jeremy"", the result was not about individuals and the Labour leader was not considering his position. ""He's never said that,"" he said.Labour's failure to retain Copeland for the first time since the seat was created highlights three interlinked problems for the party.The most serious is trust - or lack of it.Labour insiders tell me they ""got Jeremy to the right place on nuclear"" - by not just committing to retaining the industry but also no longer opposing new capacity.Yet very few voters here in Whitehaven that I spoke to this morning believed him - and some were still unaware of his position. Read more""He's a different type of leader. He is that sort of person who does listen, who is decent and honest and does bring people together.""He's not the sort of macho leader we've seen in the past, and that's why we've had the disasters that we've had,"" he said.""Our party has got to rebuild itself from the grassroots in the communities like Copeland.""Mr McDonnell said Mr Corbyn ""wants to serve this community and he'll do it well once he becomes prime minister ... because he understands how people feel in places like Copeland"".But he urged the party to unite, and said Mr Blair's speech a week ago, in which he claimed the ""debilitation of the Labour Party is the facilitator of Brexit"" had not been helpful.""We cannot have a circumstance again where a week before the by-election a former leader of our party attacks the party itself,"" he said.Pressed on whether he was blaming Mr Blair for the by-election defeat, Mr McDonnell said: ""It's not his fault. I'm just saying, advice: please don't do that. ""And the same to Peter Mandelson - three days before a by-election he attacks the party. What I'm saying is the central principle of how you win elections is you have a united party, you do not divide the party.""But John Woodcock, Labour MP for Barrow, the neighbouring constituency to Copeland, said there were ""always excuses"" for the by-election reverses and the defeat showed the party was ""in trouble"".Asked if Labour could win the next general election, he told Today the party was ""actually on course to a historic and catastrophic defeat"".That would have ""very serious consequences for all of the communities that we represent and the causes that the Labour party stands for,"" he said.The MP said it would be ""counter-productive"" for him and other critics of Mr Corbyn to demand another leadership election when the outcome was likely to be another victory for Mr Corbyn.""Jeremy Corbyn is going to remain leader of the Labour Party unless he decides that he thinks that it is right to go,"" he said.Veteran Labour backbencher David Winnick said the Copeland result had been ""disastrous"" for the party and urged Mr Corbyn to consider his position.""The party is faced with the problem of a leader who is simply not acceptable to a large number of people who would normally vote Labour. That it is an obstacle and it would be wrong not to recognise that,"" he said.""It is now entirely up to Jeremy and those close to him to decide what is best in the interests not simply of the party but the people we are in politics to represent.""But political scientist Professor John Curtice, of Strathclyde University, told the BBC that even if Mr Corbyn was to go, unless a credible contender comes forward, ""it's not entirely clear Labour's problem would be solved""."

The Electoral Commission has also launched a formal investigation into apparently missing documentation from the Lib Dems and late returns submitted by businessman Peter Harris, who campaigned against EU membership. It has also said it is examining possible discrepancies in paperwork submitted by the European Movement, Labour Leave, UKIP and Conservatives In. "

""He combined the sharp intelligence of a Queen's Counsel with the wit of a proud Lancastrian,"" she said. The Oxford-educated David Waddington served in the army in the 1950s before going into politics and first being elected to Parliament in 1968.He represented a number of different seats in Lancashire between 1968 and 1974, when he lost his seat, and again between 1979 and 1990.After rising through the ministerial ranks, he became chief whip - in charge of party discipline - before succeeding Lord Hurd as home secretary in October 1989.A supporter of capital punishment, he took a tougher line on law and order issues than his predecessor, piloting legislation through the Commons in 1990 to ensure serious criminals served longer sentences.He stood down after John Major became prime minister in November 1990 and accepted a peerage soon afterwards.He retired from the House of Lords in 2015.

""So all of those people claiming this is essential to reduce violence against women, what do they say now? Absolutely nothing.""Sarah Scott was raped after a girls' night out by an acquaintance who persuaded her to go to his flat by saying her friends were already there.Ruddock threatened to kill her and she was beaten and raped.In May 2011 he was convicted at the High Court in Aberdeen and sentenced to eight years imprisonment."

The DUP said they were given more money than they spent and the remainder of the donation, around £9,000 was transferred to the party's funds with the agreement of the Constitutional Research Council.Speaking on the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme, Mr Donaldson stressed it was ""not a Northern Ireland referendum, but a UK-wide referendum"".The revelation came as the spending returns of the Stronger In and Vote Leave campaigns in last year's EU referendum are under investigation, the Electoral Commission has announced.A total of more than £32m was spent on the campaign - with the Leave side funded by donations totalling £16.4m, outgunning the Remain side's £15.1m.During the referendum campaign, the DUP took out a four-page ""Vote To Leave EU"" advertisement in the Metro newspaper - which is available in London and other cities but not in Northern Ireland.Earlier this month, DUP leader Arlene Foster declined to reveal the identity of the donor or donors but said the money was properly accounted for ""under the rules as they currently stand"".While political donations in Northern Ireland are kept confidential for fear of identifying donors, other parties had called on the DUP to clarify who funded its ""lavish"" pro-Brexit advertising campaign.Mr Donaldson said his party had ""reached millions"" by spending the money on media outside of Northern Ireland. He denied the DUP had broken the spirit of electoral law.""Absolutely not, the DUP registered as a national campaign organisation for the referendum,"" he said.""The law is very clear, the political parties and referendums act allows any political organisation to register nationally to participate in a campaign.  ""We recognised that this referendum was going to be won or lost on a national basis. That's why we spent money advertising in the Metro free sheet because it would reach far more people.""This way we reached millions of people and the feedback we got back from our campaign was very, very positive."""

Of course he was right.""He added: ""Will I ever forgive the British media for what they've done to me? No.""Earlier this month, the former UKIP leader and his successor Paul Nuttall narrowly avoided an egg, which was said to have been thrown by a youth.Mr Farage, who has been hired by Fox News as a political analyst since stepping down as UKIP leader after the EU referendum in 2016, hinted at a possible political comeback in the UK.When asked about Brexit he said: ""If this falls to bits, anything could happen, let's see.""He also refused to rule out a bid to become prime minister, adding: ""If this political class let us down on Brexit, then anything can happen."" Mr Farage, whose wife Kirsten recently said she and her husband had been living ""separate lives for some years"", also reiterated his hopes for a ""normal"" life.He told Morgan: ""One of my hopes is that life will start getting a little bit more normal going on from here. I hope it can't be as bad as it's been, can it?""He said his marriage was ""a bit like most others really - all marriages, all relationships have huge ups and downs"".Mr Farage told reporters he ""wants his life back"" when he stood down as UKIP leader last July following the Brexit vote.Piers Morgan's Life Stories will be broadcast on ITV at 21:00 GMT on Friday (24 February)."

It took us 23-odd years to win a referendum to get Britain out of the European Union.""It may take that long for us to get a seat in Westminster via a by-election. But if that's how long it takes then that's what we will keep doing, because that's what we are here for.""The party has previously had two wins in by-elections - in 2014 - but both of those had been Tory MPs who had quit their party and then stood in the same constituencies for UKIP at the subsequent by-elections.One of those, Douglas Carswell, held on to his seat in Clacton, Essex, at the 2015 general election. However, Mark Reckless lost his Kent seat of Rochester and Strood back to the Conservatives.Analysis by Chris Mason, political correspondentThe questions facing Labour in Copeland are tumbling UKIP's way here in Stoke.A party whose very success in achieving the thing they were set up to achieve, Brexit, brought with it a blunt question - what is the point of them now?The answer sounded like this: winning traditionally Labour seats from Labour.And yet here in Stoke-on-Trent, a hubbub of Brexiteer jubilation after the referendum, they failed.UKIP insists this seat was always well down their target list. But on a night where Labour was sufficiently vulnerable to lose a previously rock-solid seat in Cumbria, UKIP's still the bridesmaid not the bride in the Potteries.All of which begs two questions: If not here, where? If not now, when?UKIP had regarded Stoke as a promising opportunity to make a different kind of electoral breakthrough, taking the fight to Labour in constituencies that had voted overwhelmingly in favour of Brexit at last year's EU referendum.The party pinned its hopes on its new leader but his efforts were not enough to prevent Gareth Snell holding the Staffordshire city seat for Labour.Mr Oakden said UKIP had gone into Thursday's by-election with ""high hopes and optimism"" but had never assumed they were favourites to win the Stoke seat.He told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme: ""Sadly the four-week campaign that we had just wasn't enough to introduce ourselves and our new leader to the voters in Stoke-on-Trent Central.""But actually we are very pleased coming out of yesterday - disappointed but pleased that we managed to improve on our vote result in 2015.""We think that there is enough there to be very hopeful and optimistic about.""He added: ""This is a stepping stone, it is a disappointing night because we were hoping that we might win, but certainly it gives us some optimism for the future.""Mr Oakden admitted a false claim that Mr Nuttall had lost close friends in the Hillsborough football disaster had overshadowed the campaign, describing it as a ""very unfortunate episode on a very sensitive issue"".But he said voters had barely mentioned it, saying: ""There were other things that people wanted to talk about.""And he denied that Mr Nuttall had risked his reputation by losing the by-election and failing to take votes from Labour.Mr Oakden said: ""Paul Nuttall believes in leading from the front and that is exactly what he did by making himself the candidate in this election, and that is why it was a courageous thing to do and that is why our party are wholesome in their support of him as a leader this morning.""But Nigel Farage said the party had to learn lessons following the by-election defeat, adding that he believed UKIP should have been stronger on immigration.He conceded that his successor as leader had ""paid the price"" for some mistakes made about his association with the Hillsborough disaster, but added: ""I don't believe it reflects on Paul."""

We are not going anywhere, I'm not going anywhere.""UKIP chairman Paul Oakden said:  ""The whole narrative of Paul's leadership depends on winning in Stoke is a nonsense."" Labour MP Jack Dromey, who ran Mr Snell's campaign, said: ""I think as we win we need necessary humility because there is a view that Labour is no longer listening in the way it should do.""I think what we have done in this community is precisely to do that.  ""Are we yet a credible alternative government? No we're not. But tonight is a decisive moment.""The by-election results mean the government's majority is now 12 - the same as it was immediately after the general election, as the Conservative's new Copeland seat  makes up for the one they lost to the Lib Dems in the Richmond Park by-election. The working majority is 16."
2017-02-24,"Net migration to UK falls by 49,000",https://web.archive.org//web/20170225020152/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-39062436,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkNet migration to the UK has dropped to 273,000 in the year to September, down 49,000 from the previous year.The Office for National Statistics said it was the first time in two years the balance of people arriving and leaving the UK had dipped below 300,000.But it is short of the government's aim of an annual figure below 100,000.Immigration was estimated to be 596,000 - comprising 268,000 EU citizens, 257,000 non-EU citizens and 71,000 British citizens. This included the highest level ever recorded of Romanians and Bulgarians - 74,000. Some 323,000 people are thought to have left the UK in the year to September, up by 26,000 on the 12 months to September 2015.Of these, 128,000 were British citizens, along with 103,000 EU citizens and 93,000 non-EU citizens.Net migration is down. But while the net decrease looks substantial, nobody can say for sure what's triggered the change because these quarterly figures could have been influenced by a string of short-term factors.For a start, there appears to have been a rise in emigration - and when that goes up, net migration can come down.Secondly, some of the change could be down to seasonal fluctuations in student numbers.Thirdly, although there were significant departures by people from some parts of Eastern Europe, the number coming from poorer Romania and Bulgaria went up. The upshot is the overall number of people arriving for a job is broadly the same. What does it all amount to? Immigration statistics are an inexact science - and at the moment it's very difficult to know for sure what's going on.The figures are the first to include migration estimates following the EU referendum in June.Nicola White, head of international migration statistics at the ONS, said it was ""too early"" to say what effect the referendum has had on long-term migration.Home Secretary Amber Rudd accepted the government was still far from reaching its net migration target, but said the figures demonstrated ""we can reduce immigration where we can control it"".She denied a rise in people going back to countries such as Poland reflected an uncertainty among EU citizens living in the UK over their futures.Ms Rudd said: ""At the moment we have open immigration with the EU members, freedom of movement, so they can come and go as they want.""I don't see any particularly significant change within EU migration. The real change will be when we leave the EU, and then we will be able to make the choices ourselves what level of immigration we want to have.""And she said that Britain remained open to EU citizens already living here and contributing to the economy, saying: ""Let's not be in any doubt that the UK will always be a welcoming place for people who want to come here, work here and contribute to our economy.""Sunder Katwala, director of the think-tank British Future, said the figures showed the immigration debate will ""have to move on"" in the light of Brexit.He said: ""A one-size-fits-all approach to immigration can't help us make the post-Brexit choices that the government and the public now face.""Meanwhile, separate figures from the Home Office show that a near-record number of EU nationals were granted British citizenship last year.Citizenship was given to 16,754 people from EU countries, the second highest since records were first compiled, behind the 17,645 in 2013.Some 6,498 members of the EU 14 countries - older member states such as France, Spain and Germany - were granted UK citizenship in 2016, up 50% on the previous 12 months and the highest ever for a single year.A further 6,813 people from the EU 8 countries, which include Poland, gained British citizenship, a rise of 18%, surpassed only by figures for 2013.Citizenship was given to 3,215 Romanians and Bulgarians, up 20% on 2015 and again only topped by 2013 figures.Other points within the ONS statistics were:"

He has now won two election contests within the Labour Party.""She agreed that the UK leader could ""absolutely"" take Labour to a general election victory.Ms Dugdale added: ""What people want to vote for is a united party. ""I am fully behind Jeremy Corbyn in his efforts to renew and build the Labour Party across the whole of the UK, just as I know he supports my efforts in Scotland where I have a long plan to renew the party's fortunes here.""The three-day conference will include speeches from Ms Dugdale, Mr Corbyn and London mayor Sadiq Khan.Delegates will also debate policy resolutions on topics including federalism, the economy and local government, while looking ahead to May's council elections.All of Holyrood's political parties are holding conferences in the coming weeks.The theme of the Scottish Labour conference is ""together we're stronger"".Our political correspondent Nick Eardley will be talking to Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale and he wants you to send on your questions. His Facebook Live interview will take place at 15:00. Watch it and take part too.In her foreward in the conference handbook, Ms Dugdale said this was because ""it's more important than ever that we work together to build Scotland for the future"".She said: ""What people across Scotland want now, more than ever, is a plan for the future that puts their families, their job and the public services they rely on first.""Employers and trade unions need stability and support. We don't need another divisive referendum.""We can't allow our future to be shaped by the Tories or the SNP who only seek to divide our country.""Ms Dugdale will address delegates on Saturday, after Mr Khan and deputy UK leader Tom Watson.Mr Corbyn and Shadow Scottish Secretary Dave Anderson will speak on Sunday, before Scottish deputy leader Alex Rowley closes the conference.Mr Corbyn said a ""strong, united and confident Labour party"" was needed amid the ""tumultuous and challenging"" state of politics across the globe.One of the first policies debated at the conference will be Ms Dugdale's proposals for a federal UK.She told BBC Radio Scotland that Mr Corbyn ""fully supports"" a people's constitutional convention to examine issues of power across the UK.Ms Dugdale added: ""I have referred to it as an Act of Union and I understand Jeremy Corbyn might prefer to use other words because he has to examine the case for powers across the whole of the UK - not just between Scotland and Westminster, he has got to consider the needs of Wales, the needs of London, the needs of the north of England.""She went on: ""We shouldn't obsess about the words - what there is underneath all of this is a principle and a great idea of how we can heal our divided country, bring people back together, unite our country, focus on the future and all the challenges that we face."""

2017-02-24,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20170225020152/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThis article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide to the UK's vote to leave the European Union. It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 52% to 48%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who resigned on the day after losing the referendum. Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she says she will respect the will of the people. She has said ""Brexit means Brexit"" but there is still a lot of debate about what that will mean in practice especially on the two key issues of how British firms do business in the European Union and what curbs are brought in on the rights of European Union nationals to live and work in the UK. She set out more details of her negotiating hopes in her key speech on Brexit.The UK economy appears to have weathered the initial shock of the Brexit vote, although the value of the pound remains near a 30-year low, but opinion is sharply divided over the long-term effects of leaving the EU. Some major firms such as Easyjet and John Lewis have pointed out that the slump in sterling has increased their costs. Britain also lost its top AAA credit rating, meaning the cost of government borrowing will be higher. But share prices have recovered from a dramatic slump in value, with both the FTSE 100 and the broader FTSE 250 index, which includes more British-based businesses, trading higher than before the referendum. The Bank of England cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - a record low and the first cut since 2009 - after the vote and there has not been the economic slump or recession that some had predicted. The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it has to invoke an agreement called Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May has said she intends to trigger this process by the end of March 2017, meaning the UK will be expected to have left by the summer of 2019, depending on the precise timetable agreed during the negotiations. The government will also enact a Great Repeal Bill which will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. It is expected to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove.After a court battle, the UK's Supreme Court ruled in January that Parliament must be consulted before Article 50 is invoked. This is why a two line Brexit bill is currently making its way through Parliament. MPs have approved it after Labour MPs were told to support it. It has got through its first House of Lords debate with debate and votes on possible changes expected in the next week.Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These men - dubbed the Three Brexiteers - will play a central role in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although it will be Mrs May, as prime minister, who will have the final say. David Cameron's government did not do any emergency planning for Brexit ahead of the referendum and Mrs May has rejected calls to say what her negotiating goals are.Once Article 50 has been triggered, the UK will have two years to negotiate its withdrawal. But no one really knows how the Brexit process will work - Article 50 was only created in late 2009 and it has never been used. Former Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, now Chancellor, wanted Britain to remain in the EU, and he has suggested it could take up to six years for the UK to complete exit negotiations. The terms of Britain's exit will have to be agreed by 27 national parliaments, a process which could take some years, he has argued. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. The UK will continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making.Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Following Theresa May's Brexit recent speech we now know that the UK is not intending to stay in the EU's single market. Although there has been speculation for months about the issue, it would have meant the UK staying under the auspices of the European Court of Justice and having to allow unlimited EU immigration, under freedom of movement rules.Both sides want trade to continue after Brexit with the UK seeking a positive outcome for those who wish to trade goods and services"" - such as those in the City of London and wanting a ""comprehensive free trade deal"" giving the UK ""the greatest possible access"" to the single market. Mrs May says she wants the UK to reach a new customs union deal with the EU. A customs union is where countries agree not to impose tariffs on each others' goods and have a common tariff on goods coming in from elsewhere. The UK is currently part of the EU customs union but that stops the UK being able to do its own trade deals with other countries. Reality Check: How could customs union work?These terms have increasingly been used as debate focused on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people in order to maintain access to the EU single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result.The government has declined to give a firm guarantee about the status of EU nationals currently living in the UK, saying this is not possible without a reciprocal pledge from other EU members about the millions of British nationals living on the continent. EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, will be be able to stay, the chief civil servant at the Home Office has said. The rights of other EU nationals would be subject to negotiations on Brexit and the ""will of Parliament"", he added.A lot depends on the kind of deal the UK agrees with the EU. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions on EU nationals, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.Again, it depends on whether the UK government decides to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages. Citizens' Advice has reminded people their rights have not changed yet and asked anyone to contact them if they think they have been discriminated against following the Leave vote.Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested EU migrants who come to the UK as Brexit nears may not be given the right to stay. He has said there might have to be a cut-off point if there was a ""surge"" in new arrivals.People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote. The day-to-day spending impact is likely to be more significant. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it to remain at least 10% below where it was on 23 June, in the long term. This means imported goods will consequently get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have already been seen and the issue was most notably illustrated by the dispute between Tesco and Marmite's makers about whether prices would be put up or not in the stores.The latest UK inflation figures, for January, showed the CPI inflation rate rising to 1.8%, its highest level for two and a half years, with signs of more cost pressures set to feed through in the months to come.Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration.She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations. As mentioned above, the key issue is whether other EU nations will grant the UK access to the single market, if that is what it wants, while at the same time being allowed to restrict the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK.Mrs May has said she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. It is currently running at 330,000 a year, of which 184,000 are EU citizens, and 188,000 are from outside the EU - the figures include a 39,000 outflow of UK citizens.It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Liberal Democrats - who have just a handful of MPs - have vowed to halt Brexit and keep Britain in the EU if they were to win the next general election.Some commentators, including former House of Commons clerk Lord Lisvane, have argued that a further referendum would be needed to ratify whatever deal the UK hammers out with the EU, but there are few signs political leaders view this as a viable option.Yes. Theresa May has appeared keen to avoid a vote on her negotiating stance, to avoid having to give away her priorities, but Theresa May has said there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. It is worth mentioning that any deal also has to be agreed by the European Parliament - with British MEPs getting a chance to vote on it there.  While there could be limitations on British nationals' ability to live and work in EU countries, it seems unlikely they would want to deter tourists. There are many countries outside the European Economic Area, which includes the 28 EU nations plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway, that British citizens can visit for up to 90 days without needing a visa and it is possible that such arrangements could be negotiated with European countries.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. In theory, the government could, if it wanted, decide to change the colour, which is currently standardised for EU countries, says the BBC's Europe correspondent, Chris Morris.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketNo nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it is ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faces being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. A second independence referendum for the country is now ""highly likely"", she has said, although not in 2017. She has said she wants Scotland to stay in the single market and said Mrs May's decision to rule out the UK staying in the single market ""undoubtedly"" brings the referendum closer.Before his resignation Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said the impact in Northern Ireland would be ""very profound"" and that the whole island of Ireland should now be able to vote on reunification. But, speaking while she was still Northern Ireland Secretary, Theresa Villiers ruled out the call from Sinn Féin for a border poll, saying the circumstances in which one would be called did not exist. The land border is likely to be a key part of the Brexit talks. Theresa May said a priority for her would be negotiating a deal with the EU which allowed a common travel area between the UK and the Republic of Ireland.During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest. But his successor Theresa May has said she will keep it in place, at least for the current Parliament, which is due to last until 2020.So far there has been a cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. There are yet to be signs that rising inflation have worried the Bank of England  enough to consider raising interest rates.  But if that happened it would make mortgages and loans more expensive to repay - but would be good news for savers.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.Eurotunnel boss Jacques Gounon said last November the reintroduction of duty-free would be ""an incredible boost for my business"" but he later said  that remark had been ""light-hearted"". Erik Juul-Mortensen, president of the Tax Free World Association (TFWA) said after the referendum vote ""it is not possible to predict how Brexit will affect the duty free and travel retail industry, and it is wiser not to make assumptions about exactly what the impact will be.""  They are at the moment but no-one knows the longer term prospects for definite. The EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - is not an EU initiative. It was negotiated between countries within a group known as the European Economic Area, often simply referred to as the single market (plus Switzerland, which confusingly is not a member of the EEA, but has agreed access to the single market). Therefore, the future of Britons' EHIC cover could depend on whether the UK decided to sever ties with the EEA.Probably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report. In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two-thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.However, the UK government is committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, the UK government is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR. However, the EU has its own European Court of Justice, whose decisions are binding on EU institutions and member states.Its rulings have sometimes caused controversy in Britain and supporters of a Brexit have called for immediate legislation to curb its powers. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also cited sovereignty and democracy, and they wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Four of the biggest US banks have committed to helping maintain the City's position. But HSBC will move up to 1,000 jobs to Paris, the BBC understands. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Pest control firm Rentokil Initial says it could make £15m extra this year thanks to a weaker currency.Others are less optimistic. Hilary Jones, a director at UK cosmetics firm Lush said the company was ""terrified"" about the economic impact. She added that while the firm's Dorset factory would continue to produce goods for the UK market, products for the European market may be made at its new plant in Germany.Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After the Leave vote, the government will probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""As with most elements of the UK economy, not enough solid data has been published yet to accurately conclude the Brexit effect on house prices. Industry figures have pointed to ""uncertainty"" among buyers and sellers that could potentially change the housing market.So far, the most significant research has come from the respected Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which has published the conclusions of a survey of its members. This primarily records sentiment among surveyors.It found that house prices are expected to fall across the UK in the three months after the referendum vote. However, the dip in prices is only expected to persist over the 12 months from June in London and East Anglia, surveyors predict.House prices were already slowing in central London, owing to the fall-out from changes to stamp duty rules in April.Separate figures from property portal Rightmove suggested the average asking price of houses coming on to the market in England and Wales fell by 0.9%, or £2,647, in July compared with June. It said that agents had reported very few sales had fallen through as a result of the vote.Many potential first-time buyers would welcome a fall in house prices, with ownership among the young falling owing to affordability concerns. Investors in property, or those who have paid off a mortgage and hope to leave homes as inheritance would be unhappy with a long-term reduction in value.  Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law following the decision to leave the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" will not necessarily disappear overnight - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU means the UK will not be part of TTIP. It will have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Former Labour health secretary Lord Owen has said that because of TTIP (see answer above) the only way to protect the NHS from further privatisation was to get out of the EU."

A flurry of resignations in the run-up to the recent Brexit Bill forced the Labour leader to announce his fourth re-shuffle since taking charge.Four roles in particular have seen the greatest turnover, each with four MPs filling these positions since September 2015, when Mr Corbyn took charge. The latest re-shuffle puts newcomers Rebecca Long-Bailey and Christina Rees into two of these roles."
2017-02-24,Who's Who: Theresa May's cabinet,https://web.archive.org//web/20170225020152/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36785814,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkTheresa May is forming her new government after becoming Conservative prime minister. She is continuing to announce her full cabinet - but here's what we know so far. The list will be updated as new appointments are made. Campaigned to Remain in the European Union The former home secretary, 59, becomes the UK's second female prime minister in the wake of David Cameron's resignation after the EU referendum. She had previously served in the Home Office for more than six years. Theresa May: Full profileHow does May's cabinet compare to Cameron's?Campaigned to Leave the EUBoris Johnson succeeds Philip Hammond at the Foreign Office. The former London mayor headed the campaign for the UK to leave the European Union. He did not previously have a ministerial appointment in Mr Cameron's government but accepted an invitation to attend political cabinet. He was not running any department. Mr Johnson, 52, may be one of the best known politicians in the country but the move to foreign secretary is a big step up from his previous role.Read how the world has reacted.Leave campaignerDavid Davis has been appointed to the new cabinet position of secretary of state for exiting the European Union - or ""Brexit secretary"". A veteran Eurosceptic, he has previously held the positions of Conservative party chairman and shadow deputy prime minister. Between 2003 and 2008, he was the shadow home secretary under both Michael Howard and David Cameron. Mr Davis, 67, lost to David Cameron in the 2005 Tory leadership contest. Details about the new Brexit department are still emerging, but it is likely to take the lead in negotiating Britain's departure from the EU and unpicking the thousands of pages of EU rules written into UK law.Theresa May is reported to have ordered civil servants to find a building for the new department.Leave campaignerLiam Fox, 54, has taken on another newly created position as secretary of state for international trade. He was made secretary of state for defence in 2010 but resigned in 2011 over allegations he had given a close friend, lobbyist Adam Werritty, access to the Ministry of Defence and allowed him to join official trips overseas.Like Mr Davis he is a Eurosceptic who voted to leave the EU and he also stood unsuccessfully for the Conservative Party leadership in 2005.He stood again in the latest race to be leader but was eliminated in the first ballot after winning the support of just 16 MPs.Remain campaignerThe appointment to chief whip is a big step up for Gavin Williamson, according to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg.David Cameron's former parliamentary private secretary, he also served as parliamentary private secretary to transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin.The 40-year-old from North Yorkshire was elected MP for South Staffordshire in 2010. As chief whip, he will attend Cabinet meetings.Remain campaignerKaren Bradley takes over from the deposed John Whittingdale as Culture, Media and Sport Secretary. She had been working with Theresa May as a Home Office minister since 2014.She was first elected MP for Staffordshire Moorlands in May 2010.Her appointment comes two months after Mr Whittingdale and the BBC agreed a major overhaul of the corporation.Read more about her appointment here.Leave campaignerAndrea Leadsom, the Conservative leadership candidate who dramatically pulled out of the race, is the new Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Secretary.The prominent Brexit backer is promoted from energy minister to a cabinet role which will see her take responsibility for a farming industry as it faces the end of European Union subsidies. She will also have to fashion a post-Brexit fisheries policy. Green campaigners will be watching carefully to see what happens to environment regulations in areas including wildlife habitats, air pollution and water quality, currently governed by rules from Europe. Mrs Leadsom's public reason for withdrawing from the leadership race was to allow a rapid transition at the top, and give the economy certainty in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. But our political editor Laura Kuenssberg says her friends were saying she was alarmed by the level of scrutiny given to her comments on motherhood reported in the Times.Read more on Mrs Leadsom's motivations for stepping aside here.Baroness Evans of Bowes Park becomes leader of the House of Lords at 40, in her first ministerial role since being ennobled by David Cameron in 2014.She attended London's Henrietta Barnett School and Cambridge University before becoming deputy director of the Conservative research department, deputy director of the Policy Exchange think-tank and chief operating officer of the New Schools Network - the organisation which ran Michael Gove's free schools programme.Remain campaignerDamian Green is appointed the new Work and Pensions Secretary, taking over from Stephen Crabb, who earlier resigned.Mr Green served as an Immigration Minister and Justice Secretary in the coalition government but has been on the backbenches since 2014.Leave campaignerPriti Patel is the new International Development Secretary, a promotion from her role as employment minister which she's held for just a year.Ms Patel became MP for Witham in 2010 and joined the front bench as a Treasury minister in 2014.She is no stranger to controversy, having previously advocated bringing back the death penalty and was accused of ""divide and rule politics"" during the referendum campaign for claiming that ""biased"" immigration policy prevents curry chefs from outside the EU from working in the UK.On her appointment, she immediately faced calls to guarantee the UK's legal commitment to spending 0.7% of GDP on overseas aid.Remain campaignerGreg Clark is secretary of state of a newly-created ministry of business, energy and industrial strategy.His appointment spells the end for a department which put climate change at the top of the agenda.Just eight years after it was created by then-prime minister Gordon Brown, the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) is being merged into Mr Clark's new department and losing the ""climate change"" part of its name.Environmentalists immediately expressed concern that the reshaping of departments showed the government was downgrading climate change as a priority.But Richard Black, director of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU), said Mr Clark's move was ""an excellent appointment"", saying he ""understands climate change, and has written influential papers on the benefits of Britain developing a low-carbon economy"".Remain campaignerJames Brokenshire, who has been working with Theresa May at the Home Office - where he was immigration minister - has been made Northern Ireland Secretary.He takes over from Theresa Villiers, who resigned from the cabinet having been offered another role but saying it was not one ""which I felt I could take on"". Before entering parliament Mr Brokenshire was a partner at a large international law firm.From 2011 to 2015, he served as security minister at the Home Office with responsibility for domestic national security and counter terrorism. This included supporting the home secretary with oversight of the work of MI5 and the national police counter-terrorism network.His responsibilities also included the government's counter-terrorism strategy and he was part of the prime minister's ""extremism taskforce"". He also led negotiations with the Jordanian government to secure the deportation of the radical cleric Abu Qatada.Read more on his appointment here.Remain campaignerDavid Lidington, former Europe Minister, is promoted to Leader of the House. He had been Europe Minister since 2010 but moves across to a post involving the smooth running of the Commons. The Cambridge history graduate and father-of-four has been MP for Aylesbury since 1992. He previously worked for BP and mining firm Rio Tinto.Campaigned to Remain in the EUPhilip Hammond has been named chancellor of the exchequer. He was foreign secretary under David Cameron from 2014 to 2016, having previously served as defence secretary and transport secretary. He replaces George Osborne.Mr Hammond, 60, is seen at Westminster as the ultimate safe pair of hands. Sometimes mocked as ""box office Phil"" for what some see as his dull delivery, he forged a reputation in the shadow Treasury team as the Tories' public spending ""axeman"".He was seen as a Eurosceptic who spoke of withdrawal if the EU were not reformed, but was a Remain campaigner in the referendum. He now has the job of steering Britain's economy through the choppy post-Brexit waters.Read what Mr Hammond has to say on his first day in the job.Remain campaignerAmber Rudd has been made home secretary, filling the vacancy left by Mrs May. Ms Rudd was formerly energy and climate change secretary, a position she held for just one year.During the campaign for Remain in the EU referendum, she warned in a TV debate that she would not trust the new Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson to drive her home at the end of a night out.The former investment banker, venture capitalist, and financial journalist, aged 52, decided to enter politics in her 40s in order to get ""a grip on her life"". She quickly joined the fast track to the top after being elected to Parliament as MP for Hastings and Rye. She was seen as a protege of then Chancellor George Osborne, serving as his parliamentary private secretary before being promoted to junior minister at the Energy and Climate Change department in 2014. Remain campaignerLiz Truss moves from her role as secretary for environment, food and rural affairs to replace Michael Gove as justice secretary.A qualified management accountant, she became MP for South West Norfolk in 2010 and was appointed education minister in 2012.She was brought up in Yorkshire and attended Roundhay, a comprehensive school in Leeds, and went on to read philosophy, politics and economics at Merton College, Oxford.Socially liberal, the 40-year-old was a founder member of the free enterprise group of Conservative MPs arguing for more deregulation of the economy.Remain campaignerJustine Greening has said she is ""absolutely delighted"" to be made the new education secretary, taking over from Nicky Morgan. She was also appointed minister for women and equalities. Her new department will also take on higher and further education, skills and apprenticeships.Ms Greening leaves her international development secretary post, which she was promoted to in October 2011.MP for Putney since 2005, she became economic secretary to the Treasury after the 2010 election, succeeding Philip Hammond as transport secretary after he was promoted to defence secretary.At London's Pride day on 25 June, two days after the Brexit vote, the 47-year-old announced in a tweet she was in a same-sex relationship, saying ""I campaigned for Stronger In but sometimes you're better off out!"".Read more about what's awaiting Ms Greening at the education department.Leave campaignerChris Grayling, Theresa May's leadership campaign chief, has been appointed transport secretary. He was formerly Leader of the House.The most pressing jobs in his in-tray include dealing with the travel chaos caused by Southern Rail's disrupted services, the expansion of airport capacity in south-east England and high speed rail link, HS2.He's got some experience in this department, having served as shadow transport secretary from December 2005 to 2007.The Brexiteer had a surprisingly low-key, restrained referendum, largely refraining from ""blue-on-blue"" attacks. He was also one of the few Vote Leave spokesmen to share a platform with former UKIP leader Nigel Farage. Remain campaignerPatrick McLoughlin leaves his role as transport secretary to become Conservative Party chairman and chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.An MP since 1986, the former miner also served as chief whip, after being appointed to the role in David Cameron's first cabinet.As transport secretary, he was in charge of several large-scale projects including Crossrail and HS2. The 58-year-old said he was ""very pleased indeed"" with his new role.Remain campaignerSajid Javid is moved sideways from business secretary to secretary of the department for communities and local government.Mr Javid, considered a protege of former chancellor George Osborne's, held the culture secretary position before being appointed to the business role last year and is a former managing director of Deutsche Bank. The 46-year-old University of Exeter graduate stood on a ""joint ticket"" with Stephen Crabb for the leadership election, hoping to be chancellor if Mr Crabb had become PM.Remain campaignerMichael Fallon has kept his job at the Ministry of Defence - a position the 64-year-old has held since 2014.He was Conservative MP for Darlington from 1983 to 1992 - initially during Margaret Thatcher's time in Downing Street - and after leaving Parliament, he was later re-elected as MP for Sevenoaks in 1997.A former Conservative Party deputy chairman, he has previously served as energy and business minister, and before that secretary of state for business and enterprise.Seen as a safe pair of hands in Westminster, he described himself as a ""pretty reluctant Remainer"" after the EU referendum.Remain campaignerDespite earlier speculation, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt remains in his post.The 49-year-old was appointed culture secretary in David Cameron's first coalition government, a role he held for two years - including while London played host to the 2012 Olympic Games.He took over the health portfolio following a cabinet reshuffle in 2012, and described the appointment as the ""biggest privilege of my life"". Most recently, Mr Hunt has been locked in a battle with the British Medical Association over a new contract for junior doctors, which has led to a series of strikes.Remain campaignerDavid Mundell will continue as Secretary of State for Scotland.Mr Mundell, the only Scottish Conservative MP, said his focus was now on ""ensuring Scotland gets the best possible deal out of the EU negotiations"".Former prime minister David Cameron first appointed Mr Mundell to the post when he held his Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale seat for the third consecutive election in 2015.Remain campaignerMay's cabinet: Who's in and who's out? Alun Cairns, MP for the Vale of Glamorgan, remains in his cabinet role as secretary of state for Wales.He was appointed to the post just four months ago so there was little surprise that he will retain his position. The 45-year-old, who was born in Swansea and is a graduate of the University of Wales, Newport, was elected as MP for the Vale of Glamorgan in 2010. He worked in banking for a decade before his election to the Welsh Assembly. Remain campaignerGeorge Osborne has been fired as chancellor.He had been in the Treasury since 2010 - throughout David Cameron's tenure in Downing Street. He had also been first secretary of state since May 2015. A key ally of Mr Cameron, Mr Osborne tweeted it had been a ""privilege"" to be chancellor, adding: ""Others will judge - I hope I've left the economy in a better state than I found it.""Leave campaignerMichael Gove has been fired as justice secretary. The former Times journalist also served under David Cameron as education secretary in the coalition government, and as chief whip.He successfully campaigned for Brexit alongside Boris Johnson - but later withdrew his support for his colleague to be Conservative leader and prime minister, instead standing himself. He was eliminated in the final round of voting by MPs in third place.His surprise move to stand for the leadership and therefore to become prime minister effectively dashed Mr Johnson's hopes of running.Remain campaignerNicky Morgan is to leave her post as education secretary. The 43-year-old, who qualified as a lawyer, became an MP in 2010 and rose to the cabinet position of minister for women and equalities in 2013.London-born Ms Morgan replaced Michael Gove as education secretary in 2014. She reportedly considered standing in the Conservative leadership contest, but ultimately threw her support behind leave campaigner Mr Gove, despite campaigning for a Remain vote herself.In a tweet, she said she was ""disappointed"" not to be continuing her work in the education department, before congratulating her successor Justine Greening, saying she was ""committed to excellence in education"".Remain campaignerWork and Pensions Secretary Stephen Crabb has resigned from government ""in the best interests of my family"". He was one of the four contenders who lost out to Theresa May for the Conservative leadership.BBC political correspondent Vicki Young says it's not yet known whether Mr Crabb was offered a post he did not want or had just decided to resign from the government, possibly following some newspaper stories about his private life at the weekend. Read more about Mr Crabb here.Leave campaignerJohn Whittingdale has left his post as culture secretary. The Leave campaigner was vice-chairman of the influential group of Tory MPs called the 1922 Committee until he took over the portfolio for culture, media and sport after the general election in 2015 from Sajid Javid.In a tweet, he said it had been ""a privilege"" to serve as culture secretary, and wished his successor ""every success"".  Leave campaignerTheresa Villiers steps down as Northern Ireland secretary, saying she declined an offer of another role from the new prime minister.Former barrister Ms Villiers, MP for Chipping Barnet, had held the Northern Ireland portfolio since 2012. Prior to that, she was a Member of the European Parliament for six years.In December 2005, Mr Cameron promoted her to shadow chief secretary to the Treasury. In 2007, she was made a shadow transport minister, a brief she continued to hold when the coalition came to power.She was among prominent figures who campaigned for Brexit. She said Mrs May had been ""kind enough to offer me a role"" but added that it was ""not one which I felt I could take on"".Read more about Ms Villiers here.Remain campaignerOliver Letwin has been sacked from his role as Cabinet Office minister and chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.The long-time MP started his political career as a policy adviser to Margaret Thatcher's government. After becoming elected an MP in 1997 he went on to serve in high profile shadow cabinet posts under then Tory-leader Michael Howard, including shadow home secretary and shadow chancellor.A mainstay of the Cameron years, he served as minister for government policy under the coalition government, and continued as a cabinet member following the 2015 general election.However, the 60-year-old may be better known by some for throwing parliamentary papers into a public bin in St James's Park and apologising for comments he made about black people days after the 1985 Broadwater Farm riot in north London. Remain campaignerChief Whip Mark Harper leaves his post to make way for David Cameron's former parliamentary private secretary Gavin Williamson.In a tweet, the MP for the Forest of Dean, who held the chief whip post for one year, said: ""I have decided to leave the Government & return to the backbenches. I'll continue to loyally support HMG & @theresa_may as our new PM."" Remain campaignerBaroness Stowell of Beeston moves aside as Leader of the House of Lords, to be succeeded by 40-year-old Baroness Evans.Of her successor, she tweeted: ""Baroness Evans will be a fantastic Leader of the House of Lords. She is a great woman. Congratulations and much love to Nats.""Nottingham-born Baroness Stowell was appointed to the Lords role in July 2014, having become a peer in 2011.Before taking up her peerage, she worked for the BBC, as a civil servant and ran William Hague's office when he was leader of the Conservative Party."

The most serious is trust - or lack of it. Labour insiders tell me they ""got Jeremy to the right place on nuclear"" - by not just committing to retaining the industry but also no longer opposing new capacity. Yet very few voters here in Whitehaven that I spoke to this morning believed him - and some were still unaware of his position. The second problem, though, is with Jeremy Corbyn himself. Even some left-wing MPs tell me his leadership came up completely unprompted on the doorsteps. So messenger and message aren't fully trusted. The third problem, though, is that while Labour is in opposition nationally - and Jeremy Corbyn says he will take on the political establishment - in areas which the party has controlled for decades it is seen as part of that establishment. Voter after voter said to me ""look at the town centre here"" - with pound shops, charity shops and bookies. ""Labour has done nothing for this area, we need new blood,"" said one. ""I am 80 and Labour has been in charge all that time - we need a change,"" said another. And that change was from the opposition to the government, standing conventional political wisdom on its head. "
2017-02-24,Lost hopes,https://web.archive.org//web/20170225020152/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-stoke-staffordshire-39054728,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkIn the wake of his victory, Stoke Central's new Labour MP Gareth Snell claimed it had been a triumph for the ""politics of hope"".But with the lowest turnout in the constituency's history and a margin of 2,620 the narrowest ever recorded in this once proud Labour heartland, can this declaration really be believed? It's a bright and windy day in Stoke-on-Trent. The town has been at the centre of the political spotlight for weeks now, but people seem more interested in discussing the aftermath of Storm Doris than the small matter of Stoke Central's by-election result. This staunch working class community was once passionately behind Labour. In 1951, more than 60,000 went to the polls - 34,260 backing Labour. Rather than feel victorious about Gareth Snell's win, Labour voters willing to talk simply seem relieved Paul Nuttall didn't clinch it. In all, 7,853 voted for Mr Snell, compared to 5,233 who wanted UKIP to win.Wendy Wright, 51, from Newcastle-under-Lyme, thought the vote for UKIP may have been higher had it not been for its disastrous campaign. ""I'm not surprised Labour won because of the way UKIP handled the campaign,"" she said. ""The people of Stoke seemed to think he [Paul Nuttall] didn't come from the area and they didn't believe his pack of lies. ""It's a relief UKIP didn't get in but [Labour retaining the seat] just means things are going to stay the same.""Ms Wright said there had not been a high turnout because ""people aren't interested in politics"".She said: ""They've kind of lost faith and lost hope. They think, what's the point, nothing's going to change.""It's a deprived area and it's a shame because the people are so welcoming and friendly.""Veronica Millington, 71, from Blythe Bridge, said she and husband Anthony, 75, were ""Labour through and through"".They backed Mr Snell in the by-election and also voted to stay in the European Union.""I think the people of Stoke do care about politics and they want to make things better,"" she said.""I think they were misled by UKIP in the beginning. They seemed to promise them so much and people saw it as a new chance really.""It was only when all the lies came out they saw how many wrong things had been said.""Mr Millington, 75, expressed concern about why so few people bothered to go to the polls. ""The turnout seemed to be very low and I think a lot of people think it was a foregone conclusion.""They thought the Labour Party would win. Now whether or not they've had a jolt from the outsider now, I don't know.""For a city that has had such a strong relationship with the Labour party, the changing political landscape over the past seven decades reveals a lot about the strength of feeling in the community. Labour has won all 18 elections since since the inception of the Stoke Central constituency, with the Conservatives coming second until 2001.But although Labour enjoyed a heyday in the 1960s and 70s, their share of the vote has consistently fallen over the years down to a record low of 37% in this by-election.So why did this city of proud, working class voters fall out of love with Labour?""Things started to change because of a growing alienation of the people of Stoke-on-Trent from Westminster,"" says Prof Mick Temple from Staffordshire University. ""Industry was decimated in the 1980s - coal, steel and the Potteries. ""When I first came here [in the early 90s] infrastructure was poor, schools were poor and still today, unemployment is higher than the national average.""From the closure of Shelton Steel Works - where 10,000 once worked - to the shrinking of its famous pottery industry, the people of Stoke-on-Trent have lived through some turbulent times. But the bleak images of derelict factories and houses often shown by the media are not a true reflection of the passion and pride of a community that is fiercely proud of its heritage. Data shows 6.2% of adults in Stoke Central claim unemployment benefit, far higher than the national average of 3.8%.In recent years employers such as Bet365, Michelin Tyres and Goodwin have invested millions of pounds into their businesses, providing jobs for thousands of people.Hanley's famous pottery industry is also enjoying something of a resurgence, with Emma Bridgewater investing more than £1m in its thriving ceramics factory.Middleport Pottery, home of world-famous Burleigh, is in the national spotlight thanks to the success of BBC Two's The Great Pottery Throw Down.  Millions of pounds are being spent regenerating the city.For many people though, the investment has been too little, too late. ""The feeling is that the city has been passed by Westminster and the EU, and that is why people voted Leave so overwhelmingly,"" says Prof Temple. ""There are many towns in the north of England where people feel the same - areas that are ripe for UKIP.""From 2005, the BNP and UKIP began to resonate with voters, coming fourth and fifth in that year's election and again in 2010. By 2015, UKIP had won so much support its candidate Mick Harold came second to Tristram Hunt for a seat that had the lowest voter turnout in the whole of the UK. Pub owner Tony Flackett, 69, backed Paul Nuttall in Thursday's poll.""It feels sad, it's such a shame, they've worked really hard and people have come from all over the country. ""I've always voted for Conservatives but the last two years I voted UKIP because of Brexit and immigration. ""But life goes on and at least they reduced the margin.""Tom Wilson, 26, voted for UKIP in the by-election and said he was ""very upset"" at the result.""I think Labour winning is very bad news for Stoke-on-Trent.""There has been years of neglect in Stoke with money spent only on Hanley.""I think only UKIP would have made a change for the people of Stoke.""UKIP has made moves to appeal to former Labour voters, as well as those who formerly backed the Tories.""They're more pro-State, pro-NHS. They recognise that strong nationalistic message supported by the working class,"" says Prof Temple.Between the 2001 and 2011 Censuses, the non-white population doubled and there was a relatively high population of Muslims, he said. ""I'm not saying the response was a racist one - Stoke-on-Trent was getting less and less money from the government and the EU and the feeling was the traditional working class community was being overtaken. ""Many working class voters felt they could not express their views within the Labour party. ""The BNP and UKIP gave them a chance to say how they felt.""Now Mr Snell is the town's new MP, the challenge is on for him to win back the trust of former Labour supporters and engage with new ones.Lee Woolrich, 33, from Stoke-on-Trent, is head of client services for a digital agency but did not vote in the by-election. ""I'm ashamed really that I didn't use my vote, but I almost don't think I invest enough in politics to make an informed decision,"" he said. ""I don't think young people are engaged in politics. I think they are more so recently because of what's happened in America.""I read about Paul Nuttall and some of his views and policies and I don't believe it's what we need here.""Mr Woolrich believes politicians need to take more of an interest in Stoke-on-Trent - he too feels the place has been forgotten and is badly represented by the media.""Stoke is doing great without those kinds of ideas. ""I love the developments in Hanley and the cultural quarter.""Stoke is showing signs of change and getting in line with cities like Manchester.""On a local level, I like the direction things are going in but I don't necessarily think government in London will listen to the people of Stoke. ""I hate that stigma that Stoke isn't a nice place to live. ""It doesn't do the place justice. It's a beautiful city steeped in history.""And Prof Temple agrees. ""It's a much more attractive place,"" he said. ""I've been here for 24 years, I've lived all around the world and this is the friendliest, most coherent community I've ever known. ""Stoke-on-Trent has an identity most places in the UK have lost. ""There's a very strong sense of community. It's a place where friendship and family is still strong."""

It has happened since 1878, but you could argue that those occasions had unusual circumstances that meant they were not comparable.Governing parties rarely look forward to by-elections, which tend to have relatively low turnouts and are seen as having less at stake that general elections.It is very rare for the governing party to pick up votes from the opposition. It is even rarer for them to gain a seat, as the Conservatives did when Trudy Harrison won Copeland in Cumbria.The constituency and its predecessor, Whitehaven, had returned Labour MPs since 1935.The Conservatives say this is ""the first time since 1878 that a governing party has made a comparable gain in a by-election"".The party was referring to the Worcester by-election 139 years ago, when they won the seat from the Liberals.Copeland is certainly not the first instance of a ruling party winning a seat at a by-election since that year, when Benjamin Disraeli was prime minister and women could not vote. That has happened several times since, but in unusual circumstances which are perhaps not ""comparable"" to Copeland.For example, in 1982 at the height of the Falklands War, a Labour MP defected to the Social Democratic Party in the south London seat of Mitcham and Morden.This split the left-of-centre vote, meaning the Conservative candidate won despite getting a smaller share of the vote than at the previous general election.A Conservative/National Liberal candidate won the Yorkshire seat of Brighouse and Spenborough from Labour in 1960, but that seat was very marginal. Labour won by just 47 votes at the 1959 general election, and lost by 666 a year later.In 1953, the governing Conservatives took Sunderland South from Labour, but this was also very close and the Conservative vote share fell slightly because a Liberal picked up some votes.Copeland was not nearly as tight as these examples, and the Conservatives increased their vote share substantially.Labour's Jamie Reed won the seat by more than 2,000 votes in 2015, while the new Conservative MP took it by a similar margin.The swing was 6.7%, a stunning result for a governing party.There are various other examples of government by-election gains since 1878.However, as Matt Singh of NumbrCrunchr Politics points out, these are ""mostly the product of freakish circumstances… none of which apply to Copeland"".Read more from Reality Check"
2017-02-24,France loves you,https://web.archive.org//web/20170225020152/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39049858,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkFor France's centrist presidential hopeful Emmanuel Macron this was the chance to engage close-up with thousands of expat voters.""French Londoners, France loves you,"" he told a rally, urging them to come home because their country needed their drive and expertise.He cited the frequently aired claim that London was France's sixth-largest city, with an estimated 200,000 French residents. In fact it would rank about 30th. But what drew Mr Macron to the UK was perhaps not so much the number as the type of French people living in its capital. Many are young, educated, upwardly and geographically mobile - exactly the constituency he has galvanised at home.Opinion polls suggest he has a chance of reaching the second-round presidential run-off in May and could even win the presidency.Queuing to hear him speak in Westminster on Tuesday was Elise Siouve, 25, a biotechnology postgraduate at Cambridge University, who felt Mr Macron ""understands the need to adapt to social and economic changes"".Another Cambridge student, Benjamin Vendrand-Maillet, 24, has set up a unit of Macron supporters at the university. For him, the centrist's market-friendly policies would work ""for all French people, whether rich or poor, young or old"" and he was best placed to defeat the populist Front National. The main challenge for French candidates campaigning abroad is that turnout is low among expats. In the UK, it is typically about 30%. Why bother to vote when you have decided to make another country your home?But Mr Macron could benefit from the UK's vote to leave the EU, which he deeply regrets. French residents who may suddenly be unsure of their long-term status in the UK could find renewed interest in politics back home. This is the case for Sylvie, a Macron fan who is studying for a doctorate in Oxford. ""I lost interest in France for four years because I found what was going on there dispiriting,"" she says. ""Since Brexit I've realised that I might have to go back to France, so I'm much more involved now."" Restating the message he had delivered to UK Prime Minister Theresa May earlier in the day, Mr Macron promised the crowd of about 2,000 that he would attract talent back to France by freeing up the economy and encouraging risk-taking and enterprise. He said he had been shocked when a French person he met on the Eurostar train to London had told him that he had gone to Britain to establish his start-up business because he had found it impossible to do so at home. ""What is at stake in this campaign,"" he said to loud applause, ""is making sure that women and men who are willing to create jobs and wealth, who want to change their own lives and that of others, can never say 'I tried to do it in France but it's better to do it a two-hour Eurostar ride away'. I don't want to hear that ever again."" Mr Macron is hoping to buck an international trend towards anti-globalisation populism in a country where market reforms have never been popular. The five-horse race for the French presidency remains wide open. In recent weeks polls have consistently placed far-right leader Marine Le Pen ahead in the first round on 23 April. But they have also suggested she would lose the run-off two weeks later. That suggests the top prize in this election could go to the initial runner-up.Mr Macron surged ahead of his rivals in January but his support has wobbled over the past week, following an outcry over his comment that the colonisation of Algeria had been a ""crime against humanity"". Mainstream conservative Francois Fillon appears to be staging a comeback after damaging allegations over payments to his wife. Two left-wing candidates are not far behind. But what is clear is that the winning candidate will be the one most able to mobilise his constituency - hence the potential importance of the expat vote in this race. ""It is too close to call,"" says Benedicte Paviot, London correspondent for France 24 television. ""French presidential candidates can't afford to ignore French nationals abroad."" "

The government's figures are for the situation after any appeals have been completed, so they depend on how accurately it has predicted their outcome.The government has produced tables showing how much business rates would rise or fall in the coming year, broken down by region of the country and type of business.The overall effect of all the changes comes to zero, which means that the policy is revenue neutral. But there is a key caveat at the bottom of the table, which is that the figures are: ""Before inflation and the adjustment to the multiplier for future appeal outcomes.""The inflation part is widely known. The measure of inflation used will become CPI (Consumer Price Index) instead of RPI (Retail Price Index), which will usually mean the increase is smaller, but that change will not happen until 2020. Increasing rates for RPI will add about 2% per year.But the other part is a bit more complicated - it is the adjustment required to make sure that the changes in rates are revenue neutral even after some businesses have appealed against the rated value of their premises and won. Analysis from the property consultants Gerald Eve suggested that the adjustment would be between four and five percentage points. They did that by working out how much business rates would change across the country to find out what adjustment would then be needed to make the policy revenue neutral again.They add that including both the inflation and the appeals adjustment means that business rates will fall in 135 of the 326 local authorities in England, not 259 as the government claimed. The Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) has strongly disputed suggestions that it has misled people with its figures, but has not disputed the suggestion that the appeals adjustment is between four and five percentage points.Speaking on the Today Programme, Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen said he thought the figures provided, ""might not be giving the picture that businesses in the real world are going to get when they get their bills"".This is certainly true. The DCLG has been clear that its figures are before inflation and the appeals adjustment.The government's figures are for the situation after any appeals have been completed, so they depend on how accurately it has predicted their outcome.Read more from Reality Check"
2017-02-24,Future of EU,https://web.archive.org//web/20170225020152/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39032192,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkMany Europeans eye the months ahead with foreboding. They see anti-establishment parties on the ascendancy. Angela Merkel - for so long Frau Europe - may lose power. And the financial markets are skittish over the possibility of a Marine Le Pen victory in France. Every edge up in her poll ratings sends bond yields rising.And yet an entirely different scenario may play out. It is quite possible that before the end of the year observers will declare that the Brexit-Trump tide has turned and that European integration has found new champions.First to the politics: in the Netherlands Geert Wilders has a history of under-performing at the polls. Even if he emerges as the leader of the largest party after the elections in March, he will struggle to get a foothold in government. The contest that preoccupies Europe's political class, however, is France. The conventional wisdom is that Marine Le Pen will win the first round in the presidential elections but be substantially defeated in round two. But France is on edge, gloomy and unsure of itself. She has expanded her lead in the polls and closed the gap on her most likely challenger in the second round, Emmanuel Macron. Still, he retains a 16% poll lead.But observers no longer trust the polls, and they fear the unforeseen event that could turn even more voters against governing elites.Yet if Marine Le Pen loses, as seems most likely, Europe could be facing an entirely different future. Currently the candidate most likely to win in France is Mr Macron. Yes, he's a novice: a man who has never been elected to high office. He has been drawing the crowds because he has sold himself as a new politician, neither left nor right.As the campaign gets under way, Marine Le Pen will be scathing, dismissing Mr Macron as an international banker, the epitome of the failed global elite, and the man who was Economy Minister under Francois Hollande. Mr Macron has yet to define himself, and he may yet stumble. But if he made it to the Elysee Palace, Europe and France would have a pro-European president, committed to the survival of the euro and the alliance with Germany.At the same time, Germany has grown more restless and more open to change. Some see Angela Merkel, who is hoping for a fourth term as chancellor, as weary and burnt-out. Some of her zeal for power has gone. And many Germans will forever blame her for allowing more than a million refugees into the country.Her main political opponent, the Social Democratic Party, has a new standard bearer in Martin Schulz. In the past month, the SPD has surged 12 points, even surpassing Mrs Merkel's Christian Democratic Union.Mr Schulz is a former President of the European Parliament. For a long time in German politics, he has been known as ""Mr Europe"". He has a good back-story: he's a former bookseller without a high school degree. He is a straight-talker, passionate about Europe and further integration. His greatest strength is his unbridled passion to succeed, his weakness is a love of power and some of its trappings, which he demonstrated in Brussels. He also may stumble, having not yet declared his policy on refugees. And never underestimate the appeal of Angela Merkel and her safe pair of hands. But the crowds are turning out for Mr Schulz, much as they have done for Mr Macron in France. If both men were to win, the outlook in Europe would change suddenly and dramatically.Both are European integrationists who would look to deepen and strengthen the European project. Together, they would breathe new life into the Franco-German relationship that has always been the engine room of the EU. Both, politicians from the centre-left, would loosen austerity further and favour spending on infrastructure projects to help countries such as Italy escape stagnation. There would be little generosity from either man towards Britain as it starts to negotiate its exit from the European Union. Mr Macron has said that it will be ""pretty tough"" on the UK and Mr Schulz would want to see the UK pays a price for its departure. As this European election season begins, no-one yet knows what the Trump effect will be on Europe. Will US President Donald Trump's victory encourage voters that they can support anti-immigration candidates who want powers returned to the nation states and, in the case of France, have a vote on membership of the European Union?Or will President Trump deter voters from taking further risks? Will voters turn away from the United States - whose president has openly discussed which country would leave the EU next - and incline towards building a Europe more confident in its own values and security? The President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, has said Europe wants the US's ""wholehearted and unequivocal support for the idea of a united Europe"". It may not be forthcoming, and the insecurity may yet prompt some voters to back deeper European integration rather the outsiders, the insurgents, the challengers.For Europe, the script for 2017 is a long way from being written and the outcome may yet surprise."

The veteran Gaullist already has form.When he was Commissioner for the Internal Market and Financial Services, Mr Barnier was dubbed ""the most dangerous man in Europe"" after taking on the banking sector and championing a cap on bankers' bonuses. But while he alarmed some in the City, and will probably do so again, he also won grudging respect as a tough but even-handed negotiator.He will need all those skills and more in his new role - chief Brexit negotiator at the European Commission. And having moved seamlessly between big jobs in Paris and Brussels - French foreign minister, Commissioner, MEP - he looks well prepared. ""Don't ask me to tell you what will be at the end of the road, we haven't begun to walk yet,"" he told a conference in Brussels last month. Mr Barnier will stick closely to the official EU position of ""no negotiation without notification"" - waiting for the UK to trigger Article 50 to start the formal process of withdrawal. But he's clearly eager to get going.""I am waiting to begin,"" he said. ""I will be ready tomorrow to negotiate, frankly speaking.""And he will bring with him an instinctive pro-European agenda, and a deep knowledge of the workings of the single market.His deputy as chief Brexit negotiator is a German trade expert, Sabine Weyand, adding to the impression that Mr Barnier will lead a team that means business.One of the biggest challenges he (and his boss Jean-Claude Juncker) faces, is to ensure that representatives of the big member states don't sideline him in the Brexit divorce negotiations.But Mr Barnier's long career in French politics means he could well have the ear of the Elysee Palace, especially if - as looks likely - a centre-right candidate wins the French presidency next year. The stakes are so high that there are bound to be some clashes.Mr Barnier has sparred with the UK's Minister for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, before, when the men both served as Europe ministers in the 1990s. It is another reminder that Michel Barnier is a politician first and foremost, rather than a bureaucrat. There have certainly been criticisms - a dash of vanity, a lack of attention to detail. His career has had plenty of downs as well as ups.But he will defend his European vision to the end, and the British government would do well not to underestimate him.At the height of the eurozone crisis, Mr Barnier always refused (politely) to do broadcast interviews in English.""One wrong word,"" he told me once with a smile, ""and we could move markets.""The next few years will be equally challenging."

Scotland voted 62% in favour of Remain.The conversation online was being driven overwhelmingly by pro-independence campaigners. But people who had supported ""Better Together"" during the Scottish referendum vote also spoke about the possibility of a break-away from the UK as a result of the vote over EU membership.  Perhaps the most significant was Scottish author JK Rowling who tweeted: ""Scotland will seek independence now. Cameron's legacy will be breaking up two unions. Neither needed to happen.""Many took to Twitter to express new or strengthened pro-independence feelings in the wake of the latest vote (Just as a reminder: a ""Yes"" vote in Scotland's 2014 referendum was for independence, while the winning ""No"" campaign backed staying in the UK).One old tweet from 2014's independence referendum gained new life on Friday.

Writing in the Sunday Mirror, he says the party could ""turn back the Tory tide"" if members worked together. Mr Corbyn is set to give a speech to the Scottish Labour conference in Perth on Sunday.Deputy party leader Tom Watson told delegates on Saturday that now is ""not the time"" for a leadership contest.The Conservatives won the parliamentary seat in Copeland from Labour in the first by-election gain by a sitting government in 35 years.Prime Minister Theresa May hailed the victory as ""astounding"", saying it showed her government was ""working for everyone"".In the other by-election this week, Labour retained its seat in Stoke-on-Trent Central, fending off competition from Ukip leader Paul Nuttall, who came second. Mr Corbyn said losing the seat in Cumbria - which had been held by the party for 80 years - was ""deeply disappointing"".He said: ""Labour's share of the vote in Copeland has been falling for 20 years and of course I take my share of responsibility.""We haven't done enough yet to rebuild trust with people who have been ripped off and sold out for decades and don't feel Labour represents them.""But he wants to remain leader and ""take our message of economic renewal and fairness to every part of Britain"". Mr Corbyn added: ""I was re-elected... five months ago with a bigger majority and I am determined to finish that job; to reconnect Labour with our working-class voters and values so we can win power to rebuild and transform Britain for the many, not just the few.""Mr Watson told party delegates on Saturday that he would not seek to ""sugar coat"" the loss in Copeland, but was not looking to oust the leader. ""All of us with leadership roles in the Labour party need to have a long hard look at ourselves at what's not working,"" he said. ""I have said it a lot recently - this is not the time for a leadership election, that issue was settled last year.""BBC political correspondent Carole Walker said Mr Corbyn's words were unlikely to reassure critics who fear they are heading for defeat at the general election under his leadership.  They include David Miliband, who lost out on the Labour leadership in 2010. The former foreign secretary told the Times the party is at its weakest point in half a century and that he was ""deeply concerned"" for its future.The leader of trade union Unison, Dave Prentis, separately told the Guardian the by-election loss was ""disastrous"" and called on Mr Corbyn to ""take responsibility"" for what happens next.Gerard Coyne, who is standing to replace Len McCluskey as general secretary of the Unite union, said there was ""no doubt"" Copeland had been a ""meltdown"" for Labour."

Max Hill, the independent reviewer of terrorism laws, told the Sunday Telegraph Islamists were targeting UK cities.He credited the effectiveness of the intelligence services in limiting the level of threat to Britain. Mr Hill pledged to review anti-terror measures over concerns about any infringements of freedom.Mr Hill, who successfully prosecuted the failed 21/7 bombers and the killers of Damilola Taylor, said the so-called Islamic State was planning ""indiscriminate attacks on innocent civilians of whatever race or colour"" in UK cities, close to the scale of Provisional IRA attacks of the 1970s. Speaking in his first interview since being appointed to his watchdog role, he said there were distinctions in the ""mindset"" of the IRA 40 years ago and those under IS now.But he added: ""I think the intensity and the potential frequency of serious plot planning... represents an enormous ongoing risk that none of us can ignore.""So I think that there is undoubtedly significant ongoing risk which is at least as great as the threat to London in the 1970s when the IRA were active on the mainland.""He highlighted the numbers of British people travelling to Iraq and Syria to fight for IS.""It's an enormous concern that large numbers - we know this means at least hundreds of British citizens who have left this country in order to fight - are now returning or may be about to return"".In his interview, he defended ministers over compensation to ex-Guantanamo Bay detainee Jamal al-Harith, who later carried out a suicide bomb attack in Iraq. Mr Hill said ministers who approved a reported £1m of compensation for al-Harith - formerly known as Ronald Fiddler - could not have known the man would later join IS. Al-Harith, 50 and from Manchester, was sent to Guantanamo Bay in 2002.Earlier this month, IS said he detonated a car bomb at an Iraqi army base in Tal Gaysum, south-west of Mosul.""[Ministers] are to be called to account if in error taxpayers' money is paid to an individual who actually represents a significant risk to our national security through terrorist activity here or abroad,"" said Mr Hill.""But they cannot be held to account for a risk that was simply not present, not visible, not detectable at the time of the payout."""

The tweeted extract prompted a strong response on social media including from Nicola Sturgeon.Scotland's first minister described Mr Khan's intervention as ""spectacularly ill-judged"".Using her Twitter handle, she said: ""It is an insult to all those Scots who support independence for reasons of inclusion & social justice - the antithesis of what he says.""Before taking to the conference stage, Mr Khan told BBC Scotland's political editor Brian Taylor ""of course I am not saying that the SNP are racists or bigots"".

2017-02-25,Diesel drivers should think hard - Grayling,https://web.archive.org//web/20170226050417/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-39088631,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe transport secretary has said drivers considering buying diesel cars should take a ""long, hard think"". Chris Grayling made the remarks to the Daily Mail, which said the government was considering a scrappage scheme for older diesel cars. Concerns over nitrogen dioxide (NO2) emissions from diesel vehicles have been raised in recent years. The Department for Transport said Mr Grayling was not telling people to stop buying diesel vehicles. It declined to comment on reports of a new scrappage scheme.According to statistics from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), NO2 is responsible for about 23,500 deaths in the UK each year. Concern over emissions increased when it emerged that 1.2 million Volkswagen diesel vehicles in Britain had been fitted with software to help cheat emissions tests. Mr Grayling told the Mail: ""People should take a long, hard think about what they need, about where they're going to be driving, and should make best endeavours to buy the least polluting vehicle they can.""I don't think diesel is going to disappear but someone who is buying a car to drive around a busy city may think about buying a low-emission vehicle rather than a diesel.""Greenpeace clean air campaigner Areeba Hamid said: ""It's a bit confusing. He's saying 'have a long and hard think about diesel' but in the same breath he's saying [diesel cars] won't disappear.""She said the government should deliver a strong message to the car industry and consumers by changing the taxation structure on diesel cars in the next Budget. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) chief executive Mike Hawes said: ""The biggest air quality gains will come by encouraging the uptake of the latest low emission vehicles, regardless of fuel type.""Steve Fowler from Auto Express magazine said the government should not ""penalise"" those who ""really have no alternative"" to using diesel. ""As much as battery cars, hybrid cars are improving, they're never going to be the greatest things for really long journeys and for things like towing, so diesel - for the moment - will always have a place,"" he said. ""And people living in rural areas - this is where the one size fits all thing doesn't work.""When guest editing BBC Radio 4's Today programme last December, Britain's chief medical officer, Professor Dame Sally Davies, said diesel cars should ""steadily be phased out"" in order to reduce deaths from air pollution.  London is one of the worst affected areas in the UK for air pollution, and the city's mayor Sadiq Khan has asked the government to adopt a £515m diesel scrappage scheme to help reduce emissions in the capital. Mr Khan has also said a £10 ""toxicity charge"" - which will target the most polluting older vehicles in the capital - will come into force on 23 October. A spokesman for the Department of Transport said the government was helping to tackle air quality by providing a further £290m to support electric vehicles. The spokesman added: ""We will update our air quality plans later this year to further improve the nation's air quality.""The Labour government ran a £300m scrappage scheme for both diesel and petrol cars between 2009 and 2010.

Mr Watson told delegates: ""All of us with leadership roles in the Labour Party need to have a long hard look at ourselves at what's not working.""I have said it a lot recently - this is not the time for a leadership election, that issue was settled last year.""Mr Miliband, who now works as the head of the International Rescue Committee in New York, said: ""I don't think this is just a repeat of the 1980s. ""We have to really understand the historic nature of the challenge that we have to face.""But when asked if he would come back to politics, he said: ""I honestly don't know what I am going to do.

PM Theresa May said the ""astounding"" victory there showed her government was ""working for everyone"".Trudy Harrison got 44.3% of the vote, increasing the Conservatives' vote share by more than 8%. She overturned a Labour majority of more than 2,564 to take the seat by 2,147 votes - a swing of more than 6%.The leader of trade union Unison, Dave Prentis, told the Guardian that the loss was ""disastrous"".""The blame for these results does not lie solely with Jeremy Corbyn, but he must take responsibility for what happens next,"" he said. Gerard Coyne, who is standing to become general secretary of the Unite union, said there was ""no doubt"" Copeland was a ""meltdown"" for Labour.Labour must ""face up"" to the ""disconnect"" between Westminster and ordinary Labour voters, he said. But he stopped short of calling on Mr Corbyn to step down, saying it was a matter for the party and its MPs.Mr Corbyn said Labour's ""message was not enough to win through in Copeland"" but he hailed victory in Stoke as a ""decisive rejection of UKIP's politics of division and dishonesty"". Behind Labour's 37.1% share of the vote in Stoke, UKIP took 24.7% to come second, narrowly beating the Conservatives on 24.4%. Both UKIP and the Tories did slightly better than in 2015."

It was other than good. It was not desired by the people of Scotland. It was a mistake. It was not needed. It would not put bread on the table. It was a hissing and a byword.Having thus denigrated constitutional politics, she proceeded to deliver a speech which dealt, very substantially, with….constitutional politics.A conundrum? Yes, but perhaps also a dose of realism. Thus far, Labour has spent the time since the 2014 referendum and indeed the 2016 version urging a return to the politics of equality, the politics of economic reform.Read more from BrianMs Dugdale has reaffirmed her party's opposition to a second referendum.She added that she was ready to ""step up and make the case for the union"" once again, if the SNP broke its vow to not hold another contest. The MSP argued that Labour's ""historic values can endure even under this greatest threat"" and that it will ""always put the people of this country first"". Ms Dugdale added: ""The Labour Party I lead will never support independence. ""It's not an escape from Tory rule, it's not an escape from Brexit, it's not an alternative, it's the same old song that the SNP has been singing for decades. ""It's time Nicola Sturgeon changed her tune.""I want the first minister of Scotland to focus on the Scottish NHS, on our economy and on our schools. I don't want a first minister whose priority is the constitution.""Ms Dugdale also used the speech to announce her party's campaign to create a new Scottish Child Benefit.The plan could see the monthly sum go up to £20 per child per month by 2020.She believed the move would help reverse the fall in the value of child benefit and send a strong message that Scotland would not allow hard working families to ""bear the brunt of Brexit"".Ms Dugdale highlighted a conference vote in favour of a People's Constitutional Convention to look at establishing a federal power plan for the UK.She said in the ""coming months"" she, former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown, and party representatives from Wales and the English regions would begin to set out ""how we will take this agenda forward together"". Ahead of Ms Dugdale's speech, Mr Watson told members gathered: ""All of us with leadership roles in the Labour Party need to have a long hard look at ourselves at what's not working. Seven years into a Tory government we should not be facing questions about whether we can retain seats we already hold.""Our job at the next general election is to gain over 100 seats - keeping what we have is supposed to be the easy bit and here in Scotland you have seen what happened when Labour's long standing supporters stop voting Labour.""We cannot afford to have that happening in England too.""London Mayor Sadiq Khan also spoke on the second day of the three-day conference.He was forced to clarify his views after using social media to indicate what he would be saying in his address.Mr Khan tweeted an extract which said: ""Now's not the time to play on people's fears.""Or to pit one part of our country - or one section of our society - against each other.""In that respect there's no difference between those who try to divide us on the basis of whether we're English or Scottish, and those who try to divide us on the basis of our background, race or religion.""That prompted reaction on social media including a response from First Minister Nicola Sturgeon who described Mr Khan's intervention as ""spectacularly ill-judged"".She added: ""It is an insult to all those Scots who support independence for reasons of inclusion & social justice - the antithesis of what he says.""

Mrs May said the success showed her party's broad appeal across England. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has insisted he will stay on after it won a separate by-election in Stoke Central.But one Labour MP has urged him to consider his position following the Copeland loss.On a visit to the constituency, Mrs May said newly elected MP Trudy Harrison had upset the odds in a seat held by Labour since the 1930s. Speaking in Millom, Mrs May told supporters: ""What we've seen from this victory is this truly is a government that's working for everyone and every part of the country - and that's the message that we bring here to Copeland and we'll take across the country.""She praised Mrs Harrison as ""such a fantastic candidate"", one who does not just talk about things, but who ""actually rolls up her sleeves and gets things done"".Labour had held both Stoke and Copeland since their creation but was forced to defend them when two former frontbenchers, Tristram Hunt and Jamie Reed, resigned as MPs.Copeland, created in 1983, and its predecessor constituency Whitehaven have returned Labour MPs since 1935.Mrs Harrison got 44.3% of the vote, increasing the Conservatives' vote share by more than 8%. She overturned a Labour majority of more than 2,564 to take the seat by 2,147 votes - a swing of more than 6%.Professor John Curtice, of Strathclyde University, said the Copeland result was the best by-election performance by a governing party in terms of the increase in its share of the vote since January 1966.In her victory speech, Mrs Harrison said: ""It's been very clear talking to people throughout this campaign that [Labour leader] Jeremy Corbyn doesn't represent them.By Norman Smith, assistant political editorTheresa May finds her grip on British politics hugely strengthened.For a governing party after seven years of austerity to be sweeping aside Labour in a heartland seat and to see their share of the vote increase in another is an extraordinary achievement.It will be taken by her supporters as a vindication of her hard-edged drive towards Brexit and her break with the more metropolitan politics of David Cameron.As for Labour, relief that it has at least repulsed the perceived threat of UKIP but its slow painful anguish under Jeremy Corbyn seems set to continue.In normal times, both by-elections should have raised barely a flicker of concern and while the slide in support may not ignite a further leadership challenge, the convictions of Mr Corbyn's critics that he is leading the party into the wilderness will only have been strengthened.""They want a party which is on the side of ordinary working people, which will respect the way we voted in the referendum and which will build a country which represents everyone. That's why they voted for me tonight.""Mr Corbyn said Labour's ""message was not enough to win through in Copeland"" but hailed victory in Stoke as a ""decisive rejection of UKIP's politics of division and dishonesty"". He added: ""Labour will go further to reconnect with voters and break with the failed political consensus.""But Labour MP John Woodcock, a critic of the leader, said as things stood the party was on course for a ""historic and catastrophic defeat"" at the next general election. In Stoke-on-Trent, UKIP had hoped to capitalise on voters' leanings towards Brexit - the area voted strongly to leave the EU in June.But in his victory speech, the new Labour MP Gareth Snell said voters had ""chosen the politics of hope over the politics of fear"".""This city will not allow ourselves to be defined by last year's referendum and we will not allow ourselves to be divided by the result,"" he said.Labour's share of the vote was 37% - slightly down on the 39.3% it got in 2015. UKIP got 24.7% of the vote and the Conservatives, who came a close third, 24.4% - both slightly higher than their 2015 vote shares.Speaking to journalists after the result, UKIP leader Mr Nuttall said his party's ""time would come"".""There's a lot more to come from us,"" he said. We are not going anywhere, I'm not going anywhere.""The by-election results mean the government's majority is now 12 - the same as it was immediately after the general election, as the Conservative's new Copeland seat makes up for the one they lost to the Lib Dems in the Richmond Park by-election.

Asked if he would fall on his sword following the defeat, he said: ""No. I was elected leader of this party - I'm proud to lead this party.""And later in Stoke, Mr Corbyn congratulated new incumbent Mr Snell, arguing that despite media attempts ""to write off"" the party, Labour had won with a message ""that hope triumphs over fear"".Asked by BBC Radio 4's Today programme if Mr Corbyn had been the problem in Copeland, Mr McDonnell said while he conceded there were ""mixed views on Jeremy"", the result was not about individuals and the Labour leader was not considering his position. ""He's never said that,"" he said.Labour's failure to retain Copeland for the first time since the seat was created highlights three interlinked problems for the party.The most serious is trust - or lack of it.Labour insiders tell me they ""got Jeremy to the right place on nuclear"" - by not just committing to retaining the industry but also no longer opposing new capacity.Yet very few voters here in Whitehaven that I spoke to this morning believed him - and some were still unaware of his position.

""Nurses, teaching assistants, care workers and ordinary people everywhere need a Labour government. Jeremy has to show he understands how to turn things around and deliver just that.""John Woodcock, Labour MP for Barrow, the neighbouring constituency to Copeland, said the defeat there showed the party was ""in trouble"".Asked if Labour could win the next general election, he told Today the party was ""actually on course to a historic and catastrophic defeat"".The MP said it would be ""counter-productive"" for him and other critics of Mr Corbyn to demand another leadership election when the outcome was likely to be another victory for Mr Corbyn.""Jeremy Corbyn is going to remain leader of the Labour Party unless he decides that he thinks that it is right to go,"" he said.Veteran Labour backbencher David Winnick said the Copeland result had been ""disastrous"" for the party and urged Mr Corbyn to consider his position.""The party is faced with the problem of a leader who is simply not acceptable to a large number of people who would normally vote Labour. That it is an obstacle and it would be wrong not to recognise that,"" he said.""It is now entirely up to Jeremy and those close to him to decide what is best in the interests not simply of the party but the people we are in politics to represent.""But political scientist Prof John Curtice, of Strathclyde University, told the BBC that even if Mr Corbyn were to go, unless a credible contender came forward, ""it's not entirely clear Labour's problem would be solved"".However, Ian Lavery, Labour's campaigns and elections chairman, insisted Mr Corbyn and his anti-nuclear stance in a constituency that relies on Sellafield's nuclear processing facility, was not the problem. He claimed the Labour leader was ""one of the most popular politicians in the country"".""The issues in Copeland weren't about Jeremy Corbyn,"" he told BBC2's Daily Politics. ""The issues in Copeland were about the jobs and the economy and the people are worried about this."""

The Electoral Commission has also launched a formal investigation into apparently missing documentation from the Lib Dems and late returns submitted by businessman Peter Harris, who campaigned against EU membership. It has also said it is examining possible discrepancies in paperwork submitted by the European Movement, Labour Leave, UKIP and Conservatives In. "

2017-02-25,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20170226050417/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThis article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide to the UK's vote to leave the European Union. It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 52% to 48%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who resigned on the day after losing the referendum. Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she says she will respect the will of the people. She has said ""Brexit means Brexit"" but there is still a lot of debate about what that will mean in practice especially on the two key issues of how British firms do business in the European Union and what curbs are brought in on the rights of European Union nationals to live and work in the UK. She set out more details of her negotiating hopes in her key speech on Brexit.The UK economy appears to have weathered the initial shock of the Brexit vote, although the value of the pound remains near a 30-year low, but opinion is sharply divided over the long-term effects of leaving the EU. Some major firms such as Easyjet and John Lewis have pointed out that the slump in sterling has increased their costs. Britain also lost its top AAA credit rating, meaning the cost of government borrowing will be higher. But share prices have recovered from a dramatic slump in value, with both the FTSE 100 and the broader FTSE 250 index, which includes more British-based businesses, trading higher than before the referendum. The Bank of England cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - a record low and the first cut since 2009 - after the vote and there has not been the economic slump or recession that some had predicted. The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it has to invoke an agreement called Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May has said she intends to trigger this process by the end of March 2017, meaning the UK will be expected to have left by the summer of 2019, depending on the precise timetable agreed during the negotiations. The government will also enact a Great Repeal Bill which will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. It is expected to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove.After a court battle, the UK's Supreme Court ruled in January that Parliament must be consulted before Article 50 is invoked. This is why a two line Brexit bill is currently making its way through Parliament. MPs have approved it after Labour MPs were told to support it. It has got through its first House of Lords debate with debate and votes on possible changes expected in the next week.Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These men - dubbed the Three Brexiteers - will play a central role in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although it will be Mrs May, as prime minister, who will have the final say. David Cameron's government did not do any emergency planning for Brexit ahead of the referendum and Mrs May has rejected calls to say what her negotiating goals are.Once Article 50 has been triggered, the UK will have two years to negotiate its withdrawal. But no one really knows how the Brexit process will work - Article 50 was only created in late 2009 and it has never been used. Former Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, now Chancellor, wanted Britain to remain in the EU, and he has suggested it could take up to six years for the UK to complete exit negotiations. The terms of Britain's exit will have to be agreed by 27 national parliaments, a process which could take some years, he has argued. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. The UK will continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making.Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Following Theresa May's Brexit recent speech we now know that the UK is not intending to stay in the EU's single market. Although there has been speculation for months about the issue, it would have meant the UK staying under the auspices of the European Court of Justice and having to allow unlimited EU immigration, under freedom of movement rules.Both sides want trade to continue after Brexit with the UK seeking a positive outcome for those who wish to trade goods and services"" - such as those in the City of London and wanting a ""comprehensive free trade deal"" giving the UK ""the greatest possible access"" to the single market. Mrs May says she wants the UK to reach a new customs union deal with the EU. A customs union is where countries agree not to impose tariffs on each others' goods and have a common tariff on goods coming in from elsewhere. The UK is currently part of the EU customs union but that stops the UK being able to do its own trade deals with other countries. Reality Check: How could customs union work?These terms have increasingly been used as debate focused on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people in order to maintain access to the EU single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result.The government has declined to give a firm guarantee about the status of EU nationals currently living in the UK, saying this is not possible without a reciprocal pledge from other EU members about the millions of British nationals living on the continent. EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, will be be able to stay, the chief civil servant at the Home Office has said. The rights of other EU nationals would be subject to negotiations on Brexit and the ""will of Parliament"", he added.A lot depends on the kind of deal the UK agrees with the EU. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions on EU nationals, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.Again, it depends on whether the UK government decides to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages. Citizens' Advice has reminded people their rights have not changed yet and asked anyone to contact them if they think they have been discriminated against following the Leave vote.Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested EU migrants who come to the UK as Brexit nears may not be given the right to stay. He has said there might have to be a cut-off point if there was a ""surge"" in new arrivals.People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote. The day-to-day spending impact is likely to be more significant. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it to remain at least 10% below where it was on 23 June, in the long term. This means imported goods will consequently get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have already been seen and the issue was most notably illustrated by the dispute between Tesco and Marmite's makers about whether prices would be put up or not in the stores.The latest UK inflation figures, for January, showed the CPI inflation rate rising to 1.8%, its highest level for two and a half years, with signs of more cost pressures set to feed through in the months to come.Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration.She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations. As mentioned above, the key issue is whether other EU nations will grant the UK access to the single market, if that is what it wants, while at the same time being allowed to restrict the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK.Mrs May has said she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. It is currently running at 330,000 a year, of which 184,000 are EU citizens, and 188,000 are from outside the EU - the figures include a 39,000 outflow of UK citizens.It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Liberal Democrats - who have just a handful of MPs - have vowed to halt Brexit and keep Britain in the EU if they were to win the next general election.Some commentators, including former House of Commons clerk Lord Lisvane, have argued that a further referendum would be needed to ratify whatever deal the UK hammers out with the EU, but there are few signs political leaders view this as a viable option.Yes. Theresa May has appeared keen to avoid a vote on her negotiating stance, to avoid having to give away her priorities, but Theresa May has said there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. It is worth mentioning that any deal also has to be agreed by the European Parliament - with British MEPs getting a chance to vote on it there.  While there could be limitations on British nationals' ability to live and work in EU countries, it seems unlikely they would want to deter tourists. There are many countries outside the European Economic Area, which includes the 28 EU nations plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway, that British citizens can visit for up to 90 days without needing a visa and it is possible that such arrangements could be negotiated with European countries.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. In theory, the government could, if it wanted, decide to change the colour, which is currently standardised for EU countries, says the BBC's Europe correspondent, Chris Morris.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketNo nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it is ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faces being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. A second independence referendum for the country is now ""highly likely"", she has said, although not in 2017. She has said she wants Scotland to stay in the single market and said Mrs May's decision to rule out the UK staying in the single market ""undoubtedly"" brings the referendum closer.Before his resignation Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said the impact in Northern Ireland would be ""very profound"" and that the whole island of Ireland should now be able to vote on reunification. But, speaking while she was still Northern Ireland Secretary, Theresa Villiers ruled out the call from Sinn Féin for a border poll, saying the circumstances in which one would be called did not exist. The land border is likely to be a key part of the Brexit talks. Theresa May said a priority for her would be negotiating a deal with the EU which allowed a common travel area between the UK and the Republic of Ireland.During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest. But his successor Theresa May has said she will keep it in place, at least for the current Parliament, which is due to last until 2020.So far there has been a cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. There are yet to be signs that rising inflation have worried the Bank of England  enough to consider raising interest rates.  But if that happened it would make mortgages and loans more expensive to repay - but would be good news for savers.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.Eurotunnel boss Jacques Gounon said last November the reintroduction of duty-free would be ""an incredible boost for my business"" but he later said  that remark had been ""light-hearted"". Erik Juul-Mortensen, president of the Tax Free World Association (TFWA) said after the referendum vote ""it is not possible to predict how Brexit will affect the duty free and travel retail industry, and it is wiser not to make assumptions about exactly what the impact will be.""  They are at the moment but no-one knows the longer term prospects for definite. The EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - is not an EU initiative. It was negotiated between countries within a group known as the European Economic Area, often simply referred to as the single market (plus Switzerland, which confusingly is not a member of the EEA, but has agreed access to the single market). Therefore, the future of Britons' EHIC cover could depend on whether the UK decided to sever ties with the EEA.Probably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report. In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two-thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.However, the UK government is committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, the UK government is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR. However, the EU has its own European Court of Justice, whose decisions are binding on EU institutions and member states.Its rulings have sometimes caused controversy in Britain and supporters of a Brexit have called for immediate legislation to curb its powers. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also cited sovereignty and democracy, and they wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Four of the biggest US banks have committed to helping maintain the City's position. But HSBC will move up to 1,000 jobs to Paris, the BBC understands. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Pest control firm Rentokil Initial says it could make £15m extra this year thanks to a weaker currency.Others are less optimistic. Hilary Jones, a director at UK cosmetics firm Lush said the company was ""terrified"" about the economic impact. She added that while the firm's Dorset factory would continue to produce goods for the UK market, products for the European market may be made at its new plant in Germany.Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After the Leave vote, the government will probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""As with most elements of the UK economy, not enough solid data has been published yet to accurately conclude the Brexit effect on house prices. Industry figures have pointed to ""uncertainty"" among buyers and sellers that could potentially change the housing market.So far, the most significant research has come from the respected Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which has published the conclusions of a survey of its members. This primarily records sentiment among surveyors.It found that house prices are expected to fall across the UK in the three months after the referendum vote. However, the dip in prices is only expected to persist over the 12 months from June in London and East Anglia, surveyors predict.House prices were already slowing in central London, owing to the fall-out from changes to stamp duty rules in April.Separate figures from property portal Rightmove suggested the average asking price of houses coming on to the market in England and Wales fell by 0.9%, or £2,647, in July compared with June. It said that agents had reported very few sales had fallen through as a result of the vote.Many potential first-time buyers would welcome a fall in house prices, with ownership among the young falling owing to affordability concerns. Investors in property, or those who have paid off a mortgage and hope to leave homes as inheritance would be unhappy with a long-term reduction in value.  Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law following the decision to leave the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" will not necessarily disappear overnight - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU means the UK will not be part of TTIP. It will have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Former Labour health secretary Lord Owen has said that because of TTIP (see answer above) the only way to protect the NHS from further privatisation was to get out of the EU."

A flurry of resignations in the run-up to the recent Brexit Bill forced the Labour leader to announce his fourth re-shuffle since taking charge.Four roles in particular have seen the greatest turnover, each with four MPs filling these positions since September 2015, when Mr Corbyn took charge. The latest re-shuffle puts newcomers Rebecca Long-Bailey and Christina Rees into two of these roles."
2017-02-25,Who's Who: Theresa May's cabinet,https://web.archive.org//web/20170226050417/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36785814,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkTheresa May is forming her new government after becoming Conservative prime minister. She is continuing to announce her full cabinet - but here's what we know so far. The list will be updated as new appointments are made. Campaigned to Remain in the European Union The former home secretary, 59, becomes the UK's second female prime minister in the wake of David Cameron's resignation after the EU referendum. She had previously served in the Home Office for more than six years. Theresa May: Full profileHow does May's cabinet compare to Cameron's?Campaigned to Leave the EUBoris Johnson succeeds Philip Hammond at the Foreign Office. The former London mayor headed the campaign for the UK to leave the European Union. He did not previously have a ministerial appointment in Mr Cameron's government but accepted an invitation to attend political cabinet. He was not running any department. Mr Johnson, 52, may be one of the best known politicians in the country but the move to foreign secretary is a big step up from his previous role.Read how the world has reacted.Leave campaignerDavid Davis has been appointed to the new cabinet position of secretary of state for exiting the European Union - or ""Brexit secretary"". A veteran Eurosceptic, he has previously held the positions of Conservative party chairman and shadow deputy prime minister. Between 2003 and 2008, he was the shadow home secretary under both Michael Howard and David Cameron. Mr Davis, 67, lost to David Cameron in the 2005 Tory leadership contest. Details about the new Brexit department are still emerging, but it is likely to take the lead in negotiating Britain's departure from the EU and unpicking the thousands of pages of EU rules written into UK law.Theresa May is reported to have ordered civil servants to find a building for the new department.Leave campaignerLiam Fox, 54, has taken on another newly created position as secretary of state for international trade. He was made secretary of state for defence in 2010 but resigned in 2011 over allegations he had given a close friend, lobbyist Adam Werritty, access to the Ministry of Defence and allowed him to join official trips overseas.Like Mr Davis he is a Eurosceptic who voted to leave the EU and he also stood unsuccessfully for the Conservative Party leadership in 2005.He stood again in the latest race to be leader but was eliminated in the first ballot after winning the support of just 16 MPs.Remain campaignerThe appointment to chief whip is a big step up for Gavin Williamson, according to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg.David Cameron's former parliamentary private secretary, he also served as parliamentary private secretary to transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin.The 40-year-old from North Yorkshire was elected MP for South Staffordshire in 2010. As chief whip, he will attend Cabinet meetings.Remain campaignerKaren Bradley takes over from the deposed John Whittingdale as Culture, Media and Sport Secretary. She had been working with Theresa May as a Home Office minister since 2014.She was first elected MP for Staffordshire Moorlands in May 2010.Her appointment comes two months after Mr Whittingdale and the BBC agreed a major overhaul of the corporation.Read more about her appointment here.Leave campaignerAndrea Leadsom, the Conservative leadership candidate who dramatically pulled out of the race, is the new Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Secretary.The prominent Brexit backer is promoted from energy minister to a cabinet role which will see her take responsibility for a farming industry as it faces the end of European Union subsidies. She will also have to fashion a post-Brexit fisheries policy. Green campaigners will be watching carefully to see what happens to environment regulations in areas including wildlife habitats, air pollution and water quality, currently governed by rules from Europe. Mrs Leadsom's public reason for withdrawing from the leadership race was to allow a rapid transition at the top, and give the economy certainty in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. But our political editor Laura Kuenssberg says her friends were saying she was alarmed by the level of scrutiny given to her comments on motherhood reported in the Times.Read more on Mrs Leadsom's motivations for stepping aside here.Baroness Evans of Bowes Park becomes leader of the House of Lords at 40, in her first ministerial role since being ennobled by David Cameron in 2014.She attended London's Henrietta Barnett School and Cambridge University before becoming deputy director of the Conservative research department, deputy director of the Policy Exchange think-tank and chief operating officer of the New Schools Network - the organisation which ran Michael Gove's free schools programme.Remain campaignerDamian Green is appointed the new Work and Pensions Secretary, taking over from Stephen Crabb, who earlier resigned.Mr Green served as an Immigration Minister and Justice Secretary in the coalition government but has been on the backbenches since 2014.Leave campaignerPriti Patel is the new International Development Secretary, a promotion from her role as employment minister which she's held for just a year.Ms Patel became MP for Witham in 2010 and joined the front bench as a Treasury minister in 2014.She is no stranger to controversy, having previously advocated bringing back the death penalty and was accused of ""divide and rule politics"" during the referendum campaign for claiming that ""biased"" immigration policy prevents curry chefs from outside the EU from working in the UK.On her appointment, she immediately faced calls to guarantee the UK's legal commitment to spending 0.7% of GDP on overseas aid.Remain campaignerGreg Clark is secretary of state of a newly-created ministry of business, energy and industrial strategy.His appointment spells the end for a department which put climate change at the top of the agenda.Just eight years after it was created by then-prime minister Gordon Brown, the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) is being merged into Mr Clark's new department and losing the ""climate change"" part of its name.Environmentalists immediately expressed concern that the reshaping of departments showed the government was downgrading climate change as a priority.But Richard Black, director of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU), said Mr Clark's move was ""an excellent appointment"", saying he ""understands climate change, and has written influential papers on the benefits of Britain developing a low-carbon economy"".Remain campaignerJames Brokenshire, who has been working with Theresa May at the Home Office - where he was immigration minister - has been made Northern Ireland Secretary.He takes over from Theresa Villiers, who resigned from the cabinet having been offered another role but saying it was not one ""which I felt I could take on"". Before entering parliament Mr Brokenshire was a partner at a large international law firm.From 2011 to 2015, he served as security minister at the Home Office with responsibility for domestic national security and counter terrorism. This included supporting the home secretary with oversight of the work of MI5 and the national police counter-terrorism network.His responsibilities also included the government's counter-terrorism strategy and he was part of the prime minister's ""extremism taskforce"". He also led negotiations with the Jordanian government to secure the deportation of the radical cleric Abu Qatada.Read more on his appointment here.Remain campaignerDavid Lidington, former Europe Minister, is promoted to Leader of the House. He had been Europe Minister since 2010 but moves across to a post involving the smooth running of the Commons. The Cambridge history graduate and father-of-four has been MP for Aylesbury since 1992. He previously worked for BP and mining firm Rio Tinto.Campaigned to Remain in the EUPhilip Hammond has been named chancellor of the exchequer. He was foreign secretary under David Cameron from 2014 to 2016, having previously served as defence secretary and transport secretary. He replaces George Osborne.Mr Hammond, 60, is seen at Westminster as the ultimate safe pair of hands. Sometimes mocked as ""box office Phil"" for what some see as his dull delivery, he forged a reputation in the shadow Treasury team as the Tories' public spending ""axeman"".He was seen as a Eurosceptic who spoke of withdrawal if the EU were not reformed, but was a Remain campaigner in the referendum. He now has the job of steering Britain's economy through the choppy post-Brexit waters.Read what Mr Hammond has to say on his first day in the job.Remain campaignerAmber Rudd has been made home secretary, filling the vacancy left by Mrs May. Ms Rudd was formerly energy and climate change secretary, a position she held for just one year.During the campaign for Remain in the EU referendum, she warned in a TV debate that she would not trust the new Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson to drive her home at the end of a night out.The former investment banker, venture capitalist, and financial journalist, aged 52, decided to enter politics in her 40s in order to get ""a grip on her life"". She quickly joined the fast track to the top after being elected to Parliament as MP for Hastings and Rye. She was seen as a protege of then Chancellor George Osborne, serving as his parliamentary private secretary before being promoted to junior minister at the Energy and Climate Change department in 2014. Remain campaignerLiz Truss moves from her role as secretary for environment, food and rural affairs to replace Michael Gove as justice secretary.A qualified management accountant, she became MP for South West Norfolk in 2010 and was appointed education minister in 2012.She was brought up in Yorkshire and attended Roundhay, a comprehensive school in Leeds, and went on to read philosophy, politics and economics at Merton College, Oxford.Socially liberal, the 40-year-old was a founder member of the free enterprise group of Conservative MPs arguing for more deregulation of the economy.Remain campaignerJustine Greening has said she is ""absolutely delighted"" to be made the new education secretary, taking over from Nicky Morgan. She was also appointed minister for women and equalities. Her new department will also take on higher and further education, skills and apprenticeships.Ms Greening leaves her international development secretary post, which she was promoted to in October 2011.MP for Putney since 2005, she became economic secretary to the Treasury after the 2010 election, succeeding Philip Hammond as transport secretary after he was promoted to defence secretary.At London's Pride day on 25 June, two days after the Brexit vote, the 47-year-old announced in a tweet she was in a same-sex relationship, saying ""I campaigned for Stronger In but sometimes you're better off out!"".Read more about what's awaiting Ms Greening at the education department.Leave campaignerChris Grayling, Theresa May's leadership campaign chief, has been appointed transport secretary. He was formerly Leader of the House.The most pressing jobs in his in-tray include dealing with the travel chaos caused by Southern Rail's disrupted services, the expansion of airport capacity in south-east England and high speed rail link, HS2.He's got some experience in this department, having served as shadow transport secretary from December 2005 to 2007.The Brexiteer had a surprisingly low-key, restrained referendum, largely refraining from ""blue-on-blue"" attacks. He was also one of the few Vote Leave spokesmen to share a platform with former UKIP leader Nigel Farage. Remain campaignerPatrick McLoughlin leaves his role as transport secretary to become Conservative Party chairman and chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.An MP since 1986, the former miner also served as chief whip, after being appointed to the role in David Cameron's first cabinet.As transport secretary, he was in charge of several large-scale projects including Crossrail and HS2. The 58-year-old said he was ""very pleased indeed"" with his new role.Remain campaignerSajid Javid is moved sideways from business secretary to secretary of the department for communities and local government.Mr Javid, considered a protege of former chancellor George Osborne's, held the culture secretary position before being appointed to the business role last year and is a former managing director of Deutsche Bank. The 46-year-old University of Exeter graduate stood on a ""joint ticket"" with Stephen Crabb for the leadership election, hoping to be chancellor if Mr Crabb had become PM.Remain campaignerMichael Fallon has kept his job at the Ministry of Defence - a position the 64-year-old has held since 2014.He was Conservative MP for Darlington from 1983 to 1992 - initially during Margaret Thatcher's time in Downing Street - and after leaving Parliament, he was later re-elected as MP for Sevenoaks in 1997.A former Conservative Party deputy chairman, he has previously served as energy and business minister, and before that secretary of state for business and enterprise.Seen as a safe pair of hands in Westminster, he described himself as a ""pretty reluctant Remainer"" after the EU referendum.Remain campaignerDespite earlier speculation, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt remains in his post.The 49-year-old was appointed culture secretary in David Cameron's first coalition government, a role he held for two years - including while London played host to the 2012 Olympic Games.He took over the health portfolio following a cabinet reshuffle in 2012, and described the appointment as the ""biggest privilege of my life"". Most recently, Mr Hunt has been locked in a battle with the British Medical Association over a new contract for junior doctors, which has led to a series of strikes.Remain campaignerDavid Mundell will continue as Secretary of State for Scotland.Mr Mundell, the only Scottish Conservative MP, said his focus was now on ""ensuring Scotland gets the best possible deal out of the EU negotiations"".Former prime minister David Cameron first appointed Mr Mundell to the post when he held his Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale seat for the third consecutive election in 2015.Remain campaignerMay's cabinet: Who's in and who's out? Alun Cairns, MP for the Vale of Glamorgan, remains in his cabinet role as secretary of state for Wales.He was appointed to the post just four months ago so there was little surprise that he will retain his position. The 45-year-old, who was born in Swansea and is a graduate of the University of Wales, Newport, was elected as MP for the Vale of Glamorgan in 2010. He worked in banking for a decade before his election to the Welsh Assembly. Remain campaignerGeorge Osborne has been fired as chancellor.He had been in the Treasury since 2010 - throughout David Cameron's tenure in Downing Street. He had also been first secretary of state since May 2015. A key ally of Mr Cameron, Mr Osborne tweeted it had been a ""privilege"" to be chancellor, adding: ""Others will judge - I hope I've left the economy in a better state than I found it.""Leave campaignerMichael Gove has been fired as justice secretary. The former Times journalist also served under David Cameron as education secretary in the coalition government, and as chief whip.He successfully campaigned for Brexit alongside Boris Johnson - but later withdrew his support for his colleague to be Conservative leader and prime minister, instead standing himself. He was eliminated in the final round of voting by MPs in third place.His surprise move to stand for the leadership and therefore to become prime minister effectively dashed Mr Johnson's hopes of running.Remain campaignerNicky Morgan is to leave her post as education secretary. The 43-year-old, who qualified as a lawyer, became an MP in 2010 and rose to the cabinet position of minister for women and equalities in 2013.London-born Ms Morgan replaced Michael Gove as education secretary in 2014. She reportedly considered standing in the Conservative leadership contest, but ultimately threw her support behind leave campaigner Mr Gove, despite campaigning for a Remain vote herself.In a tweet, she said she was ""disappointed"" not to be continuing her work in the education department, before congratulating her successor Justine Greening, saying she was ""committed to excellence in education"".Remain campaignerWork and Pensions Secretary Stephen Crabb has resigned from government ""in the best interests of my family"". He was one of the four contenders who lost out to Theresa May for the Conservative leadership.BBC political correspondent Vicki Young says it's not yet known whether Mr Crabb was offered a post he did not want or had just decided to resign from the government, possibly following some newspaper stories about his private life at the weekend. Read more about Mr Crabb here.Leave campaignerJohn Whittingdale has left his post as culture secretary. The Leave campaigner was vice-chairman of the influential group of Tory MPs called the 1922 Committee until he took over the portfolio for culture, media and sport after the general election in 2015 from Sajid Javid.In a tweet, he said it had been ""a privilege"" to serve as culture secretary, and wished his successor ""every success"".  Leave campaignerTheresa Villiers steps down as Northern Ireland secretary, saying she declined an offer of another role from the new prime minister.Former barrister Ms Villiers, MP for Chipping Barnet, had held the Northern Ireland portfolio since 2012. Prior to that, she was a Member of the European Parliament for six years.In December 2005, Mr Cameron promoted her to shadow chief secretary to the Treasury. In 2007, she was made a shadow transport minister, a brief she continued to hold when the coalition came to power.She was among prominent figures who campaigned for Brexit. She said Mrs May had been ""kind enough to offer me a role"" but added that it was ""not one which I felt I could take on"".Read more about Ms Villiers here.Remain campaignerOliver Letwin has been sacked from his role as Cabinet Office minister and chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.The long-time MP started his political career as a policy adviser to Margaret Thatcher's government. After becoming elected an MP in 1997 he went on to serve in high profile shadow cabinet posts under then Tory-leader Michael Howard, including shadow home secretary and shadow chancellor.A mainstay of the Cameron years, he served as minister for government policy under the coalition government, and continued as a cabinet member following the 2015 general election.However, the 60-year-old may be better known by some for throwing parliamentary papers into a public bin in St James's Park and apologising for comments he made about black people days after the 1985 Broadwater Farm riot in north London. Remain campaignerChief Whip Mark Harper leaves his post to make way for David Cameron's former parliamentary private secretary Gavin Williamson.In a tweet, the MP for the Forest of Dean, who held the chief whip post for one year, said: ""I have decided to leave the Government & return to the backbenches. I'll continue to loyally support HMG & @theresa_may as our new PM."" Remain campaignerBaroness Stowell of Beeston moves aside as Leader of the House of Lords, to be succeeded by 40-year-old Baroness Evans.Of her successor, she tweeted: ""Baroness Evans will be a fantastic Leader of the House of Lords. She is a great woman. Congratulations and much love to Nats.""Nottingham-born Baroness Stowell was appointed to the Lords role in July 2014, having become a peer in 2011.Before taking up her peerage, she worked for the BBC, as a civil servant and ran William Hague's office when he was leader of the Conservative Party."

The most serious is trust - or lack of it. Labour insiders tell me they ""got Jeremy to the right place on nuclear"" - by not just committing to retaining the industry but also no longer opposing new capacity. Yet very few voters here in Whitehaven that I spoke to this morning believed him - and some were still unaware of his position. The second problem, though, is with Jeremy Corbyn himself. Even some left-wing MPs tell me his leadership came up completely unprompted on the doorsteps. So messenger and message aren't fully trusted. The third problem, though, is that while Labour is in opposition nationally - and Jeremy Corbyn says he will take on the political establishment - in areas which the party has controlled for decades it is seen as part of that establishment. Voter after voter said to me ""look at the town centre here"" [pictured above] with pound shops, charity shops and bookies. ""Labour has done nothing for this area, we need new blood,"" said one. ""I am 80 and Labour has been in charge all that time - we need a change,"" said another. And that change was from the opposition to the government, standing conventional political wisdom on its head. "
2017-02-25,Lost hopes,https://web.archive.org//web/20170226050417/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-stoke-staffordshire-39054728,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkIn the wake of his victory, Stoke Central's new Labour MP Gareth Snell claimed it had been a triumph for the ""politics of hope"".But with the lowest turnout in the constituency's history and a margin of 2,620 the narrowest ever recorded in this once proud Labour heartland, can this declaration really be believed? It's a bright and windy day in Stoke-on-Trent. The town has been at the centre of the political spotlight for weeks now, but people seem more interested in discussing the aftermath of Storm Doris than the small matter of Stoke Central's by-election result. This staunch working class community was once passionately behind Labour. In 1951, more than 60,000 went to the polls - 34,260 backing Labour. Rather than feel victorious about Gareth Snell's win, Labour voters willing to talk simply seem relieved Paul Nuttall didn't clinch it. In all, 7,853 voted for Mr Snell, compared to 5,233 who wanted UKIP to win.Wendy Wright, 51, from Newcastle-under-Lyme, thought the vote for UKIP may have been higher had it not been for its disastrous campaign. ""I'm not surprised Labour won because of the way UKIP handled the campaign,"" she said. ""The people of Stoke seemed to think he [Paul Nuttall] didn't come from the area and they didn't believe his pack of lies. ""It's a relief UKIP didn't get in but [Labour retaining the seat] just means things are going to stay the same.""Ms Wright said there had not been a high turnout because ""people aren't interested in politics"".She said: ""They've kind of lost faith and lost hope. They think, what's the point, nothing's going to change.""It's a deprived area and it's a shame because the people are so welcoming and friendly.""Veronica Millington, 71, from Blythe Bridge, said she and husband Anthony, 75, were ""Labour through and through"".They backed Mr Snell in the by-election and also voted to stay in the European Union.""I think the people of Stoke do care about politics and they want to make things better,"" she said.""I think they were misled by UKIP in the beginning. They seemed to promise them so much and people saw it as a new chance really.""It was only when all the lies came out they saw how many wrong things had been said.""Mr Millington, 75, expressed concern about why so few people bothered to go to the polls. ""The turnout seemed to be very low and I think a lot of people think it was a foregone conclusion.""They thought the Labour Party would win. Now whether or not they've had a jolt from the outsider now, I don't know.""For a city that has had such a strong relationship with the Labour party, the changing political landscape over the past seven decades reveals a lot about the strength of feeling in the community. Labour has won all 18 elections since since the inception of the Stoke Central constituency, with the Conservatives coming second until 2001.But although Labour enjoyed a heyday in the 1960s and 70s, their share of the vote has consistently fallen over the years down to a record low of 37% in this by-election.So why did this city of proud, working class voters fall out of love with Labour?""Things started to change because of a growing alienation of the people of Stoke-on-Trent from Westminster,"" says Prof Mick Temple from Staffordshire University. ""Industry was decimated in the 1980s - coal, steel and the Potteries. ""When I first came here [in the early 90s] infrastructure was poor, schools were poor and still today, unemployment is higher than the national average.""From the closure of Shelton Steel Works - where 10,000 once worked - to the shrinking of its famous pottery industry, the people of Stoke-on-Trent have lived through some turbulent times. But the bleak images of derelict factories and houses often shown by the media are not a true reflection of the passion and pride of a community that is fiercely proud of its heritage. Data shows 6.2% of adults in Stoke Central claim unemployment benefit, far higher than the national average of 3.8%.In recent years employers such as Bet365, Michelin Tyres and Goodwin have invested millions of pounds into their businesses, providing jobs for thousands of people.Hanley's famous pottery industry is also enjoying something of a resurgence, with Emma Bridgewater investing more than £1m in its thriving ceramics factory.Middleport Pottery, home of world-famous Burleigh, is in the national spotlight thanks to the success of BBC Two's The Great Pottery Throw Down.  Millions of pounds are being spent regenerating the city.For many people though, the investment has been too little, too late. ""The feeling is that the city has been passed by Westminster and the EU, and that is why people voted Leave so overwhelmingly,"" says Prof Temple. ""There are many towns in the north of England where people feel the same - areas that are ripe for UKIP.""From 2005, the BNP and UKIP began to resonate with voters, coming fourth and fifth in that year's election and again in 2010. By 2015, UKIP had won so much support its candidate Mick Harold came second to Tristram Hunt for a seat that had the lowest voter turnout in the whole of the UK. Pub owner Tony Flackett, 69, backed Paul Nuttall in Thursday's poll.""It feels sad, it's such a shame, they've worked really hard and people have come from all over the country. ""I've always voted for Conservatives but the last two years I voted UKIP because of Brexit and immigration. ""But life goes on and at least they reduced the margin.""Tom Wilson, 26, voted for UKIP in the by-election and said he was ""very upset"" at the result.""I think Labour winning is very bad news for Stoke-on-Trent.""There has been years of neglect in Stoke with money spent only on Hanley.""I think only UKIP would have made a change for the people of Stoke.""UKIP has made moves to appeal to former Labour voters, as well as those who formerly backed the Tories.""They're more pro-State, pro-NHS. They recognise that strong nationalistic message supported by the working class,"" says Prof Temple.Between the 2001 and 2011 Censuses, the non-white population doubled and there was a relatively high population of Muslims, he said. ""I'm not saying the response was a racist one - Stoke-on-Trent was getting less and less money from the government and the EU and the feeling was the traditional working class community was being overtaken. ""Many working class voters felt they could not express their views within the Labour party. ""The BNP and UKIP gave them a chance to say how they felt.""Now Mr Snell is the town's new MP, the challenge is on for him to win back the trust of former Labour supporters and engage with new ones.Lee Woolrich, 33, from Stoke-on-Trent, is head of client services for a digital agency but did not vote in the by-election. ""I'm ashamed really that I didn't use my vote, but I almost don't think I invest enough in politics to make an informed decision,"" he said. ""I don't think young people are engaged in politics. I think they are more so recently because of what's happened in America.""I read about Paul Nuttall and some of his views and policies and I don't believe it's what we need here.""Mr Woolrich believes politicians need to take more of an interest in Stoke-on-Trent - he too feels the place has been forgotten and is badly represented by the media.""Stoke is doing great without those kinds of ideas. ""I love the developments in Hanley and the cultural quarter.""Stoke is showing signs of change and getting in line with cities like Manchester.""On a local level, I like the direction things are going in but I don't necessarily think government in London will listen to the people of Stoke. ""I hate that stigma that Stoke isn't a nice place to live. ""It doesn't do the place justice. It's a beautiful city steeped in history.""And Prof Temple agrees. ""It's a much more attractive place,"" he said. ""I've been here for 24 years, I've lived all around the world and this is the friendliest, most coherent community I've ever known. ""Stoke-on-Trent has an identity most places in the UK have lost. ""There's a very strong sense of community. It's a place where friendship and family is still strong."""

It has happened since 1878, but you could argue that those occasions had unusual circumstances that meant they were not comparable.Governing parties rarely look forward to by-elections, which tend to have relatively low turnouts and are seen as having less at stake than general elections.It is very rare for the governing party to pick up votes from the opposition. It is even rarer for them to gain a seat, as the Conservatives did when Trudy Harrison won Copeland in Cumbria.The constituency and its predecessor, Whitehaven, had returned Labour MPs since 1935.The Conservatives say this is ""the first time since 1878 that a governing party has made a comparable gain in a by-election"".The party was referring to the Worcester by-election 139 years ago, when they won the seat from the Liberals.Copeland is certainly not the first instance of a ruling party winning a seat at a by-election since that year, when Benjamin Disraeli was prime minister and women could not vote. That has happened several times since, but in unusual circumstances which are perhaps not ""comparable"" to Copeland.For example, in 1982 at the height of the Falklands War, a Labour MP defected to the Social Democratic Party in the south London seat of Mitcham and Morden.This split the left-of-centre vote, meaning the Conservative candidate won despite getting a smaller share of the vote than at the previous general election.A Conservative/National Liberal candidate won the Yorkshire seat of Brighouse and Spenborough from Labour in 1960, but that seat was very marginal. Labour won by just 47 votes at the 1959 general election, and lost by 666 a year later.In 1953, the governing Conservatives took Sunderland South from Labour, but this was also very close and the Conservative vote share fell slightly because a Liberal picked up some votes.Copeland was not nearly as tight as these examples, and the Conservatives increased their vote share substantially.Labour's Jamie Reed won the seat by more than 2,000 votes in 2015, while the new Conservative MP took it by a similar margin.The swing was 6.7%, a stunning result for a governing party.There are various other examples of government by-election gains since 1878.However, as Matt Singh of NumbrCrunchr Politics points out, these are ""mostly the product of freakish circumstances… none of which apply to Copeland"".Read more from Reality Check"

In fact it would rank about 30th. But what drew Mr Macron to the UK was perhaps not so much the number as the type of French people living in its capital. Many are young, educated, upwardly and geographically mobile - exactly the constituency he has galvanised at home.Opinion polls suggest he has a chance of reaching the second-round presidential run-off in May and could even win the presidency.Queuing to hear him speak in Westminster on Tuesday was Elise Siouve, 25, a biotechnology postgraduate at Cambridge University, who felt Mr Macron ""understands the need to adapt to social and economic changes"".Another Cambridge student, Benjamin Vendrand-Maillet, 24, has set up a unit of Macron supporters at the university. For him, the centrist's market-friendly policies would work ""for all French people, whether rich or poor, young or old"" and he was best placed to defeat the populist Front National. The main challenge for French candidates campaigning abroad is that turnout is low among expats. In the UK, it is typically about 30%. Why bother to vote when you have decided to make another country your home?But Mr Macron could benefit from the UK's vote to leave the EU, which he deeply regrets. French residents who may suddenly be unsure of their long-term status in the UK could find renewed interest in politics back home. This is the case for Sylvie, a Macron fan who is studying for a doctorate in Oxford. ""I lost interest in France for four years because I found what was going on there dispiriting,"" she says. ""Since Brexit I've realised that I might have to go back to France, so I'm much more involved now."" Restating the message he had delivered to UK Prime Minister Theresa May earlier in the day, Mr Macron promised the crowd of about 2,000 that he would attract talent back to France by freeing up the economy and encouraging risk-taking and enterprise. He said he had been shocked when a French person he met on the Eurostar train to London had told him that he had gone to Britain to establish his start-up business because he had found it impossible to do so at home. ""What is at stake in this campaign,"" he said to loud applause, ""is making sure that women and men who are willing to create jobs and wealth, who want to change their own lives and that of others, can never say 'I tried to do it in France but it's better to do it a two-hour Eurostar ride away'. I don't want to hear that ever again."" Mr Macron is hoping to buck an international trend towards anti-globalisation populism in a country where market reforms have never been popular. The five-horse race for the French presidency remains wide open. In recent weeks polls have consistently placed far-right leader Marine Le Pen ahead in the first round on 23 April. But they have also suggested she would lose the run-off two weeks later. That suggests the top prize in this election could go to the initial runner-up.Mr Macron surged ahead of his rivals in January but his support has wobbled over the past week, following an outcry over his comment that the colonisation of Algeria had been a ""crime against humanity"". Mainstream conservative Francois Fillon appears to be staging a comeback after damaging allegations over payments to his wife. Two left-wing candidates are not far behind. But what is clear is that the winning candidate will be the one most able to mobilise his constituency - hence the potential importance of the expat vote in this race. ""It is too close to call,"" says Benedicte Paviot, London correspondent for France 24 television. ""French presidential candidates can't afford to ignore French nationals abroad."" "
2017-02-25,Reality check,https://web.archive.org//web/20170226050417/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-39041300,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe claim: The government's figures on business rates are misleading because they exclude inflation and an appeals adjustment.Reality Check verdict: The figures do exclude both those things, but government publications specify that they do. The government's figures are for the situation after any appeals have been completed, so they depend on how accurately it has predicted their outcome.The government has produced tables showing how much business rates would rise or fall in the coming year, broken down by region of the country and type of business.The overall effect of all the changes comes to zero, which means that the policy is revenue neutral. But there is a key caveat at the bottom of the table, which is that the figures are: ""Before inflation and the adjustment to the multiplier for future appeal outcomes.""The inflation part is widely known. The measure of inflation used will become CPI (Consumer Price Index) instead of RPI (Retail Price Index), which will usually mean the increase is smaller, but that change will not happen until 2020. Increasing rates for RPI will add about 2% per year.But the other part is a bit more complicated - it is the adjustment required to make sure that the changes in rates are revenue neutral even after some businesses have appealed against the rated value of their premises and won. Analysis from the property consultants Gerald Eve suggested that the adjustment would be between four and five percentage points. They did that by working out how much business rates would change across the country to find out what adjustment would then be needed to make the policy revenue neutral again.They add that including both the inflation and the appeals adjustment means that business rates will fall in 135 of the 326 local authorities in England, not 259 as the government claimed. The Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) has strongly disputed suggestions that it has misled people with its figures, but has not disputed the suggestion that the appeals adjustment is between four and five percentage points.Speaking on the Today Programme, Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen said he thought the figures provided, ""might not be giving the picture that businesses in the real world are going to get when they get their bills"".This is certainly true. The DCLG has been clear that its figures are before inflation and the appeals adjustment.The government's figures are for the situation after any appeals have been completed, so they depend on how accurately it has predicted their outcome.Read more from Reality Check"
2017-02-25,Future of EU,https://web.archive.org//web/20170226050417/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39032192,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkMany Europeans eye the months ahead with foreboding. They see anti-establishment parties on the ascendancy. Angela Merkel - for so long Frau Europe - may lose power. And the financial markets are skittish over the possibility of a Marine Le Pen victory in France. Every edge up in her poll ratings sends bond yields rising.And yet an entirely different scenario may play out. It is quite possible that before the end of the year observers will declare that the Brexit-Trump tide has turned and that European integration has found new champions.First to the politics: in the Netherlands Geert Wilders has a history of under-performing at the polls. Even if he emerges as the leader of the largest party after the elections in March, he will struggle to get a foothold in government. The contest that preoccupies Europe's political class, however, is France. The conventional wisdom is that Marine Le Pen will win the first round in the presidential elections but be substantially defeated in round two. But France is on edge, gloomy and unsure of itself. She has expanded her lead in the polls and closed the gap on her most likely challenger in the second round, Emmanuel Macron. Still, he retains a 16% poll lead.But observers no longer trust the polls, and they fear the unforeseen event that could turn even more voters against governing elites.Yet if Marine Le Pen loses, as seems most likely, Europe could be facing an entirely different future. Currently the candidate most likely to win in France is Mr Macron. Yes, he's a novice: a man who has never been elected to high office. He has been drawing the crowds because he has sold himself as a new politician, neither left nor right.As the campaign gets under way, Marine Le Pen will be scathing, dismissing Mr Macron as an international banker, the epitome of the failed global elite, and the man who was Economy Minister under Francois Hollande. Mr Macron has yet to define himself, and he may yet stumble. But if he made it to the Elysee Palace, Europe and France would have a pro-European president, committed to the survival of the euro and the alliance with Germany.At the same time, Germany has grown more restless and more open to change. Some see Angela Merkel, who is hoping for a fourth term as chancellor, as weary and burnt-out. Some of her zeal for power has gone. And many Germans will forever blame her for allowing more than a million refugees into the country.Her main political opponent, the Social Democratic Party, has a new standard bearer in Martin Schulz. In the past month, the SPD has surged 12 points, even surpassing Mrs Merkel's Christian Democratic Union.Mr Schulz is a former President of the European Parliament. For a long time in German politics, he has been known as ""Mr Europe"". He has a good back-story: he's a former bookseller without a high school degree. He is a straight-talker, passionate about Europe and further integration. His greatest strength is his unbridled passion to succeed, his weakness is a love of power and some of its trappings, which he demonstrated in Brussels. He also may stumble, having not yet declared his policy on refugees. And never underestimate the appeal of Angela Merkel and her safe pair of hands. But the crowds are turning out for Mr Schulz, much as they have done for Mr Macron in France. If both men were to win, the outlook in Europe would change suddenly and dramatically.Both are European integrationists who would look to deepen and strengthen the European project. Together, they would breathe new life into the Franco-German relationship that has always been the engine room of the EU. Both, politicians from the centre-left, would loosen austerity further and favour spending on infrastructure projects to help countries such as Italy escape stagnation. There would be little generosity from either man towards Britain as it starts to negotiate its exit from the European Union. Mr Macron has said that it will be ""pretty tough"" on the UK and Mr Schulz would want to see the UK pays a price for its departure. As this European election season begins, no-one yet knows what the Trump effect will be on Europe. Will US President Donald Trump's victory encourage voters that they can support anti-immigration candidates who want powers returned to the nation states and, in the case of France, have a vote on membership of the European Union?Or will President Trump deter voters from taking further risks? Will voters turn away from the United States - whose president has openly discussed which country would leave the EU next - and incline towards building a Europe more confident in its own values and security? The President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, has said Europe wants the US's ""wholehearted and unequivocal support for the idea of a united Europe"". It may not be forthcoming, and the insecurity may yet prompt some voters to back deeper European integration rather the outsiders, the insurgents, the challengers.For Europe, the script for 2017 is a long way from being written and the outcome may yet surprise."

2017-02-25,Meet the EU's chief Brexit negotiator,https://web.archive.org//web/20170226050417/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37542204,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe British papers love a French villain at the heart of the EU.Is Michel Barnier about to succeed Jacques Delors as the object of their affection? The veteran Gaullist already has form.When he was Commissioner for the Internal Market and Financial Services, Mr Barnier was dubbed ""the most dangerous man in Europe"" after taking on the banking sector and championing a cap on bankers' bonuses. But while he alarmed some in the City, and will probably do so again, he also won grudging respect as a tough but even-handed negotiator.He will need all those skills and more in his new role - chief Brexit negotiator at the European Commission. And having moved seamlessly between big jobs in Paris and Brussels - French foreign minister, Commissioner, MEP - he looks well prepared. ""Don't ask me to tell you what will be at the end of the road, we haven't begun to walk yet,"" he told a conference in Brussels last month. Mr Barnier will stick closely to the official EU position of ""no negotiation without notification"" - waiting for the UK to trigger Article 50 to start the formal process of withdrawal. But he's clearly eager to get going.""I am waiting to begin,"" he said. ""I will be ready tomorrow to negotiate, frankly speaking.""And he will bring with him an instinctive pro-European agenda, and a deep knowledge of the workings of the single market.His deputy as chief Brexit negotiator is a German trade expert, Sabine Weyand, adding to the impression that Mr Barnier will lead a team that means business.One of the biggest challenges he (and his boss Jean-Claude Juncker) faces, is to ensure that representatives of the big member states don't sideline him in the Brexit divorce negotiations.But Mr Barnier's long career in French politics means he could well have the ear of the Elysee Palace, especially if - as looks likely - a centre-right candidate wins the French presidency next year. The stakes are so high that there are bound to be some clashes.Mr Barnier has sparred with the UK's Minister for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, before, when the men both served as Europe ministers in the 1990s. It is another reminder that Michel Barnier is a politician first and foremost, rather than a bureaucrat. There have certainly been criticisms - a dash of vanity, a lack of attention to detail. His career has had plenty of downs as well as ups.But he will defend his European vision to the end, and the British government would do well not to underestimate him.At the height of the eurozone crisis, Mr Barnier always refused (politely) to do broadcast interviews in English.""One wrong word,"" he told me once with a smile, ""and we could move markets.""The next few years will be equally challenging."

Scotland voted 62% in favour of Remain.The conversation online was being driven overwhelmingly by pro-independence campaigners. But people who had supported ""Better Together"" during the Scottish referendum vote also spoke about the possibility of a break-away from the UK as a result of the vote over EU membership.  Perhaps the most significant was Scottish author JK Rowling who tweeted: ""Scotland will seek independence now. Cameron's legacy will be breaking up two unions. Neither needed to happen.""Many took to Twitter to express new or strengthened pro-independence feelings in the wake of the latest vote (Just as a reminder: a ""Yes"" vote in Scotland's 2014 referendum was for independence, while the winning ""No"" campaign backed staying in the UK).One old tweet from 2014's independence referendum gained new life on Friday. Put out by the cross-party Better Together campaign, it reminded Scottish voters that the EU membership of an independent Scotland would be no sure thing:Blog by Mike WendlingNext story: Nigel Farage's wild nightAs the EU referendum vote swung decisively to Leave, perhaps nobody's fortunes changed more than UKIP leader Nigel Farage.

Former leader Ed Miliband said he was ""an outstanding servant of the Labour movement"", adding: ""His principles, values and friendship will be sorely missed.""A family spokesman confirmed he had been suffering from a long-term illness for several months. Sir Gerald became an MP in north-west England in 1970, first for the Manchester Ardwick constituency and then for Manchester Gorton, which he had served since 1983. He was a junior minister between 1974 and 1979, and held a number of senior shadow cabinet posts through the 1980s, before returning to the backbenches in the early 1990s.

The benefit is intended to help people cope with the extra costs of living with ill health or disability and are made according to the points a person scores in an assessment of their needs. In his BBC interview Mr Freeman said: ""These tweaks are actually about rolling back some bizarre decisions by tribunals that now mean benefits are being given to people who are taking pills at home, who suffer from anxiety,"" he said.""We want to make sure we get the money to the really disabled people who need it.""The Conservative MP for Mid Norfolk added that he and the prime minister ""totally"" understood anxiety. ""We've set out in the mental health strategy how seriously we take it,"" he added.After the interview, shadow chancellor John McDonnell tweeted: ""This is an insult to disabled people. (George Freeman) should apologise immediately or Theresa May should make him.""And Scope chief executive Mark Atkinson said: ""It is unhelpful to make crude distinctions between those with physical impairments and mental health issues because the kind of impairment someone has is not a good indicator of the costs they will face.""Many disabled people will now be anxiously waiting to hear as to whether or not these tighter rules will affect their current PIP award.""The government must offer clarity and reassurance that these new measures will not negatively affect the financial support that disabled people receive now or in the future, and that they stand by their commitment to making no further changes to disability benefits in this Parliament.""Disabilities minister Penny Mordaunt said she was reforming the PIP payments to ""restore the original aim of the benefit"" to make sure support was given to the most needy.Mr McDonnell said he was ""furious"" about the proposed changes to PIPS, and said Labour would pressurise the government to reverse them in next month's Budget.""Next week the Tories will make out that the economy and the public finances are doing better, however, they are planning to go ahead with a £3.7bn cut to the disabled,"" he said.The cuts would mean many people with severe disabilities ""are going to be trapped in their homes"", he added.The Liberal Democrats said the government was using court losses ""as an excuse to severely restrict disability benefits"".A DWP spokeswoman said the government was ""committed to ensuring our welfare system is a strong safety net for those who need it""."

Labour's deputy leader, Tom Watson, accused some of Mr Corbyn's ""cheerleaders"" of ""peeling away from him"" during a difficult time. While the party lost in Cumbria, the party managed to hold off a challenge from UKIP in a by-election, in Stoke-on-Trent Central, on Thursday.In his speech to the Scottish Labour Party conference in Perth, Mr Corbyn said: ""The policies and ideas we are setting out are policies whose time has come. But to win that fight we need to remain united.""But Mr Corbyn, Labour leader since 2015, said: ""The scale of how hard our task is to persuade people of our message was underlined just this week in Copeland.""Whilst we stood up to hatred and division in Stoke, I cannot lie and say the result in Copeland was what we wanted. But now is not the time to retreat, to run away or to give up.""Mr Corbyn called losing Copeland - which had been held by the party since its creation in 1983 - ""deeply disappointing"" and added that he took ""my share of responsibility"".Questioned about his future after the speech, Mr Corbyn said: ""I'm carrying on as leader because I'm determined that we will deliver social justice in this country.""Asked if he would still be in place in 2020, when the next general election is expected to take place, he replied: ""I've given you a very, very clear answer - yes."" Speaking on BBC One's Andrew Marr Show, Sir Patrick McLoughlin said: ""Copeland was a fantastic result for the prime minister.""He added: ""It shows that all seats are seats that we will look at, and we are going to challenge hard at the general election.""Meanwhile Tom Watson, told ITV1's Peston on Sunday the team who got Mr Corbyn elected for a second time ""seem to be peeling away from him"" and he queried where Unite union general secretary Len McCluskey was at this ""difficult time"".He said it should not just be up to him to defend Mr Corbyn, but a Unite spokesman said that as Labour's deputy leader it was ""his job to address the issues facing the party in the wake of the by-elections.""""Len McCluskey's job is to address the issues that are the foremost priorities for Unite's members,"" he added."
2017-02-26,Heseltine vows Lords Brexit rebellion,https://web.archive.org//web/20170227025508/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-39094090,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkSenior Tory Lord Heseltine has said he will rebel against the government when peers debate the bill giving Theresa May the authority to trigger Brexit.He said he would support an opposition amendment in the House of Lords demanding MPs get a meaningful vote on the deal reached with the EU.Writing in the Mail on Sunday, he denied this would be a ""confrontation"".But Home Secretary Amber Rudd told ITV's Peston on Sunday programme: ""I hope he will reconsider."" Last week peers gave an unopposed second reading to the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill, following a two-day debate involving more than 180 speakers.MPs have already backed the proposed law, authorising Prime Minister Theresa May to inform the EU of the UK's intention to leave.Opposition peers want to amend the bill at a later date to guarantee the rights of EU citizens in Britain and the role of Parliament in scrutinising the process.As the government does not have a majority in the Lords, it is vulnerable to being outvoted if opposition peers - including Labour's 202 and the 102 Lib Dems - join forces. Mrs May has said she wants to invoke Article 50 of the 2009 Lisbon Treaty - the formal two-year mechanism by which a member state must leave the EU - by the end of March, and the government has warned the House of Lords not to frustrate the process.Lord Heseltine wrote in the Mail on Sunday: ""The fightback starts here. My opponents will argue that the people have spoken, the [Brexit] mandate secured and the future cast. My experience stands against this argument.""He also wrote: ""This is not a confrontation with the government. It is to ensure the Commons can exercise its authority over the defining issue of our time.""The former deputy prime minister, whose leadership challenge to Margaret Thatcher helped trigger her exit from Number 10 in 1990, campaigned for Remain in the run-up to the referendum. He has been a long-standing supporter of the EU within the Conservative Party and backed the idea of the UK joining the single currency.Ms Rudd said: ""The fact is the House of Commons, which he was such a fantastic member of in his time, did pass it by a big majority ""I hope he will reconsider. There'll be plenty of opportunities to debate."" Labour backed the government in backing the bill in the Commons.In a speech to the Scottish Labour Party conference in Perth, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""I accept that Brexit has unleashed uncertainty, instability and concern amongst many, many people. But we cannot simply wish away the result.""Can you imagine the reaction from those 17 million people, including one million from Scotland, who voted to leave the European Union if we simply ignored them?""However, Gina Miller, the investment manager who brought the successful legal challenge against the government, forcing the Article 50 issue to a vote in Parliament, accused the Commons of ""cowardice"" in giving the bill a ""rubber stamp"".She told the Independent: ""I am hoping the Lords actually do what they should be doing constitutionally, exercising their parliamentary sovereignty, being independent, scrutinising the government and looking to put in amendments.""Appearing on BBC One's Andrew Marr Show, she also said: ""The will of the people does not negate the weight or wisdom of the Houses of Parliament.""But Conservative Party chairman Sir Patrick McLoughlin told the same programme: ""The bill got an overwhelming majority, one of the biggest majorities a bill has got on its third reading in the House of Commons and it's gone to the House of Lords. ""The prime minister has said that there will be a vote once the negotiations are concluded. The prime minister won't conclude the negotiations if she thinks she's got a bad deal.""The Leader of the House of Commons, David Lidington, told BBC Radio 4's The Westminster Hour: ""We'll listen, with respect as always, to the Lords when they debate the bill."" But he added that he hoped peers would not amend it, suggesting that to do so would go against the will of the people: ""I still hope that the Lords will, at the end of the day, accept that this bill is in a particular position, unusual position, because of the referendum result.""Richard Tice, co-chairman of the pro-Brexit Leave Means Leave campaign, said: ""It is of little surprise that Lord Heseltine - who has historically put the interests of the European Union ahead of those of Britain - will try to sabotage Article 50.""Lord Heseltine's attempt to weaken the position of the prime minister ahead of negotiations with the EU is a truly unpatriotic act."""

Peter Whittle said his party was ""more united than ever"" with a ""sense of renewed purpose"" despite failing to take Stoke-on-Trent Central from Labour in Thursday's by-election. Mr Nuttall said he was ""not going anywhere"" after the defeat. Mr Whittle told Andrew Marr he was currently ""on a trip he had booked"" beforehand.Labour held Stoke with 7,853 votes. Gareth Snell beat Mr Nuttall into second place on 5,233 votes.Mr Whittle said Mr Nuttall was taking time out after the ""gruelling time"" he had been through and the ""particularly personal"" attacks he experienced. The UKIP leader was criticised over fake claims he lost close friends in the Hillsborough tragedy and investigated by police over whether he spent time in the house he rented during the campaign to be elected as the local MP. Mr Whittle said of his leader: ""Without question, he has united the party. Of course it's disappointing that we didn't win in Stoke. But we are more united than ever, everything is more in place than ever and there's a real sense of renewed purpose.""Asked about a report in the Sunday Express that multi-millionaire UKIP donor Arron Banks had threatened to take his money elsewhere unless he was made chairman, Mr Whittle said the party already had a ""great, young, dynamic chairman"" in Paul Oakden. While he was ""always very grateful for Arron's contributions"", he added: ""If Arron were to take his money away, there are always other people... Obviously I wouldn't want that to happen.""Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage had said the Stoke seat was ""fundamental"" to the party's future, in a constituency where 69% of the electorate voted to leave at the EU at the referendum.Mr Whittle said Mr Nuttall had only been leader for 12 weeks at the time of the by-election and people ""hadn't got to know him well enough"".

Max Hill QC, the independent reviewer of terrorism laws, told the Sunday Telegraph that Islamist extremists were targeting UK cities.He credited the effectiveness of the intelligence services in limiting the level of threat to Britain. Home Secretary Amber Rudd told ITV's Peston on Sunday that defending the UK was her ""main priority"".Ms Rudd said she agreed with Mr Hill's assessment of the current terror threat facing the UK, adding that ensuring a country is well-defended is ""the most important job a home secretary does"".Mr Hill also pledged to review anti-terror measures over concerns about any infringements of freedom.Mr Hill, who successfully prosecuted the failed 21/7 bombers and the killers of Damilola Taylor, said the so-called Islamic State was planning ""indiscriminate attacks on innocent civilians of whatever race or colour"" in UK cities, close to the scale of Provisional IRA attacks of the 1970s. Speaking in his first interview since being appointed to his watchdog role, he said there were distinctions in the ""mindset"" of the IRA 40 years ago and those under IS now.But he added: ""I think the intensity and the potential frequency of serious plot planning... represents an enormous ongoing risk that none of us can ignore.""So I think that there is undoubtedly significant ongoing risk which is at least as great as the threat to London in the 1970s when the IRA were active on the mainland.""He highlighted the numbers of British people travelling to Iraq and Syria to fight for IS.""It's an enormous concern that large numbers - we know this means at least hundreds of British citizens who have left this country in order to fight - are now returning or may be about to return"".In his interview, he defended ministers over compensation to ex-Guantanamo Bay detainee Jamal al-Harith, who later carried out a suicide bomb attack in Iraq. Mr Hill said ministers who approved a reported £1m of compensation for al-Harith - a 50-year-old from Manchester formerly known as Ronald Fiddler - could not have known the man would later join IS. Earlier this month, IS said al-Harith - who was sent to Guantanamo Bay in 2002 - detonated a car bomb at an Iraqi army base in Tal Gaysum, south-west of Mosul.Al-Harith's family denied he received that sum, saying it was a group settlement split between him and three others.""[Ministers] are to be called to account if in error taxpayers' money is paid to an individual who actually represents a significant risk to our national security through terrorist activity here or abroad,"" said Mr Hill.""But they cannot be held to account for a risk that was simply not present, not visible, not detectable at the time of the payout."""

More than 12,000 operational ration packs (ORPs) were thrown away between April and December - more than in the previous 12 months.Work and Pensions Select Committee chairman Frank Field wants these surplus packs to feed the UK's homeless population.The Ministry of Defence says it only disposes of ORPs ""as a last resort"". Labour MP Mr Field submitted a written parliamentary question to defence minister Harriett Baldwin, who in response said the Ministry of Defence (MoD) threw away 12,275 ORPs between April and December.During the whole of the 2015/16 financial year 10,798 ORPs were disposed of, and 5,004 in the year before that.Mr Field said the issue had been repeatedly raised by food banks, because of problems associated with catering for people who cannot cook or store food.And he said he was ""staggered"" by the amount of food packages the MoD throws away.""The number is going up and they're only destroying it. I just hope someone will look into it. Let's move it from one army to the army of the homeless,"" he said. ""These supplies are designed for people, in a sense, to eat on the run, and people in doorways are in a similar position.""They're ideally constructed for when people haven't got much.""Out-of-date ORPs are withdrawn from use and disposed of according to current food safety legislation, Ms Baldwin said.An MoD spokesman added: ""Our stocks of ORPs are managed to make sure they are consumed within the two-year shelf life required to meet our food quality standards.""We only undertake disposal of ORP as a last resort and only at a point when the product can no longer be consumed.""Due to the changing nature of exercises or deployments, there will of course be occasions when ORP has not been issued before it becomes out of date."""

2017-02-26,Diesel drivers should think hard - Grayling,https://web.archive.org//web/20170227025508/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-39088631,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe transport secretary has said drivers considering buying diesel cars should take a ""long, hard think"". Chris Grayling made the remarks to the Daily Mail, which said the government was considering a scrappage scheme for older diesel cars. Concerns over nitrogen dioxide (NO2) emissions from diesel vehicles have been raised in recent years. The Department for Transport said Mr Grayling was not telling people to stop buying diesel vehicles. It declined to comment on reports of a new scrappage scheme.According to statistics from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), NO2 is responsible for about 23,500 deaths in the UK each year. Concern over emissions increased when it emerged that 1.2 million Volkswagen diesel vehicles in Britain had been fitted with software to help cheat emissions tests. Mr Grayling told the Mail: ""People should take a long, hard think about what they need, about where they're going to be driving, and should make best endeavours to buy the least polluting vehicle they can.""I don't think diesel is going to disappear but someone who is buying a car to drive around a busy city may think about buying a low-emission vehicle rather than a diesel.""Greenpeace clean air campaigner Areeba Hamid said: ""It's a bit confusing. He's saying 'have a long and hard think about diesel' but in the same breath he's saying [diesel cars] won't disappear.""She said the government should deliver a strong message to the car industry and consumers by changing the taxation structure on diesel cars in the next Budget. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) chief executive Mike Hawes said: ""The biggest air quality gains will come by encouraging the uptake of the latest low emission vehicles, regardless of fuel type.""Steve Fowler from Auto Express magazine said the government should not ""penalise"" those who ""really have no alternative"" to using diesel. ""As much as battery cars, hybrid cars are improving, they're never going to be the greatest things for really long journeys and for things like towing, so diesel - for the moment - will always have a place,"" he said. ""And people living in rural areas - this is where the one size fits all thing doesn't work.""When guest editing BBC Radio 4's Today programme last December, Britain's chief medical officer, Professor Dame Sally Davies, said diesel cars should ""steadily be phased out"" in order to reduce deaths from air pollution.  London is one of the worst affected areas in the UK for air pollution, and the city's mayor Sadiq Khan has asked the government to adopt a £515m diesel scrappage scheme to help reduce emissions in the capital. Mr Khan has also said a £10 ""toxicity charge"" - which will target the most polluting older vehicles in the capital - will come into force on 23 October. A spokesman for the Department of Transport said the government was helping to tackle air quality by providing a further £290m to support electric vehicles. The spokesman added: ""We will update our air quality plans later this year to further improve the nation's air quality.""The Labour government ran a £300m scrappage scheme for both diesel and petrol cars between 2009 and 2010.

2017-02-26,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20170227025508/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThis article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide to the UK's vote to leave the European Union. It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 52% to 48%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who resigned on the day after losing the referendum. Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she says she will respect the will of the people. She has said ""Brexit means Brexit"" but there is still a lot of debate about what that will mean in practice especially on the two key issues of how British firms do business in the European Union and what curbs are brought in on the rights of European Union nationals to live and work in the UK. She set out more details of her negotiating hopes in her key speech on Brexit.The UK economy appears to have weathered the initial shock of the Brexit vote, although the value of the pound remains near a 30-year low, but opinion is sharply divided over the long-term effects of leaving the EU. Some major firms such as Easyjet and John Lewis have pointed out that the slump in sterling has increased their costs. Britain also lost its top AAA credit rating, meaning the cost of government borrowing will be higher. But share prices have recovered from a dramatic slump in value, with both the FTSE 100 and the broader FTSE 250 index, which includes more British-based businesses, trading higher than before the referendum. The Bank of England cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - a record low and the first cut since 2009 - after the vote and there has not been the economic slump or recession that some had predicted. The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it has to invoke an agreement called Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May has said she intends to trigger this process by the end of March 2017, meaning the UK will be expected to have left by the summer of 2019, depending on the precise timetable agreed during the negotiations. The government will also enact a Great Repeal Bill which will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. It is expected to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove.After a court battle, the UK's Supreme Court ruled in January that Parliament must be consulted before Article 50 is invoked. This is why a two line Brexit bill is currently making its way through Parliament. MPs have approved it after Labour MPs were told to support it. It has got through its first House of Lords debate with debate and votes on possible changes expected in the next week.Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These men - dubbed the Three Brexiteers - will play a central role in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although it will be Mrs May, as prime minister, who will have the final say. David Cameron's government did not do any emergency planning for Brexit ahead of the referendum and Mrs May has rejected calls to say what her negotiating goals are.Once Article 50 has been triggered, the UK will have two years to negotiate its withdrawal. But no one really knows how the Brexit process will work - Article 50 was only created in late 2009 and it has never been used. Former Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, now Chancellor, wanted Britain to remain in the EU, and he has suggested it could take up to six years for the UK to complete exit negotiations. The terms of Britain's exit will have to be agreed by 27 national parliaments, a process which could take some years, he has argued. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. The UK will continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making.Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Following Theresa May's Brexit recent speech we now know that the UK is not intending to stay in the EU's single market. Although there has been speculation for months about the issue, it would have meant the UK staying under the auspices of the European Court of Justice and having to allow unlimited EU immigration, under freedom of movement rules.Both sides want trade to continue after Brexit with the UK seeking a positive outcome for those who wish to trade goods and services"" - such as those in the City of London and wanting a ""comprehensive free trade deal"" giving the UK ""the greatest possible access"" to the single market. Mrs May says she wants the UK to reach a new customs union deal with the EU. A customs union is where countries agree not to impose tariffs on each others' goods and have a common tariff on goods coming in from elsewhere. The UK is currently part of the EU customs union but that stops the UK being able to do its own trade deals with other countries. Reality Check: How could customs union work?These terms have increasingly been used as debate focused on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people in order to maintain access to the EU single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result.The government has declined to give a firm guarantee about the status of EU nationals currently living in the UK, saying this is not possible without a reciprocal pledge from other EU members about the millions of British nationals living on the continent. EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, will be be able to stay, the chief civil servant at the Home Office has said. The rights of other EU nationals would be subject to negotiations on Brexit and the ""will of Parliament"", he added.A lot depends on the kind of deal the UK agrees with the EU. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions on EU nationals, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.Again, it depends on whether the UK government decides to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages. Citizens' Advice has reminded people their rights have not changed yet and asked anyone to contact them if they think they have been discriminated against following the Leave vote.Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested EU migrants who come to the UK as Brexit nears may not be given the right to stay. He has said there might have to be a cut-off point if there was a ""surge"" in new arrivals.People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote. The day-to-day spending impact is likely to be more significant. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it to remain at least 10% below where it was on 23 June, in the long term. This means imported goods will consequently get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have already been seen and the issue was most notably illustrated by the dispute between Tesco and Marmite's makers about whether prices would be put up or not in the stores.The latest UK inflation figures, for January, showed the CPI inflation rate rising to 1.8%, its highest level for two and a half years, with signs of more cost pressures set to feed through in the months to come.Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration.She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations. As mentioned above, the key issue is whether other EU nations will grant the UK access to the single market, if that is what it wants, while at the same time being allowed to restrict the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK.Mrs May has said she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. It is currently running at 330,000 a year, of which 184,000 are EU citizens, and 188,000 are from outside the EU - the figures include a 39,000 outflow of UK citizens.It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Liberal Democrats - who have just a handful of MPs - have vowed to halt Brexit and keep Britain in the EU if they were to win the next general election.Some commentators, including former House of Commons clerk Lord Lisvane, have argued that a further referendum would be needed to ratify whatever deal the UK hammers out with the EU, but there are few signs political leaders view this as a viable option.Yes. Theresa May has appeared keen to avoid a vote on her negotiating stance, to avoid having to give away her priorities, but Theresa May has said there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. It is worth mentioning that any deal also has to be agreed by the European Parliament - with British MEPs getting a chance to vote on it there.  While there could be limitations on British nationals' ability to live and work in EU countries, it seems unlikely they would want to deter tourists. There are many countries outside the European Economic Area, which includes the 28 EU nations plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway, that British citizens can visit for up to 90 days without needing a visa and it is possible that such arrangements could be negotiated with European countries.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. In theory, the government could, if it wanted, decide to change the colour, which is currently standardised for EU countries, says the BBC's Europe correspondent, Chris Morris.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketNo nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it is ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faces being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. A second independence referendum for the country is now ""highly likely"", she has said, although not in 2017. She has said she wants Scotland to stay in the single market and said Mrs May's decision to rule out the UK staying in the single market ""undoubtedly"" brings the referendum closer.Before his resignation Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said the impact in Northern Ireland would be ""very profound"" and that the whole island of Ireland should now be able to vote on reunification. But, speaking while she was still Northern Ireland Secretary, Theresa Villiers ruled out the call from Sinn Féin for a border poll, saying the circumstances in which one would be called did not exist. The land border is likely to be a key part of the Brexit talks. Theresa May said a priority for her would be negotiating a deal with the EU which allowed a common travel area between the UK and the Republic of Ireland.During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest. But his successor Theresa May has said she will keep it in place, at least for the current Parliament, which is due to last until 2020.So far there has been a cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. There are yet to be signs that rising inflation have worried the Bank of England  enough to consider raising interest rates.  But if that happened it would make mortgages and loans more expensive to repay - but would be good news for savers.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.Eurotunnel boss Jacques Gounon said last November the reintroduction of duty-free would be ""an incredible boost for my business"" but he later said  that remark had been ""light-hearted"". Erik Juul-Mortensen, president of the Tax Free World Association (TFWA) said after the referendum vote ""it is not possible to predict how Brexit will affect the duty free and travel retail industry, and it is wiser not to make assumptions about exactly what the impact will be.""  They are at the moment but no-one knows the longer term prospects for definite. The EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - is not an EU initiative. It was negotiated between countries within a group known as the European Economic Area, often simply referred to as the single market (plus Switzerland, which confusingly is not a member of the EEA, but has agreed access to the single market). Therefore, the future of Britons' EHIC cover could depend on whether the UK decided to sever ties with the EEA.Probably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report. In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two-thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.However, the UK government is committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, the UK government is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR. However, the EU has its own European Court of Justice, whose decisions are binding on EU institutions and member states.Its rulings have sometimes caused controversy in Britain and supporters of a Brexit have called for immediate legislation to curb its powers. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also cited sovereignty and democracy, and they wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Four of the biggest US banks have committed to helping maintain the City's position. But HSBC will move up to 1,000 jobs to Paris, the BBC understands. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Pest control firm Rentokil Initial says it could make £15m extra this year thanks to a weaker currency.Others are less optimistic. Hilary Jones, a director at UK cosmetics firm Lush said the company was ""terrified"" about the economic impact. She added that while the firm's Dorset factory would continue to produce goods for the UK market, products for the European market may be made at its new plant in Germany.Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After the Leave vote, the government will probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""As with most elements of the UK economy, not enough solid data has been published yet to accurately conclude the Brexit effect on house prices. Industry figures have pointed to ""uncertainty"" among buyers and sellers that could potentially change the housing market.So far, the most significant research has come from the respected Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which has published the conclusions of a survey of its members. This primarily records sentiment among surveyors.It found that house prices are expected to fall across the UK in the three months after the referendum vote. However, the dip in prices is only expected to persist over the 12 months from June in London and East Anglia, surveyors predict.House prices were already slowing in central London, owing to the fall-out from changes to stamp duty rules in April.Separate figures from property portal Rightmove suggested the average asking price of houses coming on to the market in England and Wales fell by 0.9%, or £2,647, in July compared with June. It said that agents had reported very few sales had fallen through as a result of the vote.Many potential first-time buyers would welcome a fall in house prices, with ownership among the young falling owing to affordability concerns. Investors in property, or those who have paid off a mortgage and hope to leave homes as inheritance would be unhappy with a long-term reduction in value.  Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law following the decision to leave the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" will not necessarily disappear overnight - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU means the UK will not be part of TTIP. It will have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Former Labour health secretary Lord Owen has said that because of TTIP (see answer above) the only way to protect the NHS from further privatisation was to get out of the EU."

2017-02-26,Who's Who: Theresa May's cabinet,https://web.archive.org//web/20170227025508/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36785814,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkTheresa May is forming her new government after becoming Conservative prime minister. She is continuing to announce her full cabinet - but here's what we know so far. The list will be updated as new appointments are made. Campaigned to Remain in the European Union The former home secretary, 59, becomes the UK's second female prime minister in the wake of David Cameron's resignation after the EU referendum. She had previously served in the Home Office for more than six years. Theresa May: Full profileHow does May's cabinet compare to Cameron's?Campaigned to Leave the EUBoris Johnson succeeds Philip Hammond at the Foreign Office. The former London mayor headed the campaign for the UK to leave the European Union. He did not previously have a ministerial appointment in Mr Cameron's government but accepted an invitation to attend political cabinet. He was not running any department. Mr Johnson, 52, may be one of the best known politicians in the country but the move to foreign secretary is a big step up from his previous role.Read how the world has reacted.Leave campaignerDavid Davis has been appointed to the new cabinet position of secretary of state for exiting the European Union - or ""Brexit secretary"". A veteran Eurosceptic, he has previously held the positions of Conservative party chairman and shadow deputy prime minister. Between 2003 and 2008, he was the shadow home secretary under both Michael Howard and David Cameron. Mr Davis, 67, lost to David Cameron in the 2005 Tory leadership contest. Details about the new Brexit department are still emerging, but it is likely to take the lead in negotiating Britain's departure from the EU and unpicking the thousands of pages of EU rules written into UK law.Theresa May is reported to have ordered civil servants to find a building for the new department.Leave campaignerLiam Fox, 54, has taken on another newly created position as secretary of state for international trade. He was made secretary of state for defence in 2010 but resigned in 2011 over allegations he had given a close friend, lobbyist Adam Werritty, access to the Ministry of Defence and allowed him to join official trips overseas.Like Mr Davis he is a Eurosceptic who voted to leave the EU and he also stood unsuccessfully for the Conservative Party leadership in 2005.He stood again in the latest race to be leader but was eliminated in the first ballot after winning the support of just 16 MPs.Remain campaignerThe appointment to chief whip is a big step up for Gavin Williamson, according to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg.David Cameron's former parliamentary private secretary, he also served as parliamentary private secretary to transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin.The 40-year-old from North Yorkshire was elected MP for South Staffordshire in 2010. As chief whip, he will attend Cabinet meetings.Remain campaignerKaren Bradley takes over from the deposed John Whittingdale as Culture, Media and Sport Secretary. She had been working with Theresa May as a Home Office minister since 2014.She was first elected MP for Staffordshire Moorlands in May 2010.Her appointment comes two months after Mr Whittingdale and the BBC agreed a major overhaul of the corporation.Read more about her appointment here.Leave campaignerAndrea Leadsom, the Conservative leadership candidate who dramatically pulled out of the race, is the new Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Secretary.The prominent Brexit backer is promoted from energy minister to a cabinet role which will see her take responsibility for a farming industry as it faces the end of European Union subsidies. She will also have to fashion a post-Brexit fisheries policy. Green campaigners will be watching carefully to see what happens to environment regulations in areas including wildlife habitats, air pollution and water quality, currently governed by rules from Europe. Mrs Leadsom's public reason for withdrawing from the leadership race was to allow a rapid transition at the top, and give the economy certainty in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. But our political editor Laura Kuenssberg says her friends were saying she was alarmed by the level of scrutiny given to her comments on motherhood reported in the Times.Read more on Mrs Leadsom's motivations for stepping aside here.Baroness Evans of Bowes Park becomes leader of the House of Lords at 40, in her first ministerial role since being ennobled by David Cameron in 2014.She attended London's Henrietta Barnett School and Cambridge University before becoming deputy director of the Conservative research department, deputy director of the Policy Exchange think-tank and chief operating officer of the New Schools Network - the organisation which ran Michael Gove's free schools programme.Remain campaignerDamian Green is appointed the new Work and Pensions Secretary, taking over from Stephen Crabb, who earlier resigned.Mr Green served as an Immigration Minister and Justice Secretary in the coalition government but has been on the backbenches since 2014.Leave campaignerPriti Patel is the new International Development Secretary, a promotion from her role as employment minister which she's held for just a year.Ms Patel became MP for Witham in 2010 and joined the front bench as a Treasury minister in 2014.She is no stranger to controversy, having previously advocated bringing back the death penalty and was accused of ""divide and rule politics"" during the referendum campaign for claiming that ""biased"" immigration policy prevents curry chefs from outside the EU from working in the UK.On her appointment, she immediately faced calls to guarantee the UK's legal commitment to spending 0.7% of GDP on overseas aid.Remain campaignerGreg Clark is secretary of state of a newly-created ministry of business, energy and industrial strategy.His appointment spells the end for a department which put climate change at the top of the agenda.Just eight years after it was created by then-prime minister Gordon Brown, the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) is being merged into Mr Clark's new department and losing the ""climate change"" part of its name.Environmentalists immediately expressed concern that the reshaping of departments showed the government was downgrading climate change as a priority.But Richard Black, director of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU), said Mr Clark's move was ""an excellent appointment"", saying he ""understands climate change, and has written influential papers on the benefits of Britain developing a low-carbon economy"".Remain campaignerJames Brokenshire, who has been working with Theresa May at the Home Office - where he was immigration minister - has been made Northern Ireland Secretary.He takes over from Theresa Villiers, who resigned from the cabinet having been offered another role but saying it was not one ""which I felt I could take on"". Before entering parliament Mr Brokenshire was a partner at a large international law firm.From 2011 to 2015, he served as security minister at the Home Office with responsibility for domestic national security and counter terrorism. This included supporting the home secretary with oversight of the work of MI5 and the national police counter-terrorism network.His responsibilities also included the government's counter-terrorism strategy and he was part of the prime minister's ""extremism taskforce"". He also led negotiations with the Jordanian government to secure the deportation of the radical cleric Abu Qatada.Read more on his appointment here.Remain campaignerDavid Lidington, former Europe Minister, is promoted to Leader of the House. He had been Europe Minister since 2010 but moves across to a post involving the smooth running of the Commons. The Cambridge history graduate and father-of-four has been MP for Aylesbury since 1992. He previously worked for BP and mining firm Rio Tinto.Campaigned to Remain in the EUPhilip Hammond has been named chancellor of the exchequer. He was foreign secretary under David Cameron from 2014 to 2016, having previously served as defence secretary and transport secretary. He replaces George Osborne.Mr Hammond, 60, is seen at Westminster as the ultimate safe pair of hands. Sometimes mocked as ""box office Phil"" for what some see as his dull delivery, he forged a reputation in the shadow Treasury team as the Tories' public spending ""axeman"".He was seen as a Eurosceptic who spoke of withdrawal if the EU were not reformed, but was a Remain campaigner in the referendum. He now has the job of steering Britain's economy through the choppy post-Brexit waters.Read what Mr Hammond has to say on his first day in the job.Remain campaignerAmber Rudd has been made home secretary, filling the vacancy left by Mrs May. Ms Rudd was formerly energy and climate change secretary, a position she held for just one year.During the campaign for Remain in the EU referendum, she warned in a TV debate that she would not trust the new Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson to drive her home at the end of a night out.The former investment banker, venture capitalist, and financial journalist, aged 52, decided to enter politics in her 40s in order to get ""a grip on her life"". She quickly joined the fast track to the top after being elected to Parliament as MP for Hastings and Rye. She was seen as a protege of then Chancellor George Osborne, serving as his parliamentary private secretary before being promoted to junior minister at the Energy and Climate Change department in 2014. Remain campaignerLiz Truss moves from her role as secretary for environment, food and rural affairs to replace Michael Gove as justice secretary.A qualified management accountant, she became MP for South West Norfolk in 2010 and was appointed education minister in 2012.She was brought up in Yorkshire and attended Roundhay, a comprehensive school in Leeds, and went on to read philosophy, politics and economics at Merton College, Oxford.Socially liberal, the 40-year-old was a founder member of the free enterprise group of Conservative MPs arguing for more deregulation of the economy.Remain campaignerJustine Greening has said she is ""absolutely delighted"" to be made the new education secretary, taking over from Nicky Morgan. She was also appointed minister for women and equalities. Her new department will also take on higher and further education, skills and apprenticeships.Ms Greening leaves her international development secretary post, which she was promoted to in October 2011.MP for Putney since 2005, she became economic secretary to the Treasury after the 2010 election, succeeding Philip Hammond as transport secretary after he was promoted to defence secretary.At London's Pride day on 25 June, two days after the Brexit vote, the 47-year-old announced in a tweet she was in a same-sex relationship, saying ""I campaigned for Stronger In but sometimes you're better off out!"".Read more about what's awaiting Ms Greening at the education department.Leave campaignerChris Grayling, Theresa May's leadership campaign chief, has been appointed transport secretary. He was formerly Leader of the House.The most pressing jobs in his in-tray include dealing with the travel chaos caused by Southern Rail's disrupted services, the expansion of airport capacity in south-east England and high speed rail link, HS2.He's got some experience in this department, having served as shadow transport secretary from December 2005 to 2007.The Brexiteer had a surprisingly low-key, restrained referendum, largely refraining from ""blue-on-blue"" attacks. He was also one of the few Vote Leave spokesmen to share a platform with former UKIP leader Nigel Farage. Remain campaignerPatrick McLoughlin leaves his role as transport secretary to become Conservative Party chairman and chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.An MP since 1986, the former miner also served as chief whip, after being appointed to the role in David Cameron's first cabinet.As transport secretary, he was in charge of several large-scale projects including Crossrail and HS2. The 58-year-old said he was ""very pleased indeed"" with his new role.Remain campaignerSajid Javid is moved sideways from business secretary to secretary of the department for communities and local government.Mr Javid, considered a protege of former chancellor George Osborne's, held the culture secretary position before being appointed to the business role last year and is a former managing director of Deutsche Bank. The 46-year-old University of Exeter graduate stood on a ""joint ticket"" with Stephen Crabb for the leadership election, hoping to be chancellor if Mr Crabb had become PM.Remain campaignerMichael Fallon has kept his job at the Ministry of Defence - a position the 64-year-old has held since 2014.He was Conservative MP for Darlington from 1983 to 1992 - initially during Margaret Thatcher's time in Downing Street - and after leaving Parliament, he was later re-elected as MP for Sevenoaks in 1997.A former Conservative Party deputy chairman, he has previously served as energy and business minister, and before that secretary of state for business and enterprise.Seen as a safe pair of hands in Westminster, he described himself as a ""pretty reluctant Remainer"" after the EU referendum.Remain campaignerDespite earlier speculation, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt remains in his post.The 49-year-old was appointed culture secretary in David Cameron's first coalition government, a role he held for two years - including while London played host to the 2012 Olympic Games.He took over the health portfolio following a cabinet reshuffle in 2012, and described the appointment as the ""biggest privilege of my life"". Most recently, Mr Hunt has been locked in a battle with the British Medical Association over a new contract for junior doctors, which has led to a series of strikes.Remain campaignerDavid Mundell will continue as Secretary of State for Scotland.Mr Mundell, the only Scottish Conservative MP, said his focus was now on ""ensuring Scotland gets the best possible deal out of the EU negotiations"".Former prime minister David Cameron first appointed Mr Mundell to the post when he held his Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale seat for the third consecutive election in 2015.Remain campaignerMay's cabinet: Who's in and who's out? Alun Cairns, MP for the Vale of Glamorgan, remains in his cabinet role as secretary of state for Wales.He was appointed to the post just four months ago so there was little surprise that he will retain his position. The 45-year-old, who was born in Swansea and is a graduate of the University of Wales, Newport, was elected as MP for the Vale of Glamorgan in 2010. He worked in banking for a decade before his election to the Welsh Assembly. Remain campaignerGeorge Osborne has been fired as chancellor.He had been in the Treasury since 2010 - throughout David Cameron's tenure in Downing Street. He had also been first secretary of state since May 2015. A key ally of Mr Cameron, Mr Osborne tweeted it had been a ""privilege"" to be chancellor, adding: ""Others will judge - I hope I've left the economy in a better state than I found it.""Leave campaignerMichael Gove has been fired as justice secretary. The former Times journalist also served under David Cameron as education secretary in the coalition government, and as chief whip.He successfully campaigned for Brexit alongside Boris Johnson - but later withdrew his support for his colleague to be Conservative leader and prime minister, instead standing himself. He was eliminated in the final round of voting by MPs in third place.His surprise move to stand for the leadership and therefore to become prime minister effectively dashed Mr Johnson's hopes of running.Remain campaignerNicky Morgan is to leave her post as education secretary. The 43-year-old, who qualified as a lawyer, became an MP in 2010 and rose to the cabinet position of minister for women and equalities in 2013.London-born Ms Morgan replaced Michael Gove as education secretary in 2014. She reportedly considered standing in the Conservative leadership contest, but ultimately threw her support behind leave campaigner Mr Gove, despite campaigning for a Remain vote herself.In a tweet, she said she was ""disappointed"" not to be continuing her work in the education department, before congratulating her successor Justine Greening, saying she was ""committed to excellence in education"".Remain campaignerWork and Pensions Secretary Stephen Crabb has resigned from government ""in the best interests of my family"". He was one of the four contenders who lost out to Theresa May for the Conservative leadership.BBC political correspondent Vicki Young says it's not yet known whether Mr Crabb was offered a post he did not want or had just decided to resign from the government, possibly following some newspaper stories about his private life at the weekend. Read more about Mr Crabb here.Leave campaignerJohn Whittingdale has left his post as culture secretary. The Leave campaigner was vice-chairman of the influential group of Tory MPs called the 1922 Committee until he took over the portfolio for culture, media and sport after the general election in 2015 from Sajid Javid.In a tweet, he said it had been ""a privilege"" to serve as culture secretary, and wished his successor ""every success"".  Leave campaignerTheresa Villiers steps down as Northern Ireland secretary, saying she declined an offer of another role from the new prime minister.Former barrister Ms Villiers, MP for Chipping Barnet, had held the Northern Ireland portfolio since 2012. Prior to that, she was a Member of the European Parliament for six years.In December 2005, Mr Cameron promoted her to shadow chief secretary to the Treasury. In 2007, she was made a shadow transport minister, a brief she continued to hold when the coalition came to power.She was among prominent figures who campaigned for Brexit. She said Mrs May had been ""kind enough to offer me a role"" but added that it was ""not one which I felt I could take on"".Read more about Ms Villiers here.Remain campaignerOliver Letwin has been sacked from his role as Cabinet Office minister and chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.The long-time MP started his political career as a policy adviser to Margaret Thatcher's government. After becoming elected an MP in 1997 he went on to serve in high profile shadow cabinet posts under then Tory-leader Michael Howard, including shadow home secretary and shadow chancellor.A mainstay of the Cameron years, he served as minister for government policy under the coalition government, and continued as a cabinet member following the 2015 general election.However, the 60-year-old may be better known by some for throwing parliamentary papers into a public bin in St James's Park and apologising for comments he made about black people days after the 1985 Broadwater Farm riot in north London. Remain campaignerChief Whip Mark Harper leaves his post to make way for David Cameron's former parliamentary private secretary Gavin Williamson.In a tweet, the MP for the Forest of Dean, who held the chief whip post for one year, said: ""I have decided to leave the Government & return to the backbenches. I'll continue to loyally support HMG & @theresa_may as our new PM."" Remain campaignerBaroness Stowell of Beeston moves aside as Leader of the House of Lords, to be succeeded by 40-year-old Baroness Evans.Of her successor, she tweeted: ""Baroness Evans will be a fantastic Leader of the House of Lords. She is a great woman. Congratulations and much love to Nats.""Nottingham-born Baroness Stowell was appointed to the Lords role in July 2014, having become a peer in 2011.Before taking up her peerage, she worked for the BBC, as a civil servant and ran William Hague's office when he was leader of the Conservative Party."
2017-02-26,Labour problems,https://web.archive.org//web/20170227025508/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-39076233,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkLabour's failure to retain Copeland for the first time since the seat was created highlights three interlinked problems for the party. The most serious is trust - or lack of it. Labour insiders tell me they ""got Jeremy to the right place on nuclear"" - by not just committing to retaining the industry but also no longer opposing new capacity. Yet very few voters here in Whitehaven that I spoke to this morning believed him - and some were still unaware of his position. The second problem, though, is with Jeremy Corbyn himself. Even some left-wing MPs tell me his leadership came up completely unprompted on the doorsteps. So messenger and message aren't fully trusted. The third problem, though, is that while Labour is in opposition nationally - and Jeremy Corbyn says he will take on the political establishment - in areas which the party has controlled for decades it is seen as part of that establishment. Voter after voter said to me ""look at the town centre here"" [pictured above] with pound shops, charity shops and bookies. ""Labour has done nothing for this area, we need new blood,"" said one. ""I am 80 and Labour has been in charge all that time - we need a change,"" said another. And that change was from the opposition to the government, standing conventional political wisdom on its head. "
2017-02-26,Lost hopes,https://web.archive.org//web/20170227025508/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-stoke-staffordshire-39054728,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkIn the wake of his victory, Stoke Central's new Labour MP Gareth Snell claimed it had been a triumph for the ""politics of hope"".But with the lowest turnout in the constituency's history and a margin of 2,620 the narrowest ever recorded in this once proud Labour heartland, can this declaration really be believed? It's a bright and windy day in Stoke-on-Trent. The town has been at the centre of the political spotlight for weeks now, but people seem more interested in discussing the aftermath of Storm Doris than the small matter of Stoke Central's by-election result. This staunch working class community was once passionately behind Labour. In 1951, more than 60,000 went to the polls - 34,260 backing Labour. Rather than feel victorious about Gareth Snell's win, Labour voters willing to talk simply seem relieved Paul Nuttall didn't clinch it. In all, 7,853 voted for Mr Snell, compared to 5,233 who wanted UKIP to win.Wendy Wright, 51, from Newcastle-under-Lyme, thought the vote for UKIP may have been higher had it not been for its disastrous campaign. ""I'm not surprised Labour won because of the way UKIP handled the campaign,"" she said. ""The people of Stoke seemed to think he [Paul Nuttall] didn't come from the area and they didn't believe his pack of lies. ""It's a relief UKIP didn't get in but [Labour retaining the seat] just means things are going to stay the same.""Ms Wright said there had not been a high turnout because ""people aren't interested in politics"".She said: ""They've kind of lost faith and lost hope. They think, what's the point, nothing's going to change.""It's a deprived area and it's a shame because the people are so welcoming and friendly.""Veronica Millington, 71, from Blythe Bridge, said she and husband Anthony, 75, were ""Labour through and through"".They backed Mr Snell in the by-election and also voted to stay in the European Union.""I think the people of Stoke do care about politics and they want to make things better,"" she said.""I think they were misled by UKIP in the beginning. They seemed to promise them so much and people saw it as a new chance really.""It was only when all the lies came out they saw how many wrong things had been said.""Mr Millington, 75, expressed concern about why so few people bothered to go to the polls. ""The turnout seemed to be very low and I think a lot of people think it was a foregone conclusion.""They thought the Labour Party would win. Now whether or not they've had a jolt from the outsider now, I don't know.""For a city that has had such a strong relationship with the Labour party, the changing political landscape over the past seven decades reveals a lot about the strength of feeling in the community. Labour has won all 18 elections since since the inception of the Stoke Central constituency, with the Conservatives coming second until 2001.But although Labour enjoyed a heyday in the 1960s and 70s, their share of the vote has consistently fallen over the years down to a record low of 37% in this by-election.So why did this city of proud, working class voters fall out of love with Labour?""Things started to change because of a growing alienation of the people of Stoke-on-Trent from Westminster,"" says Prof Mick Temple from Staffordshire University. ""Industry was decimated in the 1980s - coal, steel and the Potteries. ""When I first came here [in the early 90s] infrastructure was poor, schools were poor and still today, unemployment is higher than the national average.""From the closure of Shelton Steel Works - where 10,000 once worked - to the shrinking of its famous pottery industry, the people of Stoke-on-Trent have lived through some turbulent times. But the bleak images of derelict factories and houses often shown by the media are not a true reflection of the passion and pride of a community that is fiercely proud of its heritage. Data shows 6.2% of adults in Stoke Central claim unemployment benefit, far higher than the national average of 3.8%.In recent years employers such as Bet365, Michelin Tyres and Goodwin have invested millions of pounds into their businesses, providing jobs for thousands of people.Hanley's famous pottery industry is also enjoying something of a resurgence, with Emma Bridgewater investing more than £1m in its thriving ceramics factory.Middleport Pottery, home of world-famous Burleigh, is in the national spotlight thanks to the success of BBC Two's The Great Pottery Throw Down.  Millions of pounds are being spent regenerating the city.For many people though, the investment has been too little, too late. ""The feeling is that the city has been passed by Westminster and the EU, and that is why people voted Leave so overwhelmingly,"" says Prof Temple. ""There are many towns in the north of England where people feel the same - areas that are ripe for UKIP.""From 2005, the BNP and UKIP began to resonate with voters, coming fourth and fifth in that year's election and again in 2010. By 2015, UKIP had won so much support its candidate Mick Harold came second to Tristram Hunt for a seat that had the lowest voter turnout in the whole of the UK. Pub owner Tony Flackett, 69, backed Paul Nuttall in Thursday's poll.""It feels sad, it's such a shame, they've worked really hard and people have come from all over the country. ""I've always voted for Conservatives but the last two years I voted UKIP because of Brexit and immigration. ""But life goes on and at least they reduced the margin.""Tom Wilson, 26, voted for UKIP in the by-election and said he was ""very upset"" at the result.""I think Labour winning is very bad news for Stoke-on-Trent.""There has been years of neglect in Stoke with money spent only on Hanley.""I think only UKIP would have made a change for the people of Stoke.""UKIP has made moves to appeal to former Labour voters, as well as those who formerly backed the Tories.""They're more pro-State, pro-NHS. They recognise that strong nationalistic message supported by the working class,"" says Prof Temple.Between the 2001 and 2011 Censuses, the non-white population doubled and there was a relatively high population of Muslims, he said. ""I'm not saying the response was a racist one - Stoke-on-Trent was getting less and less money from the government and the EU and the feeling was the traditional working class community was being overtaken. ""Many working class voters felt they could not express their views within the Labour party. ""The BNP and UKIP gave them a chance to say how they felt.""Now Mr Snell is the town's new MP, the challenge is on for him to win back the trust of former Labour supporters and engage with new ones.Lee Woolrich, 33, from Stoke-on-Trent, is head of client services for a digital agency but did not vote in the by-election. ""I'm ashamed really that I didn't use my vote, but I almost don't think I invest enough in politics to make an informed decision,"" he said. ""I don't think young people are engaged in politics. I think they are more so recently because of what's happened in America.""I read about Paul Nuttall and some of his views and policies and I don't believe it's what we need here.""Mr Woolrich believes politicians need to take more of an interest in Stoke-on-Trent - he too feels the place has been forgotten and is badly represented by the media.""Stoke is doing great without those kinds of ideas. ""I love the developments in Hanley and the cultural quarter.""Stoke is showing signs of change and getting in line with cities like Manchester.""On a local level, I like the direction things are going in but I don't necessarily think government in London will listen to the people of Stoke. ""I hate that stigma that Stoke isn't a nice place to live. ""It doesn't do the place justice. It's a beautiful city steeped in history.""And Prof Temple agrees. ""It's a much more attractive place,"" he said. ""I've been here for 24 years, I've lived all around the world and this is the friendliest, most coherent community I've ever known. ""Stoke-on-Trent has an identity most places in the UK have lost. ""There's a very strong sense of community. It's a place where friendship and family is still strong."""

It has happened since 1878, but you could argue that those occasions had unusual circumstances that meant they were not comparable.Governing parties rarely look forward to by-elections, which tend to have relatively low turnouts and are seen as having less at stake than general elections.It is very rare for the governing party to pick up votes from the opposition. It is even rarer for them to gain a seat, as the Conservatives did when Trudy Harrison won Copeland in Cumbria.The constituency and its predecessor, Whitehaven, had returned Labour MPs since 1935.The Conservatives say this is ""the first time since 1878 that a governing party has made a comparable gain in a by-election"".The party was referring to the Worcester by-election 139 years ago, when they won the seat from the Liberals.Copeland is certainly not the first instance of a ruling party winning a seat at a by-election since that year, when Benjamin Disraeli was prime minister and women could not vote. That has happened several times since, but in unusual circumstances which are perhaps not ""comparable"" to Copeland.For example, in 1982 at the height of the Falklands War, a Labour MP defected to the Social Democratic Party in the south London seat of Mitcham and Morden.This split the left-of-centre vote, meaning the Conservative candidate won despite getting a smaller share of the vote than at the previous general election.A Conservative/National Liberal candidate won the Yorkshire seat of Brighouse and Spenborough from Labour in 1960, but that seat was very marginal. Labour won by just 47 votes at the 1959 general election, and lost by 666 a year later.In 1953, the governing Conservatives took Sunderland South from Labour, but this was also very close and the Conservative vote share fell slightly because a Liberal picked up some votes.Copeland was not nearly as tight as these examples, and the Conservatives increased their vote share substantially.Labour's Jamie Reed won the seat by more than 2,000 votes in 2015, while the new Conservative MP took it by a similar margin.The swing was 6.7%, a stunning result for a governing party.There are various other examples of government by-election gains since 1878.However, as Matt Singh of NumbrCrunchr Politics points out, these are ""mostly the product of freakish circumstances… none of which apply to Copeland"".Read more from Reality Check"
2017-02-26,France loves you,https://web.archive.org//web/20170227025508/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39049858,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkFor France's centrist presidential hopeful Emmanuel Macron this was the chance to engage close-up with thousands of expat voters.""French Londoners, France loves you,"" he told a rally, urging them to come home because their country needed their drive and expertise.He cited the frequently aired claim that London was France's sixth-largest city, with an estimated 200,000 French residents. In fact it would rank about 30th. But what drew Mr Macron to the UK was perhaps not so much the number as the type of French people living in its capital. Many are young, educated, upwardly and geographically mobile - exactly the constituency he has galvanised at home.Opinion polls suggest he has a chance of reaching the second-round presidential run-off in May and could even win the presidency.Queuing to hear him speak in Westminster on Tuesday was Elise Siouve, 25, a biotechnology postgraduate at Cambridge University, who felt Mr Macron ""understands the need to adapt to social and economic changes"".Another Cambridge student, Benjamin Vendrand-Maillet, 24, has set up a unit of Macron supporters at the university. For him, the centrist's market-friendly policies would work ""for all French people, whether rich or poor, young or old"" and he was best placed to defeat the populist Front National. The main challenge for French candidates campaigning abroad is that turnout is low among expats. In the UK, it is typically about 30%. Why bother to vote when you have decided to make another country your home?But Mr Macron could benefit from the UK's vote to leave the EU, which he deeply regrets. French residents who may suddenly be unsure of their long-term status in the UK could find renewed interest in politics back home. This is the case for Sylvie, a Macron fan who is studying for a doctorate in Oxford. ""I lost interest in France for four years because I found what was going on there dispiriting,"" she says. ""Since Brexit I've realised that I might have to go back to France, so I'm much more involved now."" Restating the message he had delivered to UK Prime Minister Theresa May earlier in the day, Mr Macron promised the crowd of about 2,000 that he would attract talent back to France by freeing up the economy and encouraging risk-taking and enterprise. He said he had been shocked when a French person he met on the Eurostar train to London had told him that he had gone to Britain to establish his start-up business because he had found it impossible to do so at home. ""What is at stake in this campaign,"" he said to loud applause, ""is making sure that women and men who are willing to create jobs and wealth, who want to change their own lives and that of others, can never say 'I tried to do it in France but it's better to do it a two-hour Eurostar ride away'. I don't want to hear that ever again."" Mr Macron is hoping to buck an international trend towards anti-globalisation populism in a country where market reforms have never been popular. The five-horse race for the French presidency remains wide open. In recent weeks polls have consistently placed far-right leader Marine Le Pen ahead in the first round on 23 April. But they have also suggested she would lose the run-off two weeks later. That suggests the top prize in this election could go to the initial runner-up.Mr Macron surged ahead of his rivals in January but his support has wobbled over the past week, following an outcry over his comment that the colonisation of Algeria had been a ""crime against humanity"". Mainstream conservative Francois Fillon appears to be staging a comeback after damaging allegations over payments to his wife. Two left-wing candidates are not far behind. But what is clear is that the winning candidate will be the one most able to mobilise his constituency - hence the potential importance of the expat vote in this race. ""It is too close to call,"" says Benedicte Paviot, London correspondent for France 24 television. ""French presidential candidates can't afford to ignore French nationals abroad."" "

The government's figures are for the situation after any appeals have been completed, so they depend on how accurately it has predicted their outcome.The government has produced tables showing how much business rates would rise or fall in the coming year, broken down by region of the country and type of business.The overall effect of all the changes comes to zero, which means that the policy is revenue neutral. But there is a key caveat at the bottom of the table, which is that the figures are: ""Before inflation and the adjustment to the multiplier for future appeal outcomes.""The inflation part is widely known. The measure of inflation used will become CPI (Consumer Price Index) instead of RPI (Retail Price Index), which will usually mean the increase is smaller, but that change will not happen until 2020. Increasing rates for RPI will add about 2% per year.But the other part is a bit more complicated - it is the adjustment required to make sure that the changes in rates are revenue neutral even after some businesses have appealed against the rated value of their premises and won. Analysis from the property consultants Gerald Eve suggested that the adjustment would be between four and five percentage points. They did that by working out how much business rates would change across the country to find out what adjustment would then be needed to make the policy revenue neutral again.They add that including both the inflation and the appeals adjustment means that business rates will fall in 135 of the 326 local authorities in England, not 259 as the government claimed. The Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) has strongly disputed suggestions that it has misled people with its figures, but has not disputed the suggestion that the appeals adjustment is between four and five percentage points.Speaking on the Today Programme, Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen said he thought the figures provided, ""might not be giving the picture that businesses in the real world are going to get when they get their bills"".This is certainly true. The DCLG has been clear that its figures are before inflation and the appeals adjustment.The government's figures are for the situation after any appeals have been completed, so they depend on how accurately it has predicted their outcome.Read more from Reality Check"
2017-02-26,Future of EU,https://web.archive.org//web/20170227025508/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39032192,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkMany Europeans eye the months ahead with foreboding. They see anti-establishment parties on the ascendancy. Angela Merkel - for so long Frau Europe - may lose power. And the financial markets are skittish over the possibility of a Marine Le Pen victory in France. Every edge up in her poll ratings sends bond yields rising.And yet an entirely different scenario may play out. It is quite possible that before the end of the year observers will declare that the Brexit-Trump tide has turned and that European integration has found new champions.First to the politics: in the Netherlands Geert Wilders has a history of under-performing at the polls. Even if he emerges as the leader of the largest party after the elections in March, he will struggle to get a foothold in government. The contest that preoccupies Europe's political class, however, is France. The conventional wisdom is that Marine Le Pen will win the first round in the presidential elections but be substantially defeated in round two. But France is on edge, gloomy and unsure of itself. She has expanded her lead in the polls and closed the gap on her most likely challenger in the second round, Emmanuel Macron. Still, he retains a 16% poll lead.But observers no longer trust the polls, and they fear the unforeseen event that could turn even more voters against governing elites.Yet if Marine Le Pen loses, as seems most likely, Europe could be facing an entirely different future. Currently the candidate most likely to win in France is Mr Macron. Yes, he's a novice: a man who has never been elected to high office. He has been drawing the crowds because he has sold himself as a new politician, neither left nor right.As the campaign gets under way, Marine Le Pen will be scathing, dismissing Mr Macron as an international banker, the epitome of the failed global elite, and the man who was Economy Minister under Francois Hollande. Mr Macron has yet to define himself, and he may yet stumble. But if he made it to the Elysee Palace, Europe and France would have a pro-European president, committed to the survival of the euro and the alliance with Germany.At the same time, Germany has grown more restless and more open to change. Some see Angela Merkel, who is hoping for a fourth term as chancellor, as weary and burnt-out. Some of her zeal for power has gone. And many Germans will forever blame her for allowing more than a million refugees into the country.Her main political opponent, the Social Democratic Party, has a new standard bearer in Martin Schulz. In the past month, the SPD has surged 12 points, even surpassing Mrs Merkel's Christian Democratic Union.Mr Schulz is a former President of the European Parliament. For a long time in German politics, he has been known as ""Mr Europe"". He has a good back-story: he's a former bookseller without a high school degree. He is a straight-talker, passionate about Europe and further integration. His greatest strength is his unbridled passion to succeed, his weakness is a love of power and some of its trappings, which he demonstrated in Brussels. He also may stumble, having not yet declared his policy on refugees. And never underestimate the appeal of Angela Merkel and her safe pair of hands. But the crowds are turning out for Mr Schulz, much as they have done for Mr Macron in France. If both men were to win, the outlook in Europe would change suddenly and dramatically.Both are European integrationists who would look to deepen and strengthen the European project. Together, they would breathe new life into the Franco-German relationship that has always been the engine room of the EU. Both, politicians from the centre-left, would loosen austerity further and favour spending on infrastructure projects to help countries such as Italy escape stagnation. There would be little generosity from either man towards Britain as it starts to negotiate its exit from the European Union. Mr Macron has said that it will be ""pretty tough"" on the UK and Mr Schulz would want to see the UK pays a price for its departure. As this European election season begins, no-one yet knows what the Trump effect will be on Europe. Will US President Donald Trump's victory encourage voters that they can support anti-immigration candidates who want powers returned to the nation states and, in the case of France, have a vote on membership of the European Union?Or will President Trump deter voters from taking further risks? Will voters turn away from the United States - whose president has openly discussed which country would leave the EU next - and incline towards building a Europe more confident in its own values and security? The President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, has said Europe wants the US's ""wholehearted and unequivocal support for the idea of a united Europe"". It may not be forthcoming, and the insecurity may yet prompt some voters to back deeper European integration rather the outsiders, the insurgents, the challengers.For Europe, the script for 2017 is a long way from being written and the outcome may yet surprise."

2017-02-26,Meet the EU's chief Brexit negotiator,https://web.archive.org//web/20170227025508/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37542204,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe British papers love a French villain at the heart of the EU.Is Michel Barnier about to succeed Jacques Delors as the object of their affection? The veteran Gaullist already has form.When he was Commissioner for the Internal Market and Financial Services, Mr Barnier was dubbed ""the most dangerous man in Europe"" after taking on the banking sector and championing a cap on bankers' bonuses. But while he alarmed some in the City, and will probably do so again, he also won grudging respect as a tough but even-handed negotiator.He will need all those skills and more in his new role - chief Brexit negotiator at the European Commission. And having moved seamlessly between big jobs in Paris and Brussels - French foreign minister, Commissioner, MEP - he looks well prepared. ""Don't ask me to tell you what will be at the end of the road, we haven't begun to walk yet,"" he told a conference in Brussels last month. Mr Barnier will stick closely to the official EU position of ""no negotiation without notification"" - waiting for the UK to trigger Article 50 to start the formal process of withdrawal. But he's clearly eager to get going.""I am waiting to begin,"" he said. ""I will be ready tomorrow to negotiate, frankly speaking.""And he will bring with him an instinctive pro-European agenda, and a deep knowledge of the workings of the single market.His deputy as chief Brexit negotiator is a German trade expert, Sabine Weyand, adding to the impression that Mr Barnier will lead a team that means business.One of the biggest challenges he (and his boss Jean-Claude Juncker) faces, is to ensure that representatives of the big member states don't sideline him in the Brexit divorce negotiations.But Mr Barnier's long career in French politics means he could well have the ear of the Elysee Palace, especially if - as looks likely - a centre-right candidate wins the French presidency next year. The stakes are so high that there are bound to be some clashes.Mr Barnier has sparred with the UK's Minister for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, before, when the men both served as Europe ministers in the 1990s. It is another reminder that Michel Barnier is a politician first and foremost, rather than a bureaucrat. There have certainly been criticisms - a dash of vanity, a lack of attention to detail. His career has had plenty of downs as well as ups.But he will defend his European vision to the end, and the British government would do well not to underestimate him.At the height of the eurozone crisis, Mr Barnier always refused (politely) to do broadcast interviews in English.""One wrong word,"" he told me once with a smile, ""and we could move markets.""The next few years will be equally challenging."

Scotland voted 62% in favour of Remain.The conversation online was being driven overwhelmingly by pro-independence campaigners. But people who had supported ""Better Together"" during the Scottish referendum vote also spoke about the possibility of a break-away from the UK as a result of the vote over EU membership.  Perhaps the most significant was Scottish author JK Rowling who tweeted: ""Scotland will seek independence now. Cameron's legacy will be breaking up two unions. Neither needed to happen.""Many took to Twitter to express new or strengthened pro-independence feelings in the wake of the latest vote (Just as a reminder: a ""Yes"" vote in Scotland's 2014 referendum was for independence, while the winning ""No"" campaign backed staying in the UK).One old tweet from 2014's independence referendum gained new life on Friday. Put out by the cross-party Better Together campaign, it reminded Scottish voters that the EU membership of an independent Scotland would be no sure thing:Blog by Mike WendlingNext story: Nigel Farage's wild nightAs the EU referendum vote swung decisively to Leave, perhaps nobody's fortunes changed more than UKIP leader Nigel Farage.

For Theresa May, also an unflashy leader who was propelled to No 10 by a surprising political moment, Europe will be defining in a way no others could even have anticipated.In Sir John's carefully calibrated speech, there are plenty of messages for her, some of which may be welcome, some not. First off, having campaigned to stay in the European Union, with sober warnings particularly about the consequences for the Northern Irish peace process, it's no surprise that Sir John says that in his view, Brexit will be a ""historic mistake"".It is notable, although again not surprising, that he cautions that the UK will be a diminished diplomatic force in the world after we walk away from the EU, with a warning too that we will be less useful to our most important ally, the US, as a consequence.Also, even as the PM who lived through the Commons trauma of trying to deliver the Maastricht Treaty, it is logical that he calls for Parliament to have a full role in shaping the negotiations over our place in Europe. What may be harder for No 10 to dismiss is Sir John's obvious political concerns about how the public are being treated in the months after the referendum decision.Read more from LauraSir John said Brexit talks require ""statesmanship of a high order"" and warned of a ""real risk"" of the exit deal falling ""well below the hopes and expectations"" that have been raised, saying he doubted the ""rosy confidence being offered to the British people"".""In my own experience, the most successful results are obtained when talks are conducted with goodwill: it is much easier to reach agreement with a friend than a quarrelsome neighbour.""Behind the diplomatic civilities, the atmosphere is already sour. A little more charm, and a lot less cheap rhetoric, would do much to protect the UK's interests.""He also said the ""cheerleaders"" for Brexit had shown a ""disregard that amounts to contempt"" towards those that backed the losing side.And he said the UK would become ""far more dependent"" on the US after it leaves the EU, describing President Donald Trump as ""less predictable, less reliable and less attuned to our free market and socially liberal instincts than any of his predecessors"".Sir John, who as prime minister between 1990 and 1997 oversaw the start of the Northern Ireland peace process, warned that ""uncertainties over border restrictions"" after Brexit were ""a serious threat to the UK, to the peace process and for Ireland, North and South"".The ex-PM, who faced battles with Eurosceptic MPs during his time in Downing Street, also said Mrs May would have to ""face down"" people calling for ""total disengagement"" from Europe.But the Leave Means Leave campaign hit back, recalling Sir John's famous ""don't bind my hands"" plea to Tory Eurosceptics ahead of EU talks and saying he was now ""seeking to do just this to the British prime minister ahead of negotiations with the EU"".Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg added: ""It was a craven and defeated speech of a bitter man who was heavily defeated by the electorate for his own failings in Europe in 1997, was defeated again last June and now wishes to take out his failures on Mrs May."""

""It was published in print last week and only went online last night. ""However, as John said yesterday, he wants us all to focus on party unity following last week's by-election results. ""And he is looking to reach out in the coming days to those across all sections of the party and none."" Mr Corbyn, from the left of the party, was the overwhelming winner of Labour's leadership election in 2015, despite having the support of only a small number of the party's MPs.A challenge to him last year led to another vote of all Labour Party members and affiliated supporters, which he again won overwhelmingly.But many of the party's MPs have continued to be unhappy with his leadership, and the party trails the Conservatives in opinion polls. On Sunday, Mr Corbyn said Labour's by-election loss showed ""the scale of how hard our task is to persuade people of our message"".In a speech, he urged his party to ""remain united"" and not to ""give up"".Labour lost the seat of Copeland, in Cumbria, to the Conservatives last week - the first by-election gain by a governing party in 35 years.However, Labour managed to hold off a challenge from UKIP in a by-election, in Stoke-on-Trent Central, on Thursday.Questioned about his future after the speech, Mr Corbyn said: ""I'm carrying on as leader because I'm determined that we will deliver social justice in this country.""Asked if he would still be in place in 2020, when the next general election is expected to take place, he replied: ""I've given you a very, very clear answer - yes.""

Pressed on whether the prime minister had a message for those who could be affected by the changes, the spokesman said ""nobody is losing out"". He said a recent tribunal on assessments for PIP payments had ""broadened"" the criteria.The government is proposing changes to PIPs, which replaced the Disability Living Allowance, after tribunal rulings that claimants with psychological problems who cannot travel without help must be treated like those who are blind.The government says the rulings - if unchallenged - would have added £3.7bn to the benefits bill by 2023. The benefit is intended to help people cope with the extra costs of living with ill health or disability and are made according to the points a person scores in an assessment of their needs.Disabilities minister Penny Mordaunt said she was reforming the PIP payments to ""restore the original aim of the benefit"" to make sure support was given to the most needy.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said he was ""furious"" about the proposed changes to PIPS, and said Labour would pressurise the government to reverse them in next month's Budget.The Liberal Democrats said the government was using court losses ""as an excuse to severely restrict disability benefits""."

Former Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown said: ""There was no one quite like Gerald Kaufman: a brilliant speaker, a compelling writer, an acerbic wit and a conscientious constituency MP. ""With his sharp insights, he not only penned many famous lines but gave the wisest of advice to Labour leaders who relied upon him throughout his 47 years in Westminster.""Tony Blair, Labour prime minister from 1997 to 2007, said: ""Gerald was an extraordinary man, passionate, principled, acerbic and absolutely dedicated to the cause of social justice and the Labour Party.""A family spokesman confirmed he had been suffering from a long-term illness.Prime Minister Theresa May said she had been ""very sad"" to learn of Sir Gerald's death.""His was a life of remarkable commitment to his constituents in Manchester and to the political life of the nation... as Father of the House (a title taken by the longest serving MP) his wisdom and experience will be very much missed by MPs on all sides of the House.""Sir Gerald became an MP in north-west England in 1970, first for the Manchester Ardwick constituency and then for Manchester Gorton, which he had served since 1983. He was a junior minister between 1974 and 1979, and held a number of senior shadow cabinet posts through the 1980s, before returning to the backbenches in the early 1990s. A family spokesman said: ""Sir Gerald dedicated his life to serving those who he believed would benefit most from a Labour government and Labour values in action.

We have to be radical to become relevant once again.""In his Sunday Express article, Mr Banks called for senior figures he said were part of a ""Tory cabal"" to be expelled, saying: ""These dullards aren't bringing in Tory votes, Stoke proved that, so what are they for?""In response,  Patrick O'Flynn, an MEP and Mr Nuttall's principal political adviser, told the BBC's Sunday Politics that his advice would be: ""Donate and don't seek to dictate.""He said Mr Oakden was an ""excellent"" chairman and said the Leave.EU campaign had hardly been a ""smooth-running brilliant machine"".""I'm always happy if people who want to give money and support to our party want to stay in the party but I think the best donors donate and don't seek to dictate,"" he said.""Of course if they are expert in certain fields people should listen to their views, but to have a donor telling the party leader who should be party chairman, that's a non-starter."""
2017-02-27,"NHS misplaced 500,000 patient documents",https://web.archive.org//web/20170228030223/http://www.bbc.com/news/health-39101489,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkNHS England is investigating whether any patients have been harmed by an administrative mix-up. Some 500,000 documents containing medical information, including cancer test results, were mistakenly put in storage rather than being sent to the GP or filed in the patients' records. An investigation is under way, focusing on the estimated 2,500 patients who may have been adversely affected and need further medical checks. So far, no harm has been reported. The error occurred when a mail redirection company hired by the NHS failed to pass on documents that had either been incorrectly addressed or needed re-routing because the patient had moved to a new GP surgery. The company, NHS Shared Business Services, has expressed regret for the failings, which occurred between 2011 and 2016 in the East Midlands, the South West and north-east London.An NHS England spokesperson said: ""A team including clinical experts has reviewed that old correspondence and it has now all been delivered wherever possible to the correct practice.""Speaking in the House of Commons, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt confirmed that 2,000 of the higher risk cases had now been reassessed by doctors - at a cost of £2.2m - with no harm detected. The remaining 500 are still being assessed. He said it was ""completely extraordinary"" that so much data had gone missing unnoticed for so long.Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth described the ""astonishing"" failure as an ""absolute scandal"".""The news is heartbreaking for the families involved and it will be scarcely believable for these hospitals and GPs who are doing their best to deliver services despite the neglect of the government. We urgently need to know how this was allowed to happen, how many patients were involved and how many have been harmed, and whether patients remain at risk.""Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt first disclosed the data error in July 2016, but, at that time, did not say how many primary care patients had been affected. Dr Richard Vautrey of the British Medical Association said the error would have meant some GPs were treating patients without all the relevant information that they needed. ""That might mean repeat prescriptions, which would be unnecessary, as they have been taken before. And it might mean delay in diagnosis. If that happened it's at best an inconvenience to the patient, and at worst there's a risk of patient harm.""Katherine Murphy of the Patients Association said the episode had the potential to be hugely damaging to patient care and trust. ""Patients trust the NHS to look after their confidential information and this confidence is now eroded.""Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said: ""Patient care and safety must always be the number one priority when awarding private companies contracts for any work in the health service. What we are seeing here is companies bidding for, and being awarded, contracts for work that is much more complex that they originally thought. ""We must learn lessons from this - as we must learn from any errors - and ensure that any initiatives to increase efficiency in the NHS are undertaken with caution, and in the long term best interests of general practice, the wider NHS, and our patients.""Have you been informed that your records may have been misplaced?

2017-02-27,Business rates 'a ticking time bomb',https://web.archive.org//web/20170228030223/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-39098801,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkBusiness rates are a ""ticking time bomb"" for small companies in England which should be offered emergency help, the shadow business secretary has said.Labour's Rebecca Long-Bailey said many firms faced ""cliff-edge"" rises when new valuations take effect in April and that the process had been mishandled.The government says it has established a £3.6bn transitional fund to help businesses facing big jumps in rates.A spokesman said the changes meant all businesses would get a ""fair deal"".However, Ms Long-Bailey said: ""The reality is that business rates are a ticking time bomb.""It cannot be right for smaller town centre retailers to be facing massive hikes while the Amazons and ASOSs of this world have their business rates cut.""Labour's plan would include a fund worth £150m a year for the next three years for small and medium-sized firms at risk of bankruptcy due to ""sharp and unmanageable"" increases.It would be distributed by councils under already established powers to provide discretionary relief, with the cost covered by central government.Although many businesses are expecting small falls in business rates in April, around a third are expecting very sharp rises, with a fifth - mainly in the South East - expecting a rise of more than 40% immediately - and that is AFTER a government plan to use £3.6 billion pounds saved by the winners to offset the pain of the losers. The Federation of Small Business is warning than half of those facing hikes will reduce, postpone or cancel investment, with nearly a fifth considering closing down or selling up.Revaluations happen every five years, but the 2015 reset was postponed ahead of the last general election - hence the severity of the moves. Many of the newest and biggest retailers like Amazon and Asos are expected to benefit from reductions in rates on their out-of-town sites.The government has signalled it may find extra money to help the hardest hit. Many small business owners will be watching next week's Budget to see if it delivers.  In the long-term, Labour said the system should be fundamentally reformed to ease the burden on high streets and town centres.Meanwhile, a survey of 675 members of the Federation of Small Business (FSB) found that almost a fifth of businesses facing higher rates may consider closing their doors. The research suggested more than a third (36%) of small firms expected their rates to increase, with 44% expecting bills to eventually rise by more than £1,000 a year, and just over a fifth expecting an increase of more than 40%.FSB national chairman Mike Cherry said profitability among small businesses was falling: ""The costs of doing business for small firms are now at their highest levels since early 2014. The last thing we need is a business rates burden so heavy that it threatens the future growth prospects of our entrepreneurs.""On Monday Ms Long-Bailey will join shadow chancellor John McDonnell and shadow communities secretary Teresa Pearce for a discussion with business organisations including the FSB, British Retail Consortium and the British Chambers of Commerce.Andrew Silvester, deputy policy director at the Institute of Directors, said: ""This is a 20th century system and in a 21st century economy, it looks painfully out of date.""Labour also called for business rates to be indexed to the lower CPI measure of inflation rather than RPI and to exclude investment in plant and machinery from future business rates valuations.Christopher Richards, of the Engineering Employers Federation, said: ""The inclusion of plant and machinery in business rates bills represents a tax on productive investment and undermines the international competitiveness of UK manufacturing.""A government spokesman said: ""The revaluation is designed to bring rates into line with changes in the rental property market and ensures business rate bills more closely reflect the property market and that all businesses are getting a fair deal."""
2017-02-27,Benefits should be for 'really disabled',https://web.archive.org//web/20170228030223/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-39097019,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkDisability benefits should go to ""really disabled people"" not those ""taking pills at home, who suffer from anxiety"", a key Theresa May aide says.No 10 policy unit head George Freeman said personal independence payments (PIP) reforms were needed to roll back the ""bizarre"" decisions of tribunals.Ministers say the changes will save £3.7bn but leave a ""strong safety net"".But disability charity Scope criticised Mr Freeman's ""crude"" distinction between physical and mental health.And Labour said the comments were ""an insult to disabled people"".Responding to criticism online to his interview on BBC 5 live's Pienaar's Politics, Mr Freeman later tweeted that he had suffered from anxiety and depression in childhood, adding: ""I don't need any lectures on the damage anxiety does.""The government is proposing changes to PIPs, which replaced the Disability Living Allowance (DLA), after two tribunal rulings at the end of 2016 which it said would have added £3.7bn to the benefits bill by 2023. The benefit is intended to help people cope with the extra costs of living with ill health or disability and are made according to the points a person scores in an assessment of their needs. In his BBC interview Mr Freeman said: ""These tweaks are actually about rolling back some bizarre decisions by tribunals that now mean benefits are being given to people who are taking pills at home, who suffer from anxiety,"" he said.""We want to make sure we get the money to the really disabled people who need it.""The Conservative MP for Mid Norfolk added that he and the prime minister ""totally"" understood anxiety. ""We've set out in the mental health strategy how seriously we take it,"" he added.After the interview, shadow chancellor John McDonnell tweeted: ""This is an insult to disabled people. (George Freeman) should apologise immediately or Theresa May should make him.""And Scope chief executive Mark Atkinson said: ""It is unhelpful to make crude distinctions between those with physical impairments and mental health issues because the kind of impairment someone has is not a good indicator of the costs they will face.""Many disabled people will now be anxiously waiting to hear as to whether or not these tighter rules will affect their current PIP award.""The government must offer clarity and reassurance that these new measures will not negatively affect the financial support that disabled people receive now or in the future, and that they stand by their commitment to making no further changes to disability benefits in this Parliament.""Disabilities minister Penny Mordaunt said she was reforming the PIP payments to ""restore the original aim of the benefit"" to make sure support was given to the most needy.Mr McDonnell said he was ""furious"" about the proposed changes to PIPS, and said Labour would pressurise the government to reverse them in next month's Budget.""Next week the Tories will make out that the economy and the public finances are doing better, however, they are planning to go ahead with a £3.7bn cut to the disabled,"" he said.The cuts would mean many people with severe disabilities ""are going to be trapped in their homes"", he added.The Liberal Democrats said the government was using court losses ""as an excuse to severely restrict disability benefits"".A DWP spokeswoman said the government was ""committed to ensuring our welfare system is a strong safety net for those who need it""."

2017-02-27,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20170228030223/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThis article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide to the UK's vote to leave the European Union. It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 52% to 48%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who resigned on the day after losing the referendum. Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she says she will respect the will of the people. She has said ""Brexit means Brexit"" but there is still a lot of debate about what that will mean in practice especially on the two key issues of how British firms do business in the European Union and what curbs are brought in on the rights of European Union nationals to live and work in the UK. She set out more details of her negotiating hopes in her key speech on Brexit.The UK economy appears to have weathered the initial shock of the Brexit vote, although the value of the pound remains near a 30-year low, but opinion is sharply divided over the long-term effects of leaving the EU. Some major firms such as Easyjet and John Lewis have pointed out that the slump in sterling has increased their costs. Britain also lost its top AAA credit rating, meaning the cost of government borrowing will be higher. But share prices have recovered from a dramatic slump in value, with both the FTSE 100 and the broader FTSE 250 index, which includes more British-based businesses, trading higher than before the referendum. The Bank of England cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - a record low and the first cut since 2009 - after the vote and there has not been the economic slump or recession that some had predicted. The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it has to invoke an agreement called Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May has said she intends to trigger this process by the end of March 2017, meaning the UK will be expected to have left by the summer of 2019, depending on the precise timetable agreed during the negotiations. The government will also enact a Great Repeal Bill which will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. It is expected to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove.After a court battle, the UK's Supreme Court ruled in January that Parliament must be consulted before Article 50 is invoked. This is why a two line Brexit bill is currently making its way through Parliament. MPs have approved it after Labour MPs were told to support it. It has got through its first House of Lords debate with debate and votes on possible changes expected in the next week.Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These men - dubbed the Three Brexiteers - will play a central role in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although it will be Mrs May, as prime minister, who will have the final say. David Cameron's government did not do any emergency planning for Brexit ahead of the referendum and Mrs May has rejected calls to say what her negotiating goals are.Once Article 50 has been triggered, the UK will have two years to negotiate its withdrawal. But no one really knows how the Brexit process will work - Article 50 was only created in late 2009 and it has never been used. Former Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, now Chancellor, wanted Britain to remain in the EU, and he has suggested it could take up to six years for the UK to complete exit negotiations. The terms of Britain's exit will have to be agreed by 27 national parliaments, a process which could take some years, he has argued. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. The UK will continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making.Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Following Theresa May's Brexit recent speech we now know that the UK is not intending to stay in the EU's single market. Although there has been speculation for months about the issue, it would have meant the UK staying under the auspices of the European Court of Justice and having to allow unlimited EU immigration, under freedom of movement rules.Both sides want trade to continue after Brexit with the UK seeking a positive outcome for those who wish to trade goods and services"" - such as those in the City of London and wanting a ""comprehensive free trade deal"" giving the UK ""the greatest possible access"" to the single market. Mrs May says she wants the UK to reach a new customs union deal with the EU. A customs union is where countries agree not to impose tariffs on each others' goods and have a common tariff on goods coming in from elsewhere. The UK is currently part of the EU customs union but that stops the UK being able to do its own trade deals with other countries. Reality Check: How could customs union work?These terms have increasingly been used as debate focused on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people in order to maintain access to the EU single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result.The government has declined to give a firm guarantee about the status of EU nationals currently living in the UK, saying this is not possible without a reciprocal pledge from other EU members about the millions of British nationals living on the continent. EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, will be be able to stay, the chief civil servant at the Home Office has said. The rights of other EU nationals would be subject to negotiations on Brexit and the ""will of Parliament"", he added.A lot depends on the kind of deal the UK agrees with the EU. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions on EU nationals, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.Again, it depends on whether the UK government decides to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages. Citizens' Advice has reminded people their rights have not changed yet and asked anyone to contact them if they think they have been discriminated against following the Leave vote.Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested EU migrants who come to the UK as Brexit nears may not be given the right to stay. He has said there might have to be a cut-off point if there was a ""surge"" in new arrivals.People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote. The day-to-day spending impact is likely to be more significant. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it to remain at least 10% below where it was on 23 June, in the long term. This means imported goods will consequently get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have already been seen and the issue was most notably illustrated by the dispute between Tesco and Marmite's makers about whether prices would be put up or not in the stores.The latest UK inflation figures, for January, showed the CPI inflation rate rising to 1.8%, its highest level for two and a half years, with signs of more cost pressures set to feed through in the months to come.Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration.She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations. As mentioned above, the key issue is whether other EU nations will grant the UK access to the single market, if that is what it wants, while at the same time being allowed to restrict the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK.Mrs May has said she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. It is currently running at 330,000 a year, of which 184,000 are EU citizens, and 188,000 are from outside the EU - the figures include a 39,000 outflow of UK citizens.It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Liberal Democrats - who have just a handful of MPs - have vowed to halt Brexit and keep Britain in the EU if they were to win the next general election.Some commentators, including former House of Commons clerk Lord Lisvane, have argued that a further referendum would be needed to ratify whatever deal the UK hammers out with the EU, but there are few signs political leaders view this as a viable option.Yes. Theresa May has appeared keen to avoid a vote on her negotiating stance, to avoid having to give away her priorities, but Theresa May has said there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. It is worth mentioning that any deal also has to be agreed by the European Parliament - with British MEPs getting a chance to vote on it there.  While there could be limitations on British nationals' ability to live and work in EU countries, it seems unlikely they would want to deter tourists. There are many countries outside the European Economic Area, which includes the 28 EU nations plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway, that British citizens can visit for up to 90 days without needing a visa and it is possible that such arrangements could be negotiated with European countries.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. In theory, the government could, if it wanted, decide to change the colour, which is currently standardised for EU countries, says the BBC's Europe correspondent, Chris Morris.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketNo nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it is ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faces being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. A second independence referendum for the country is now ""highly likely"", she has said, although not in 2017. She has said she wants Scotland to stay in the single market and said Mrs May's decision to rule out the UK staying in the single market ""undoubtedly"" brings the referendum closer.Before his resignation Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said the impact in Northern Ireland would be ""very profound"" and that the whole island of Ireland should now be able to vote on reunification. But, speaking while she was still Northern Ireland Secretary, Theresa Villiers ruled out the call from Sinn Féin for a border poll, saying the circumstances in which one would be called did not exist. The land border is likely to be a key part of the Brexit talks. Theresa May said a priority for her would be negotiating a deal with the EU which allowed a common travel area between the UK and the Republic of Ireland.During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest. But his successor Theresa May has said she will keep it in place, at least for the current Parliament, which is due to last until 2020.So far there has been a cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. There are yet to be signs that rising inflation have worried the Bank of England  enough to consider raising interest rates.  But if that happened it would make mortgages and loans more expensive to repay - but would be good news for savers.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.Eurotunnel boss Jacques Gounon said last November the reintroduction of duty-free would be ""an incredible boost for my business"" but he later said  that remark had been ""light-hearted"". Erik Juul-Mortensen, president of the Tax Free World Association (TFWA) said after the referendum vote ""it is not possible to predict how Brexit will affect the duty free and travel retail industry, and it is wiser not to make assumptions about exactly what the impact will be.""  They are at the moment but no-one knows the longer term prospects for definite. The EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - is not an EU initiative. It was negotiated between countries within a group known as the European Economic Area, often simply referred to as the single market (plus Switzerland, which confusingly is not a member of the EEA, but has agreed access to the single market). Therefore, the future of Britons' EHIC cover could depend on whether the UK decided to sever ties with the EEA.Probably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report. In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two-thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.However, the UK government is committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, the UK government is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR. However, the EU has its own European Court of Justice, whose decisions are binding on EU institutions and member states.Its rulings have sometimes caused controversy in Britain and supporters of a Brexit have called for immediate legislation to curb its powers. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also cited sovereignty and democracy, and they wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Four of the biggest US banks have committed to helping maintain the City's position. But HSBC will move up to 1,000 jobs to Paris, the BBC understands. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Pest control firm Rentokil Initial says it could make £15m extra this year thanks to a weaker currency.Others are less optimistic. Hilary Jones, a director at UK cosmetics firm Lush said the company was ""terrified"" about the economic impact. She added that while the firm's Dorset factory would continue to produce goods for the UK market, products for the European market may be made at its new plant in Germany.Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After the Leave vote, the government will probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""As with most elements of the UK economy, not enough solid data has been published yet to accurately conclude the Brexit effect on house prices. Industry figures have pointed to ""uncertainty"" among buyers and sellers that could potentially change the housing market.So far, the most significant research has come from the respected Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which has published the conclusions of a survey of its members. This primarily records sentiment among surveyors.It found that house prices are expected to fall across the UK in the three months after the referendum vote. However, the dip in prices is only expected to persist over the 12 months from June in London and East Anglia, surveyors predict.House prices were already slowing in central London, owing to the fall-out from changes to stamp duty rules in April.Separate figures from property portal Rightmove suggested the average asking price of houses coming on to the market in England and Wales fell by 0.9%, or £2,647, in July compared with June. It said that agents had reported very few sales had fallen through as a result of the vote.Many potential first-time buyers would welcome a fall in house prices, with ownership among the young falling owing to affordability concerns. Investors in property, or those who have paid off a mortgage and hope to leave homes as inheritance would be unhappy with a long-term reduction in value.  Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law following the decision to leave the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" will not necessarily disappear overnight - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU means the UK will not be part of TTIP. It will have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Former Labour health secretary Lord Owen has said that because of TTIP (see answer above) the only way to protect the NHS from further privatisation was to get out of the EU."

2017-02-27,Who's Who: Theresa May's cabinet,https://web.archive.org//web/20170228030223/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36785814,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkTheresa May is forming her new government after becoming Conservative prime minister. She is continuing to announce her full cabinet - but here's what we know so far. The list will be updated as new appointments are made. Campaigned to Remain in the European Union The former home secretary, 59, becomes the UK's second female prime minister in the wake of David Cameron's resignation after the EU referendum. She had previously served in the Home Office for more than six years. Theresa May: Full profileHow does May's cabinet compare to Cameron's?Campaigned to Leave the EUBoris Johnson succeeds Philip Hammond at the Foreign Office. The former London mayor headed the campaign for the UK to leave the European Union. He did not previously have a ministerial appointment in Mr Cameron's government but accepted an invitation to attend political cabinet. He was not running any department. Mr Johnson, 52, may be one of the best known politicians in the country but the move to foreign secretary is a big step up from his previous role.Read how the world has reacted.Leave campaignerDavid Davis has been appointed to the new cabinet position of secretary of state for exiting the European Union - or ""Brexit secretary"". A veteran Eurosceptic, he has previously held the positions of Conservative party chairman and shadow deputy prime minister. Between 2003 and 2008, he was the shadow home secretary under both Michael Howard and David Cameron. Mr Davis, 67, lost to David Cameron in the 2005 Tory leadership contest. Details about the new Brexit department are still emerging, but it is likely to take the lead in negotiating Britain's departure from the EU and unpicking the thousands of pages of EU rules written into UK law.Theresa May is reported to have ordered civil servants to find a building for the new department.Leave campaignerLiam Fox, 54, has taken on another newly created position as secretary of state for international trade. He was made secretary of state for defence in 2010 but resigned in 2011 over allegations he had given a close friend, lobbyist Adam Werritty, access to the Ministry of Defence and allowed him to join official trips overseas.Like Mr Davis he is a Eurosceptic who voted to leave the EU and he also stood unsuccessfully for the Conservative Party leadership in 2005.He stood again in the latest race to be leader but was eliminated in the first ballot after winning the support of just 16 MPs.Remain campaignerThe appointment to chief whip is a big step up for Gavin Williamson, according to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg.David Cameron's former parliamentary private secretary, he also served as parliamentary private secretary to transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin.The 40-year-old from North Yorkshire was elected MP for South Staffordshire in 2010. As chief whip, he will attend Cabinet meetings.Remain campaignerKaren Bradley takes over from the deposed John Whittingdale as Culture, Media and Sport Secretary. She had been working with Theresa May as a Home Office minister since 2014.She was first elected MP for Staffordshire Moorlands in May 2010.Her appointment comes two months after Mr Whittingdale and the BBC agreed a major overhaul of the corporation.Read more about her appointment here.Leave campaignerAndrea Leadsom, the Conservative leadership candidate who dramatically pulled out of the race, is the new Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Secretary.The prominent Brexit backer is promoted from energy minister to a cabinet role which will see her take responsibility for a farming industry as it faces the end of European Union subsidies. She will also have to fashion a post-Brexit fisheries policy. Green campaigners will be watching carefully to see what happens to environment regulations in areas including wildlife habitats, air pollution and water quality, currently governed by rules from Europe. Mrs Leadsom's public reason for withdrawing from the leadership race was to allow a rapid transition at the top, and give the economy certainty in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. But our political editor Laura Kuenssberg says her friends were saying she was alarmed by the level of scrutiny given to her comments on motherhood reported in the Times.Read more on Mrs Leadsom's motivations for stepping aside here.Baroness Evans of Bowes Park becomes leader of the House of Lords at 40, in her first ministerial role since being ennobled by David Cameron in 2014.She attended London's Henrietta Barnett School and Cambridge University before becoming deputy director of the Conservative research department, deputy director of the Policy Exchange think-tank and chief operating officer of the New Schools Network - the organisation which ran Michael Gove's free schools programme.Remain campaignerDamian Green is appointed the new Work and Pensions Secretary, taking over from Stephen Crabb, who earlier resigned.Mr Green served as an Immigration Minister and Justice Secretary in the coalition government but has been on the backbenches since 2014.Leave campaignerPriti Patel is the new International Development Secretary, a promotion from her role as employment minister which she's held for just a year.Ms Patel became MP for Witham in 2010 and joined the front bench as a Treasury minister in 2014.She is no stranger to controversy, having previously advocated bringing back the death penalty and was accused of ""divide and rule politics"" during the referendum campaign for claiming that ""biased"" immigration policy prevents curry chefs from outside the EU from working in the UK.On her appointment, she immediately faced calls to guarantee the UK's legal commitment to spending 0.7% of GDP on overseas aid.Remain campaignerGreg Clark is secretary of state of a newly-created ministry of business, energy and industrial strategy.His appointment spells the end for a department which put climate change at the top of the agenda.Just eight years after it was created by then-prime minister Gordon Brown, the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) is being merged into Mr Clark's new department and losing the ""climate change"" part of its name.Environmentalists immediately expressed concern that the reshaping of departments showed the government was downgrading climate change as a priority.But Richard Black, director of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU), said Mr Clark's move was ""an excellent appointment"", saying he ""understands climate change, and has written influential papers on the benefits of Britain developing a low-carbon economy"".Remain campaignerJames Brokenshire, who has been working with Theresa May at the Home Office - where he was immigration minister - has been made Northern Ireland Secretary.He takes over from Theresa Villiers, who resigned from the cabinet having been offered another role but saying it was not one ""which I felt I could take on"". Before entering parliament Mr Brokenshire was a partner at a large international law firm.From 2011 to 2015, he served as security minister at the Home Office with responsibility for domestic national security and counter terrorism. This included supporting the home secretary with oversight of the work of MI5 and the national police counter-terrorism network.His responsibilities also included the government's counter-terrorism strategy and he was part of the prime minister's ""extremism taskforce"". He also led negotiations with the Jordanian government to secure the deportation of the radical cleric Abu Qatada.Read more on his appointment here.Remain campaignerDavid Lidington, former Europe Minister, is promoted to Leader of the House. He had been Europe Minister since 2010 but moves across to a post involving the smooth running of the Commons. The Cambridge history graduate and father-of-four has been MP for Aylesbury since 1992. He previously worked for BP and mining firm Rio Tinto.Campaigned to Remain in the EUPhilip Hammond has been named chancellor of the exchequer. He was foreign secretary under David Cameron from 2014 to 2016, having previously served as defence secretary and transport secretary. He replaces George Osborne.Mr Hammond, 60, is seen at Westminster as the ultimate safe pair of hands. Sometimes mocked as ""box office Phil"" for what some see as his dull delivery, he forged a reputation in the shadow Treasury team as the Tories' public spending ""axeman"".He was seen as a Eurosceptic who spoke of withdrawal if the EU were not reformed, but was a Remain campaigner in the referendum. He now has the job of steering Britain's economy through the choppy post-Brexit waters.Read what Mr Hammond has to say on his first day in the job.Remain campaignerAmber Rudd has been made home secretary, filling the vacancy left by Mrs May. Ms Rudd was formerly energy and climate change secretary, a position she held for just one year.During the campaign for Remain in the EU referendum, she warned in a TV debate that she would not trust the new Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson to drive her home at the end of a night out.The former investment banker, venture capitalist, and financial journalist, aged 52, decided to enter politics in her 40s in order to get ""a grip on her life"". She quickly joined the fast track to the top after being elected to Parliament as MP for Hastings and Rye. She was seen as a protege of then Chancellor George Osborne, serving as his parliamentary private secretary before being promoted to junior minister at the Energy and Climate Change department in 2014. Remain campaignerLiz Truss moves from her role as secretary for environment, food and rural affairs to replace Michael Gove as justice secretary.A qualified management accountant, she became MP for South West Norfolk in 2010 and was appointed education minister in 2012.She was brought up in Yorkshire and attended Roundhay, a comprehensive school in Leeds, and went on to read philosophy, politics and economics at Merton College, Oxford.Socially liberal, the 40-year-old was a founder member of the free enterprise group of Conservative MPs arguing for more deregulation of the economy.Remain campaignerJustine Greening has said she is ""absolutely delighted"" to be made the new education secretary, taking over from Nicky Morgan. She was also appointed minister for women and equalities. Her new department will also take on higher and further education, skills and apprenticeships.Ms Greening leaves her international development secretary post, which she was promoted to in October 2011.MP for Putney since 2005, she became economic secretary to the Treasury after the 2010 election, succeeding Philip Hammond as transport secretary after he was promoted to defence secretary.At London's Pride day on 25 June, two days after the Brexit vote, the 47-year-old announced in a tweet she was in a same-sex relationship, saying ""I campaigned for Stronger In but sometimes you're better off out!"".Read more about what's awaiting Ms Greening at the education department.Leave campaignerChris Grayling, Theresa May's leadership campaign chief, has been appointed transport secretary. He was formerly Leader of the House.The most pressing jobs in his in-tray include dealing with the travel chaos caused by Southern Rail's disrupted services, the expansion of airport capacity in south-east England and high speed rail link, HS2.He's got some experience in this department, having served as shadow transport secretary from December 2005 to 2007.The Brexiteer had a surprisingly low-key, restrained referendum, largely refraining from ""blue-on-blue"" attacks. He was also one of the few Vote Leave spokesmen to share a platform with former UKIP leader Nigel Farage. Remain campaignerPatrick McLoughlin leaves his role as transport secretary to become Conservative Party chairman and chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.An MP since 1986, the former miner also served as chief whip, after being appointed to the role in David Cameron's first cabinet.As transport secretary, he was in charge of several large-scale projects including Crossrail and HS2. The 58-year-old said he was ""very pleased indeed"" with his new role.Remain campaignerSajid Javid is moved sideways from business secretary to secretary of the department for communities and local government.Mr Javid, considered a protege of former chancellor George Osborne's, held the culture secretary position before being appointed to the business role last year and is a former managing director of Deutsche Bank. The 46-year-old University of Exeter graduate stood on a ""joint ticket"" with Stephen Crabb for the leadership election, hoping to be chancellor if Mr Crabb had become PM.Remain campaignerMichael Fallon has kept his job at the Ministry of Defence - a position the 64-year-old has held since 2014.He was Conservative MP for Darlington from 1983 to 1992 - initially during Margaret Thatcher's time in Downing Street - and after leaving Parliament, he was later re-elected as MP for Sevenoaks in 1997.A former Conservative Party deputy chairman, he has previously served as energy and business minister, and before that secretary of state for business and enterprise.Seen as a safe pair of hands in Westminster, he described himself as a ""pretty reluctant Remainer"" after the EU referendum.Remain campaignerDespite earlier speculation, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt remains in his post.The 49-year-old was appointed culture secretary in David Cameron's first coalition government, a role he held for two years - including while London played host to the 2012 Olympic Games.He took over the health portfolio following a cabinet reshuffle in 2012, and described the appointment as the ""biggest privilege of my life"". Most recently, Mr Hunt has been locked in a battle with the British Medical Association over a new contract for junior doctors, which has led to a series of strikes.Remain campaignerDavid Mundell will continue as Secretary of State for Scotland.Mr Mundell, the only Scottish Conservative MP, said his focus was now on ""ensuring Scotland gets the best possible deal out of the EU negotiations"".Former prime minister David Cameron first appointed Mr Mundell to the post when he held his Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale seat for the third consecutive election in 2015.Remain campaignerMay's cabinet: Who's in and who's out? Alun Cairns, MP for the Vale of Glamorgan, remains in his cabinet role as secretary of state for Wales.He was appointed to the post just four months ago so there was little surprise that he will retain his position. The 45-year-old, who was born in Swansea and is a graduate of the University of Wales, Newport, was elected as MP for the Vale of Glamorgan in 2010. He worked in banking for a decade before his election to the Welsh Assembly. Remain campaignerGeorge Osborne has been fired as chancellor.He had been in the Treasury since 2010 - throughout David Cameron's tenure in Downing Street. He had also been first secretary of state since May 2015. A key ally of Mr Cameron, Mr Osborne tweeted it had been a ""privilege"" to be chancellor, adding: ""Others will judge - I hope I've left the economy in a better state than I found it.""Leave campaignerMichael Gove has been fired as justice secretary. The former Times journalist also served under David Cameron as education secretary in the coalition government, and as chief whip.He successfully campaigned for Brexit alongside Boris Johnson - but later withdrew his support for his colleague to be Conservative leader and prime minister, instead standing himself. He was eliminated in the final round of voting by MPs in third place.His surprise move to stand for the leadership and therefore to become prime minister effectively dashed Mr Johnson's hopes of running.Remain campaignerNicky Morgan is to leave her post as education secretary. The 43-year-old, who qualified as a lawyer, became an MP in 2010 and rose to the cabinet position of minister for women and equalities in 2013.London-born Ms Morgan replaced Michael Gove as education secretary in 2014. She reportedly considered standing in the Conservative leadership contest, but ultimately threw her support behind leave campaigner Mr Gove, despite campaigning for a Remain vote herself.In a tweet, she said she was ""disappointed"" not to be continuing her work in the education department, before congratulating her successor Justine Greening, saying she was ""committed to excellence in education"".Remain campaignerWork and Pensions Secretary Stephen Crabb has resigned from government ""in the best interests of my family"". He was one of the four contenders who lost out to Theresa May for the Conservative leadership.BBC political correspondent Vicki Young says it's not yet known whether Mr Crabb was offered a post he did not want or had just decided to resign from the government, possibly following some newspaper stories about his private life at the weekend. Read more about Mr Crabb here.Leave campaignerJohn Whittingdale has left his post as culture secretary. The Leave campaigner was vice-chairman of the influential group of Tory MPs called the 1922 Committee until he took over the portfolio for culture, media and sport after the general election in 2015 from Sajid Javid.In a tweet, he said it had been ""a privilege"" to serve as culture secretary, and wished his successor ""every success"".  Leave campaignerTheresa Villiers steps down as Northern Ireland secretary, saying she declined an offer of another role from the new prime minister.Former barrister Ms Villiers, MP for Chipping Barnet, had held the Northern Ireland portfolio since 2012. Prior to that, she was a Member of the European Parliament for six years.In December 2005, Mr Cameron promoted her to shadow chief secretary to the Treasury.

True, Sir John Major is not the only former Tory leader familiar with being pressured, perhaps held hostage by the Eurosceptics in his party. Or indeed, the only Conservative leader ever to have been challenged by his party's preponderance to ""bang on"" (to use David Cameron's phrase) about Europe. But arguably his experiences as the leader during bruising encounters with the ""bastards"" mean his words of warning might hold some value for the current prime minister. For Theresa May, also an unflashy leader who was propelled to No 10 by a surprising political moment, Europe will be defining in a way no others could even have anticipated.In Sir John's carefully calibrated speech tonight, there are plenty of messages for her, some of which may be welcome, some not. First off, having campaigned to stay in the European Union, with sober warnings particularly about the consequences for the Northern Irish peace process, it's no surprise that Sir John says that in his view, Brexit will be a ""historic mistake"".It is notable, although again not surprising, that he cautions that the UK will be a diminished diplomatic force in the world after we walk away from the EU, with a warning too that we will be less useful to our most important ally the US as a consequence.Also, even as the PM who lived through the Commons trauma of trying to deliver the Maastricht Treaty, it is logical that he calls for Parliament to have a full role in shaping the negotiations over our place in Europe. What may be harder for No 10 to dismiss is Sir John's obvious political concerns about how the public are being treated in the months after the referendum decision.Despite insisting he has no desire to be in politics now, he makes very pointed criticism of the atmosphere around the debate, warning that voters are essentially being misled saying: ""People have been led to expect a future that seems to be unreal and over-optimistic.""Obstacles are brushed aside as of no consequence, whilst opportunities are inflated beyond any reasonable expectation of delivery."" In his first public comments since the vote, the former prime minister is offering what he describes as a ""reality check"".And he sounds alarm bells too about the tone of the debate, saying Brexit's ""cheerleaders"" have shown ""contempt"" to Remainers, shouting down dissent ""against our traditions of tolerance"".While he is not seeking to be unhelpful to the government, Sir John plainly has doubts about Number 10's handling of the process so far - the ""rosy confidence"" being offered to the British people.And in the depths of his speech there is another warning for Theresa May about the Tory MPs she has worked so hard to keep on side - ""today they may be allies of the prime minister, the risk is that tomorrow they may not"".Might Theresa May face her own ""bastards"" one day? In recent weeks, with Theresa May determined to keep the Tory party together, and Labour struggling to stay united, the momentum has most certainly been with those celebrating our journey toward the exit door.Ministers, even those who were ardent Remainers, privately sound increasingly optimistic about the prospects of doing a deal. But Sir John Major is not alone in having fundamental concerns. And his voice is harder for the government to dismiss, as they did Tony Blair a couple of weeks ago. One senior figure even told me some of the talks behind closed doors have been a shambles, and raised concern that the government, all of us, are a long way from understanding the full implications of the decision. Yet with almost the only political pressure on her coming from the right, Theresa May has decided to emphasise the opportunity, not the risks. The government is well aware that things could go wrong, but one minister told me ""we all have to discover the reality together, when the rubber hits the road"". "
2017-02-27,Northern Ireland election,https://web.archive.org//web/20170228030223/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-politics-39065379,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkOn Thursday, 2 March, Northern Ireland's voters go to the polls to elect a new government. Here's a guide to the political picture ahead of the imminent vote. That's right, Northern Ireland already did the election dance last May but we're going back to the ballot box just 10 months later.Stormont's power-sharing government collapsed in January.The collapse came about after Northern Ireland's deputy first minister, Sinn Féin's Martin McGuinness, resigned.In Northern Ireland, the government must be run by Irish nationalists and unionists together.The system was set up by the Good Friday Agreement following years of conflict. A first and deputy first minister, taken from the largest and second largest parties elected, are appointed to lead an executive of ministers.Although they have different titles, they essentially have equal authority and, in theory, work together in partnership.At the beginning of the year, the first minister was Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Arlene Foster who worked with Mr McGuinness as deputy first minister. But after he resigned, and Sinn Féin refused to nominate a replacement, Secretary of State James Brokenshire had no choice but to call for a new election.He stepped down after a row between Sinn Féin and the DUP over a green energy scheme scandal - the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI).You can read all about the scheme here. But, here's the short(-ish) version:Mrs Foster was in charge of the scheme when it was set up in 2012. It was designed to encourage businesses to switch from fossil fuels to environmentally friendly alternatives.But, subsidies were over-generous and initially there was no cap on payments - leading to what has been dubbed the ""cash-for-ash"" scandal. The scheme is projected to run £490m over budget, although a plan to eliminate the overspend was passed by the assembly just before it broke up in January. Sinn Féin asked that Mrs Foster temporarily stand aside while an investigation was carried out, but she refused.It's more complicated than that. While the scheme was the catalyst for Mr McGuinness resignation, he and Sinn Féin have said it was just one of many issues it had with the DUP, including Brexit (which the DUP backed, while Sinn Féin did not), same-sex marriage (to which the DUP is opposed, while Sinn Féin is in favour) and a potential Irish language act.These issues could become very important if the two parties retain their dominant positions as deal makers in March.Well, for one, Martin McGuinness is not back for re-election. A week after resigning, he announced he was quitting frontline politics because of ill health. Michelle O'Neill was appointed Sinn Féin's Northern leader in his stead and is leading the party into an election for the first time. Other than that, there's a major change in numbers, as less people are going to get elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly - only 90 MLAs (Members of the Legislative Assembly) as opposed to 108 last year.To reduce costs, Stormont decided in February 2016 it would cut the numbers. However, the law is being implemented a bit sooner than expected - it was thought the reduction would be introduced for the next scheduled election in 2021. Now, 18 MLAs will lose out less than a year after getting in the Stormont door. It remains to be seen, but the big two - DUP and Sinn Féin - are still the parties to beat. They led the power-sharing government after 2016's election and have been the big players at Stormont since 2007. The Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) and Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), the two other major unionist and nationalist parties, are aiming to usurp them. Last year, these two formed the first official opposition at the Northern Ireland Assembly.Meanwhile the Alliance Party, Northern Ireland's fifth largest with eight MLAs elected last year, is a centrist, non-sectarian group that straddles the line between unionist and nationalist. They are hoping to take advantage of any voter dissatisfaction at the DUP/Sinn Féin leadership and are also under new leadership, with former MP Naomi Long at the helm. They've been bubbling up in recent years. Jim Allister, leader of hard-line unionist party the TUV (Traditional Unionist Voice) has been a fixture at Stormont since 2011, which will be hoping to add to its solitary MLA.Likewise, the Green Party doubled its representation to two MLAs in 2016 and is optimistic of a strong showing. Also look out for anti-austerity outfit People Before Profit, who took their first two seats ever last year and are running even more candidates this time around. A form of proportional representation called Single Transferable Vote (STV) is used to elect candidates to the Northern Ireland Assembly. Voters rank candidates in order of preference.Candidates are then elected according to the share of the vote they receive. You can read an in-depth guide to the system here, or check out this video explainer. The two biggest unionist and nationalist parties will get together and try to form a new government.If it's the UUP and SDLP, then we should see a Stormont government under new leadership in reasonably short order.But, it's more likely that once again the DUP and Sinn Féin will be tasked with reaching agreement. And since they spectacularly fell out just a few weeks ago, that could be a challenge...That remains to be seen. But, Sinn Féin has repeatedly said there will be ""no return to the status quo"", so it appears they will not re-enter government with the DUP without agreement over thorny issues like the failed RHI scheme and the Irish language.It's apparent that some in-depth negotiations will be needed if both parties are elected. But the clock will be ticking - those tasked with forming a government have three weeks to agree and appoint an executive of ministers.If they can't find agreement on those issues then, technically, there could be another election.It's pretty unlikely. Instead, some other way of governing Northern Ireland will have to be found with direct rule from Westminster a real possibility. Nationalists have said that direct rule would be unacceptable, and called for the British and Irish governments to come together to form some kind of ""joint authority"" if the Northern Ireland Assembly cannot be re-established.However, unionists are against this idea while the Secretary of State James Brokenshire has said he is not considering any alternatives to a Northern Ireland Assembly. Whatever happens in Thursday's election, it's likely to be just the start of Northern Ireland's journey back to devolved government. "

This will not affect the claims of current claimants. Last year, the government lost two cases in what is known as the Upper Tribunal - part of the courts system - about who should receive the Personal Independence Payment (PIP) and how much they should receive.The PIP is for people who face additional costs because of a disability or long-term illness. It has two elements: the daily living component and the mobility component.PIP assessments are based on a system of points, which are awarded to claimants according to the seriousness of their conditions.The number of points an applicant receives determines whether they are eligible for either element of PIP and, if so, whether at the standard or higher rate.The tribunal's rulings covered the two elements. The first found that some claimants who require assistance to take medication or monitor a health condition should receive more points than the assessments currently give. The second found that claimants who suffer overwhelming psychological distress when taking journeys should receive more points.The effect of the rulings would be to increase the number of eligible applicants and increase the number of people who qualify for the higher rates.The Department for Work and Pensions estimates that the total cumulative cost of complying with the tribunal's decisions would be £3.7bn over the next four years.         Disabilities minister Penny Mordaunt released a written statement on Thursday 23 February explaining that the government would seek to overturn the tribunal's decisions.That can be done using a statutory instrument that amends the Welfare Reform Act 2012. Labour opposes the reform and will seek to block the statutory instrument in the House of Lords and the House of Commons.If the government succeeds in getting the reform through, it will mean fewer people will receive PIPs in the future and fewer people will qualify for the higher rates. But it will not cut the awards of current claimants. Read more from Reality Check"
2017-02-27,Voter changes,https://web.archive.org//web/20170228030223/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-39103972,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA few days ago, British politics saw a stunning by-election result in the Cumbrian seat of Copeland. After electing Labour MPs for 80 years, voters changed their minds and elected a Conservative. What makes voters do this, and why is swing voting on the rise?Back in the 1960s, about 13% of voters would change which party they voted for, says Dr Jonathan Mellon from Nuffield College, Oxford. In 2015, that was closer to 40%. ""A really large proportion of voters are swingers - and this has been steadily increasing in each subsequent election,"" says Dr Mellon.There have always been some voters who changed their minds. The classic swing voter has no particular allegiance to any one party, and may choose a different party from one election to the next. Their decision can decide the outcome of an election, but this usually happens indirectly. ""Either you'll get swings from the major parties to minor parties - such as traditionally the Liberal Democrats but now also UKIP, the Greens, the SNP - or you'll see voters swing back to one of the major parties,"" Dr Mellon says.Joe Twyman, head of political and social research at the polling company YouGov, analysed swing voting at the most recent general election. ""One way of shifting that surprised a lot of people was the move from the Liberal Democrats to UKIP, and when people saw the data on that they would say, 'Well hang on, that doesn't make any sense, the ideology and the policies of Liberal Democrats are very different from those of UKIP. Why should people do that?' ""But it's about protest.""In the past few years, all the major parties have provided reasons for voters to turn against them. The Conservatives damaged their reputation with Black Wednesday, a day-long economic crisis in 1992. The Labour Party lost a million votes after the Iraq War, with many loyal members defecting to the Liberal Democrats or the Green Party.Liberal Democrat activist Tom Southern witnessed voters turn against his party, angry with it for joining a Conservative-led coalition government and raising university tuition fees. ""It was clear immediately that around half the support had been wiped out within months if not weeks,"" he says.And yet the coalition government was also beneficial to the smaller parties, including the Liberal Democrats. The public saw that a minor party had teamed up with a major party and was now in government. And this impression was reinforced during the 2015 general election campaign, when the leaders of seven different parties appeared on TV debates. The media proclaimed that any one of the smaller parties might hold the balance of power. This campaign proved to be a catalyst for voters. One in every 12 people in the UK voted for UKIP. One in two people in Scotland voted for the SNP.It is much rarer for voters to switch between Labour and the Conservatives. But the Copeland by-election is a reminder that this does happen. James Tilley, professor of politics at the University of Oxford, has studied one reason why voters might make this move.""In Britain it is definitely the case that older people are much more likely to vote for the Conservatives than younger people,"" he says. As voters get older, they are about 20% more likely to vote for the Conservative Party. But the reason for this is hard to identify. ""It could be that people born a long time ago are more likely to vote for the Conservatives,"" says Prof Tilley, ""or it could be that as we get older we become more likely to vote for the Conservatives."" He leans towards the second explanation.""People generally become a bit more resistant to change as they get older, and I think also that they tend to become less idealistic,"" says Prof Tilley.""So if parties on the right represent a platform which is more favourable to the status quo, and more about pragmatism than it is about idealism, that might be more attractive to older people than younger people.""Swing voting is a nightmare for the parties.In the past, MPs relied on their core vote to back them no matter what. Now, they have to spend far more of their time campaigning to keep their seats and far less time legislating. Politicians argue that democracy is less efficient when voters keep changing their minds.But Rosie Campbell, professor of Politics at Birkbeck, University of London, thinks that politics works best when voters are willing to change their minds. ""In the past, voters stuck with parties that had let them down, or had morphed into something they didn't like,"" she says.""Even if the future is more chaotic, the rise of the swinging mindset might just be the change our political system so desperately needs.""Analysis: How Voters Decide, presented by Prof Rosie Campbell, is on BBC Radio 4 at 20:30 on Monday 27 February and available later via BBC iPlayer."
2017-02-27,German Brits,https://web.archive.org//web/20170228030223/http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-39082468,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe Brexit debate in the UK is focusing on the rights of EU migrants in the country, among them about 300,000 Germans. Many people are worried about what will happen to them after Brexit. But how are the 100,000 Brits in Germany feeling? The BBC's Damien McGuinness says many are hurrying to apply for citizenship. ""So, when are you becoming German?"" It's one of those questions that always seems to crop up when I'm chatting to British friends here in Berlin these days. Most are either applying for German citizenship or counting the days until they've spent enough time here to be eligible. That's because no-one knows what will happen to them once Britain leaves the EU. These are not the bronzed ""expats"" of the tabloid imagination - living it up in the sun, glass of gin in one hand, golf club in the other. They are young freelancers worried that if they need visas their work will dry up. Or pensioners living in rented flats, surviving on fixed incomes tied to a shrinking pound. Esme was the most organised of any of us. She made her first appointment with the German authorities the week before the referendum. She took the citizenship test, submitted all the documents, and a few weeks ago became German in a ceremony in her local town hall, in the Berlin district of Neukoelln. What surprised her was how emotional she felt about it. About 50 people, of 22 different nationalities were being granted German citizenship: Syrians, Americans, Iraqis, Turks, Italians, French - even a few other Brits.The local mayor gave a speech welcoming everyone, and reflected on the meaning of Heimat, or homeland. And as she quoted from the German constitution, and talked about how all people were equal, regardless of gender, origin or ethnicity, Esme felt tears in her eyes. A cellist and a pianist played the 22 different national anthems of those present - by then, Esme was almost sobbing. And finally a singer came in to give a moving rendition of the European anthem, Beethoven's Ode to Joy - by which time Esme was in pieces. Not bad for an out-and-out liberal, who's usually pretty sceptical about flag-waving. ""It was the thought of the journeys that everyone had taken to get here,"" Esme explained to me afterwards. ""The wars that people had escaped from. And the efforts they had made to start a new life in Germany."" Some people had learned, off by heart, the declaration of allegiance to the German constitution, especially for the ceremony. Esme said it put her own worries into perspective.For Esme, and I suspect for a lot of the Brits who are now becoming German, what started out as a practical decision about visas and passports, is unexpectedly raising deeper questions about identity. Can you really be both German and British? And what does it mean to be German anyway? Not so very long ago, saying to other Brits that you're becoming German would almost inevitably lead to some tired gag about Nazis or towels on sun loungers. And although some British headlines might still use those cliches - and you can expect a few more if Brexit talks get nasty - today, modern Germany is seen more often as a bastion of tolerant values: international, democratic and open to immigrants.Of course, there are people outside and inside Germany who criticise Angela Merkel's decision to allow so many foreigners in. But for those new British-Germans, themselves migrants, a country that  welcomes foreigners is attractive. In fact, being a German with a hyphen is a relatively new concept here. Traditionally German identity was an ethnic idea, related to bloodline rather than where you were born. So it used to feel as if Britain and America were rather better at accepting that people had layered identities - enabling you to be originally from one country, but a citizen of another. But over the past few decades Germany has been going through a difficult, and largely successful, process of redefining what it means to be German. Angela Merkel now refers to Germany as ""a country of immigration"" - an unimaginable statement for a centre-right chancellor until very recently. And today 20% of Germans are described as having a migrant background. Brexit-Britain and Trump's US, meanwhile, seem to be heading in the opposite direction. At least, that's what it looks like from here.  As for me, my own citizenship status is a bureaucratic muddle. It's no doubt my own fault for moving around too much, but growing up in a globalising world I had thought passports, borders and notions of citizenship were losing their importance. Today though, as I scrabble together previously unheard of documents to avoid suddenly becoming an illegal alien, I can see I was wrong.Join the conversation - find us on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter."

After a brief spell as assistant secretary of the Fabian Society, he was selected to fight Bromley in the 1955 general election. He was roundly defeated by the Conservative candidate, the future Prime Minister Harold Macmillan.Four years later he failed at Gillingham, another safe Conservative seat where the Labour vote actually fell. He had secured a job on the Daily Mirror, where he often wrote leaders. In 1964 he moved to the New Statesman for a short time before working for the Labour Party as a press officer, in which post he became a member of one of Prime Minister Harold Wilson's so-called ""kitchen cabinet"".It was while visiting his mother in Leeds in November 1962 that he saw the first episode of the BBC's satirical programme That Was the Week That Was. Back in his Daily Mirror office, he phoned the producer, Ned Sherrin, and told him he had an idea for a sketch.""He had no idea who I was,"" Kaufman later recalled, ""but he said, 'Write it and I'll send a taxi in the morning to pick it up.'""It led to Kaufman becoming a regular contributor to the show, best known for his Silent Men of Westminster, a satire on MPs who never spoke in the House. Labour lost the 1970 general election, but Kaufman finally got into Parliament as the member for Manchester Ardwick. When Labour returned to power in 1974 he held junior ministerial posts in the Department of the Environment and the Department of Industry. He became shadow environment secretary in 1980 and, three years later when his Ardwick seat disappeared in boundary changes, he moved to Manchester Gorton, becoming shadow home secretary after Margaret Thatcher won the 1983 election.Kaufman was scathing about Labour's move to the left. He accused Tony Benn of nearly destroying the party when he stood as deputy leader in 1981. He later said he would have quit Parliament had Benn been successful.He was equally critical of Michael Foot's leadership and famously described Labour's 1983 manifesto, which advocated, among other things, unilateral nuclear disarmament and renationalisation of recently privatised industries, as ""the longest suicide note in history"".After a term as shadow foreign secretary, he returned to the back benches in 1992 and became chairman of the Select Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.There he was able to indulge in a series of attacks on what he called cultural elitism. His savaging of Mary Allen, then chief executive of the Royal Opera House, over her failure to account for spiralling costs, saw her resign her position.The satirical TV puppet show, Spitting Image, lampooned Kaufman as the serial killer Hannibal Lecter, from The Silence of the Lambs. He became notable for harsh criticism of BBC management and called for the BBC to be privatised, claiming that the corporation could be funded by big business. He also castigated the BBC over its apology for the obscene calls made by Jonathan Ross and Russell Brand to the actor Andrew Sachs, saying that it was ""not enough"".Kaufman's most vocal attacks were reserved for Israel and its policies towards the Palestinians. A member of the Jewish Labour Movement, he called for economic sanctions against Israel and a ban on sales of arms.In 2002 he broke a longstanding pledge never to visit Israel when he went there to make a BBC documentary called The End of An Affair, which charted his early infatuation with the Jewish state as a young student and how he later became disillusioned. He launched a bitter attack on the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon. ""It is time to remind Sharon,"" he said, ""that the Star of David belongs to all Jews, not to his repulsive government.""He often compared Israel's treatment of the Palestinians with South African apartheid and, described Israel's use of white phosphorus flares in the 2009 offensive in Gaza as ""war crimes"".""I long ago gave up hope for the Israelis participating in a negotiated solution,"" he said in 2014.Kaufman himself came under fire when the Daily Telegraph published its investigation into MPs' expenses in 2009. It emerged he had claimed more than £115,000 for work on his London flat and spent £8,000 on a large-screen TV and another £1,500 on a luxury rug. Following the general election of May 2015, he became Father of the House, a title bestowed on the sitting MP who is not a minister who has the longest unbroken period of service in the House of Commons.A prolific author, he wrote a number of books on the art and practice of politics.Kaufman was not a clubbable man and not one to suffer fools either gladly or quietly, something that did not endear him to many of his parliamentary colleagues. That, along with Labour's almost two decades of opposition, may well explain why a politician with undoubted intellect, and one of the pioneers of the New Labour project, never served in the cabinet of a Labour government.Gerald Kaufman was knighted in 2004.

The veteran Gaullist already has form.When he was Commissioner for the Internal Market and Financial Services, Mr Barnier was dubbed ""the most dangerous man in Europe"" after taking on the banking sector and championing a cap on bankers' bonuses. But while he alarmed some in the City, and will probably do so again, he also won grudging respect as a tough but even-handed negotiator.He will need all those skills and more in his new role - chief Brexit negotiator at the European Commission. And having moved seamlessly between big jobs in Paris and Brussels - French foreign minister, Commissioner, MEP - he looks well prepared. ""Don't ask me to tell you what will be at the end of the road, we haven't begun to walk yet,"" he told a conference in Brussels last month. Mr Barnier will stick closely to the official EU position of ""no negotiation without notification"" - waiting for the UK to trigger Article 50 to start the formal process of withdrawal. But he's clearly eager to get going.""I am waiting to begin,"" he said. ""I will be ready tomorrow to negotiate, frankly speaking.""And he will bring with him an instinctive pro-European agenda, and a deep knowledge of the workings of the single market.His deputy as chief Brexit negotiator is a German trade expert, Sabine Weyand, adding to the impression that Mr Barnier will lead a team that means business.One of the biggest challenges he (and his boss Jean-Claude Juncker) faces, is to ensure that representatives of the big member states don't sideline him in the Brexit divorce negotiations.But Mr Barnier's long career in French politics means he could well have the ear of the Elysee Palace, especially if - as looks likely - a centre-right candidate wins the French presidency next year. The stakes are so high that there are bound to be some clashes.Mr Barnier has sparred with the UK's Minister for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, before, when the men both served as Europe ministers in the 1990s. It is another reminder that Michel Barnier is a politician first and foremost, rather than a bureaucrat. There have certainly been criticisms - a dash of vanity, a lack of attention to detail. His career has had plenty of downs as well as ups.But he will defend his European vision to the end, and the British government would do well not to underestimate him.At the height of the eurozone crisis, Mr Barnier always refused (politely) to do broadcast interviews in English.""One wrong word,"" he told me once with a smile, ""and we could move markets.""The next few years will be equally challenging."

Scotland voted 62% in favour of Remain.The conversation online was being driven overwhelmingly by pro-independence campaigners. But people who had supported ""Better Together"" during the Scottish referendum vote also spoke about the possibility of a break-away from the UK as a result of the vote over EU membership.  Perhaps the most significant was Scottish author JK Rowling who tweeted: ""Scotland will seek independence now. Cameron's legacy will be breaking up two unions. Neither needed to happen.""Many took to Twitter to express new or strengthened pro-independence feelings in the wake of the latest vote (Just as a reminder: a ""Yes"" vote in Scotland's 2014 referendum was for independence, while the winning ""No"" campaign backed staying in the UK).One old tweet from 2014's independence referendum gained new life on Friday. Put out by the cross-party Better Together campaign, it reminded Scottish voters that the EU membership of an independent Scotland would be no sure thing:Blog by Mike WendlingNext story: Nigel Farage's wild nightAs the EU referendum vote swung decisively to Leave, perhaps nobody's fortunes changed more than UKIP leader Nigel Farage.

2017-02-28,Osborne: Don't cut UK off from EU trade,https://web.archive.org//web/20170228234449/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-39116895,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkGeorge Osborne has warned that leaving the European Union without any trade deal would amount to ""the biggest act of protectionism in British history.""The ex-chancellor told business leaders that the UK could not rely on new trade deals beyond Europe after Brexit.But Boris Johnson said the UK could be ""ever-more European and ever-more internationalist"" at the same time.The foreign secretary said there was ""every reason"" to believe a ""win-win"" EU deal could be done within two years.Downing Street said Prime Minister Theresa May was ""confident and optimistic"" about striking a comprehensive free trade agreement.No 10 also said Brexit Secretary David Davis had told cabinet on Tuesday that the UK must prepare itself for the ""unlikely scenario"" this could not be achieved.In another development, a senior Nissan executive has told MPs the car maker may ""adjust"" its business in the UK dependent on the outcome of Brexit.Colin Lawther said Nissan, which in October committed to building two new models at its Sunderland plant, would ""constantly review"" its decision in light of any major changes and the firm believed remaining in the customs union was vital. The government is expected to notify the EU of its intention to leave next month, paving the way for a two-year negotiation over the terms of exit and the shape of the UK's future relationship with the EU.Theresa May has said no deal would be better than a bad one and indicated she would be prepared to see the UK revert to World Trade Organisation trading rules in the absence of any agreement. Mr Osborne, who campaigned to remain in the EU but was sacked by Mrs May after she took power in July, told business leaders that he recognised that the UK would be leaving the EU and he was not seeking to ""fight the last war"".But he said leaving the EU without a proper agreement would impose significant costs on the British economy, with up to half of all British exports facing tariffs and additional regulations for trading with EU. ""Let's make sure that we go on doing trade with our biggest export market,"" he said.""Otherwise withdrawing from the single market will be the biggest single act of protectionism in the history of the United Kingdom.""And no amount of trade deals with New Zealand are going to replace the trade that we do at the moment with our big European neighbours.""He also expressed doubts about whether a special customs arrangement could be agreed with the EU replicating the existing benefits of the customs union.Critics of Brexit, including former prime ministers Tony Blair and Sir John Major, have warned that there is little chance any new trade deal could match the advantages of the UK's current membership of the single market.But speaking at the same conference, Mr Johnson said he had had enough of hearing people ""droning on and moaning about the state of the world"".""Since June 2016, the sky has obstinately failed to fall in,"" he said.The UK's interests, he added, had not been best served by delegating its trade policy to the EU and that the UK had a ""unique global quality"" which meant it would be able to maximise the opportunities provided by Brexit.He said he regretted the fact that globalisation had become a ""boo word in the political lexicon"", saying it had been a ""liberating and enriching force"" in lifting millions out of poverty and contributing to peace and prosperity in Europe.The UK, he added, had an ""unrivalled opportunity"" to do a ""fantastic"" deal with the EU, given their trading standards, rules and tariffs were already harmonised. ""Of course we remain committed to our European markets, perhaps more so than ever but we need to think globally again because a global Britain is a safer, more successful and more prosperous Britain.""Ministers have said that although no new trade deals can be signed until the UK leaves the EU, a host of countries are keen to talk to the UK about the prospects."
2017-02-28,Rudd plea to Lords over Brexit rights,https://web.archive.org//web/20170228234449/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-39116896,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkMinisters have sought to reassure peers about the status of EU citizens in the UK after Brexit as they face possible defeat over the issue in the Lords.Home Secretary Amber Rudd has written to peers to say the UK cannot offer a unilateral guarantee on residency but it will be a priority once talks begin.She also said peers would have a say on future changes to migration rules.The Lords could inflict a defeat on the government when amendments to the Brexit bill are debated on Wednesday. Earlier this month, MPs passed unamended a bill which would give Theresa May the power to begin the Brexit process.They accepted assurances from ministers that protecting the rights of the 3 million UK nationals living in the UK would be a priority for ministers. But many peers want the government to go further and state that all EU nationals lawfully in the UK at the time of the referendum should be allowed to stay.In a letter to peers, Ms Rudd said such a guarantee, however ""well-intentioned"", would not help the hundreds of thousands of UK citizens living on the Continent as it could leave them in potential limbo if reciprocal assurances were not given by the EU's 27 other member states.BBC political editor Laura KuenssbergThe letter is not that different to what was sent to MPs previously to try to ease their minds, as the Article 50 legislation made its way through the House of Commons.It does though appear to kill off the idea that Theresa May will arbitrarily set a cut off date for EU immigration without having to get MPs or peers onside first. But it is unlikely to spare the government's blushes tomorrow. Without a further more dramatic concession, they are set to lose.That will set in train the first 'ping' of the potential 'ping pong' - the Parliamentary process where the Lords reject something in the red chamber, sending it back down the corridors to the green benches - daring, imploring perhaps, backbenchers to join with them and push back at the government.There is no sign at the moment that ministers want to budge on this issueRead more from Laura""We need to act fairly and provide certainty for both groups of people as quickly as possible and that will remain the government's position,"" she wrote.She suggested the inability to reach a mutual agreement was more a question of timing than principle and the UK and EU had a ""common goal"" in doing so if, as expected, the UK notifies the EU of its intention to leave by the end of March.""There is absolutely no question of treating EU citizens with anything other than the utmost respect,"" she wrote.""That's why we will be making securing their status a priority as soon as we trigger Article 50 and the negotiations begin.""I know some colleagues are concerned about how long this might take to resolve, but the government remains committed to providing reassurance to EU nationals here and UK nationals in the EU as a priority once Article 50 has been triggered.""Ms Rudd said that any changes to the status of existing EU residents and those coming from Europe in future would have to be approved by Parliament.""This will be done through a separate Immigration Bill and subsequent secondary legislation so nothing will change for any EU citizen, whether already resident in the UK or moving from the EU, without Parliament's approval.""She added: ""This isn't just about ensuring British businesses and our public sector have access to the right workers.""We owe it to those many European citizens who have contributed so much to this country to resolve this issue as soon as possible and give them the security they need to continue to contribute to this country.""Last week, peers gave an unopposed second reading to the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill.But the government - which does not have a majority in the Lords - is potentially more vulnerable to defeat now that specific amendments are being discussed. The Supreme Court ruled in January that the government requires the prior approval of both Houses of Parliament before it can trigger Article 50."
2017-02-28,Sturgeon warns of 'attack on devolution',https://web.archive.org//web/20170228234449/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-39116115,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkNicola Sturgeon has accused the UK government of using Brexit to launch an attack on devolution.In a speech in Edinburgh, the first minister said that the Scottish Parliament faced a ""grave threat"" after ""20 years of progress"". She also warned of a ""powerful Westminster faction"" which never accepted devolution and sees Brexit as an opportunity to ""rein in"" Holyrood. The UK government said Ms Sturgeon had completely misrepresented its position. And it said it had been ""very clear"" that no decisions currently taken by Holyrood will be taken away, and that more powers would be devolved once they return to the UK from Brussels.In her address to the David Hume Institute, Ms Sturgeon argued that Scotland voting to remain in the EU while the UK as a whole voted to leave had caused the ""democratic deficit"" which fuelled demand for a Scottish Parliament in the 1980s and 1990s to open up again. And she said that the Conservatives' actions in the wake of the EU referendum were seeking to ""fundamentally undermine the basis of the existing devolution settlement"".Ms Sturgeon added: ""The Brexit process has emboldened a now powerful Westminster faction, which never accepted devolution, and which now sees it as an opportunity to rein in the Scottish Parliament.""In place of a multinational United Kingdom democracy, they see Brexit as the way to claw back ground.""The first minister also claimed that recent statements by the UK government suggested elements of farming and fishing policy ""now risk being taken back to Westminster"" after Brexit, despite promises by the Leave campaign that they would be handed to Holyrood. She said: ""That would be utterly unacceptable. It would be a gross betrayal of the claims and promises made during the EU referendum campaign.""And more profoundly it would fundamentally undermine the basis of the existing devolution settlement.""So what we have is in effect an attack on the very foundations of the devolved parliament we voted for 20 years ago.""Ms Sturgeon has said a second referendum on Scottish independence would be the result of ""sheer intransigence"" on the part of the UK government.And she has insisted that her party has a ""cast-iron mandate"" to call another independence vote, justified by both the EU referendum result and the SNP's victory in last May's Holyrood election.She told the audience in Edinburgh: ""The UK government still has an opportunity to change course before it triggers the Article 50 process. I very much hope it does.""However if it doesn't, it will show that the democratic deficit which people voted to end in 1997 doesn't just endure - it continues to cause harm to Scotland's interests, to our international relationships, to our very sense of our own identity.""And so if those circumstances arise, proposing a further decision on independence wouldn't simply be legitimate, it would almost be a necessary way of giving the people of Scotland a say in our own future direction.""Responding to Ms Sturgeon's speech, a UK government spokesman said: ""These claims completely misrepresent the UK government's position. ""We have been very clear that no decisions currently taken by Holyrood will be taken away. ""We have also said that we will use the opportunity of bringing decision-making back to the UK to ensure that more decisions are devolved. ""As a result of the Scotland Act passed last year, Holyrood is becoming one of the most powerful devolved parliaments in the world. ""The only threat to devolution is the policy of taking Scotland out of the United Kingdom.""Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said the ""hyperbole from the first minister takes synthetic grievance to a whole new level"", adding: ""Frankly, she sounds shrill"". Ms Davidson said: ""Nicola Sturgeon's attempt to use Brexit to manufacture the case for a second referendum has quite simply failed.""She should now take it off the table so Scotland and the UK can work to get the best Brexit deal possible.""Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale accused Ms Sturgeon of ""ridiculous scaremongering"".She said: ""The Scottish Parliament has major new powers over tax and welfare, which the SNP simply refuses to use. ""While the Tories' reckless Brexit gamble will undoubtedly harm Scotland's economy, there is an opportunity to repatriate powers here from Brussels - including fishing and agriculture."""

I don't think some of the reasons put forward are compelling.""I'm very straightforward that if things don't improve there is no prospect of us winning a general election.""It is a very bad result for the Labour party and we need to be honest about that.""A number of things came up, including the direction of travel of the Labour Party, Labour's ability to communicate and understand what people are saying to them and, of course, the leadership of the Labour Party and we all know that.""

""If you vote for Mike, you will get Michelle, that's the reality.""Mr Nesbitt replied: ""People voted for you the last time and they got Martin McGuinness, and he wrote your resignation letter.""The debate, hosted by BBC Northern Ireland, featured the leaders of the five biggest parties at Stormont - the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), Sinn Féin, Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) and Alliance.Mr Eastwood said Mr Nesbitt was ""very brave"" to say he would give his second preference vote to the SDLP and added the public were ""way ahead"" of politicians on cross-community voting. ""I'm an Irish nationalist, Mike Nesbitt's an Ulster Unionist, I won't be any less of an Irish nationalist if I transfer across community.  It doesn't affect one iota my nationalism. I think it's the kind of politics that we need to be embracing.""Alliance leader Naomi Long said her party had ""fought every election"" on the basis of seeking cross-community support.""I am glad that other parties are talking about actually co-operating on the basis of doing so voluntarily rather than doing it, as others have said, holding their nose to go into government with each other.""She added that people are tired of being ""pulled back into the ditches"" and wanted to move forward.The snap election was called after a coalition led by the DUP and Sinn Féin collapsed over the handling of the RHI scheme.A lack of cost controls led to an overspend which could cost taxpayers £490m over the next 20 years.Sinn Féin's leader north of the border, Michelle O'Neill, said: ""I cannot go into government with Arlene Foster in the position of first or deputy first minister whilst there is a cloud hanging over her.  ""The full {RHI} investigation needs to report, but the public will have their say.""Asked if she would respect the DUP's mandate if voters support Mrs Foster, Mrs O'Neill told the debate she could not dictate who leads the DUP, but could dictate who her party enters government with.She said the DUP ""will have a choice to make"" after the election.Earlier in the debate, Mrs Foster said there was not a ""scintilla of evidence"" in relation to RHI allegations made against her.""Would it not have been more intelligent, would it not have been better to have had the public inquiry first and then had the election? Because then we would have had the full facts for everybody to make a judgement.""Speaking on BBC One Northern Ireland after the debate, leaders of Stormont's smaller parties were scathing about the performance of their larger rivals.Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister said: ""I think the audience saw that there is no prospect of those five parties providing durable, workable good government.""He added: ""If you vote for these five main parties, you get more of the same - the very thing that isn't working.""The debate was held ahead of polling day on 2 March."

With interest rates so low, he said there was an ""overwhelming case"" for government to borrow to fund spending on infrastructure, such as roads, rail and broadband.""The government has said schools and hospitals are going to be protected. That is simply not true. The NHS is suffering the biggest crisis since its foundation and schools are having the first budget cut per head since the 1970s.""This is an appalling situation.""Public spending as a share of GDP has fallen steadily since 2010 when it totalled 45%. This year's figure is forecast to be 40%. Mr Hammond has relaxed the government's fiscal targets since taking over in July, abandoning predecessor George Osborne's target of eliminating the deficit by 2020.But he has made clear that borrowing levels are still too high and that the government should be aiming to balance the books at some point in the 2020s.The Institute for Fiscal Studies has said meeting this target by 2025 would require up to £34bn in further spending cuts and tax rises.But ahead of his first Budget on 8 March, Mr Hammond is under pressure to increase spending on a number of fronts amid signs that stronger-than-expected tax receipts could give him additional room for manoeuvre.He is facing calls to rethink the revaluation of business rates in England which would see more than half a million firms pay higher annual bills.Labour wants £500m to be made available to help small businesses cope with the impact, warning that it could leave many High Streets a ""wasteland"".Several Tory MPs are pressing the government to make extra funding available for social care on top of what is already being promised.Speaking in the Commons on Monday, Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston said the effects of an ageing society, on top of underlying financial pressures, were creating a ""perfect storm"" for the health service.She said the NHS needed a cash ""lifeline"" in the Budget and that plugging gaps in day-to-day spending by re-allocating capital spending was a ""false economy"".The government is being warned that a further dose of austerity, without better financial planning and reform, could push some public services to ""breaking point"".In a new report, the Institute for Government and Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy said social care and prisons were in a cycle of ""crisis, cash, repeat"" and better use needed to be made of the money being spent."
2017-02-28,UKIP donor may fight Carswell for seat,https://web.archive.org//web/20170228234449/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-39114851,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkUKIP donor Arron Banks has suggested he could stand against the party's only MP Douglas Carswell at the next election.The two have been at loggerheads over UKIP's future direction and strategy.Mr Banks has called for the Clacton MP and a ""Tory cabal"" to be expelled - with ex-leader Nigel Farage also saying it was time for Mr Carswell ""to go"". Mr Carswell, who defected from the Tories to UKIP in 2014 and won the Essex seat at the 2015 election, said Mr Banks's plans were ""news to him"". The BBC understands party leader Paul Nuttall has asked his chairman Paul Oakden to meet Mr Carswell on Tuesday to ""discuss the situation"" amid growing questions about his future in the party.  Mr Carswell and Mr Banks have been engaged in a long-running feud. The latest development comes amid claims that Mr Carswell resisted attempts by senior UKIP figures to secure a knighthood for former leader Nigel Farage.The Daily Telegraph reported that in an email the MP suggested Mr Farage should settle instead for an OBE for ""services to headline writers"".On Monday, the MP, who has denied trying to block a knighthood for Mr Farage, alluded to the row when he tweeted ""knight night"". Following UKIP leader Paul Nuttall's failure to win the Stoke-on-Trent Central by-election last week, Mr Banks has said the party is at a ""crossroads"" and has offered to become party chairman in order to bring about a ""total rebrand"".He has said Mr Farage, who stepped down last year and has since spent much of his time in the United States, should be ""re-engaged"".Mr Banks has described Mr Carswell, whose relationship with Mr Farage is also strained, as a ""terrible individual who has done his best to destroy UKIP"". Mr Banks' office said he intended to stand in Clacton, the Essex seat which Mr Carswell won with a 3,437 majority in 2015. It is not clear whether he will seek the UKIP nomination himself or will stand as an independent.Mr Farage has claimed the party's only MP has been ""totally disconnected"" from UKIP since February 2015 and it was time for him to sever his links entirely.""From the date of the result of the general election, he has actively been working against UKIP,"" Mr Farage wrote about Mr Carswell in the Daily Telegraph.""I think there is little future for UKIP with him staying inside this party. The time for him to go is now,"" he added.Mr Farage told the BBC: ""If Paul [Nuttall] is constantly contradicted and dragged in the wrong direction by our one MP, that's not where he should be.""MEP Bill Etheridge has also said Mr Carswell should lose the party whip as he was ""not compatible with what UKIP is trying to achieve"". He told Radio 5 live that Mr Carswell should ""look elsewhere"" for his political future. He told Radio 4's World at One the situation was ""not a party at war it is one man... who has gone out of his way to subvert the party's leadership"".""I'm not suggesting that Douglas isn't a good MP he just doesn't have the UKIP principles at heart,"" Mr Etheridge said.But UKIP Welsh Assembly member Mark Reckless said Mr Carswell should stay, saying ""we have got to learn from him"" as he won a Parliamentary election.Mr Carswell, who has urged the party to project a more positive image and tone down its rhetoric on immigration, has warmer relations with Mr Nuttall and several of his key advisers.Current UKIP chairman, Paul Oakden, said after the Stoke result that it might be years before his party can pick up another seat via a by-election.Mr Banks criticised Mr Nuttall's tactics in the Stoke campaign, saying he wrongly adopted a ""red UKIP"" strategy, copying Labour policies on the NHS.The businessman has said UKIP needs to become more professional if it is to make further headway, saying that as chairman he would oversee a new membership drive, and install a new team of ""trained professional agents"" to focus on target seats.Unless this happened, he has suggested he could turn his back on the party."
2017-02-28,Deal struck over BHS pension scheme,https://web.archive.org//web/20170228234449/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-39118566,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkSir Philip Green has agreed a £363m cash settlement with the Pensions Regulator to plug the gap in the BHS pension scheme.Workers will get the same starting pension that they were originally promised.It brings to a close a long-running negotiation over benefits for former workers of the collapsed retailer.The regulator had launched enforcement action against Sir Philip and other former owners of BHS.Sir Philip, who had promised to ""sort"" the pension scheme, said: ""I have today made a voluntary contribution of up to £363m to enable the trustees of the BHS Pension schemes to achieve a significantly better outcome than the schemes entering the Pension Protection Fund (PPF), which was the goal from the outset. ""The settlement follows lengthy, complex discussions with the Pensions Regulator and the PPF, both of which are satisfied with the solution that has been offered.""All relevant notices, including legal matters and claims from the regulator, have been withdrawn, bringing this matter to a conclusion."" The tycoon, who with his wife Cristina is estimated by Forbes to be worth £3.8bn, said: ""Once again I would like to apologise to the BHS pensioners for this last year of uncertainty, which was clearly never the intention when the business was sold in March 2015.""I hope that this solution puts their minds at rest and closes this sorry chapter for them.""The negotiations centred on getting the 19,000 members of the scheme a pension that was closer to the one they were originally promised. Usually, failed pension schemes are rescued by the Pension Protection Fund, which pays out a reduced amount.Had the PPF taken on the scheme, members aged under 60 would have seen a 10% reduction in their starting pension. Following Sir Philip's cash injection, they will now be transferred to a new scheme with the same starting pension that they had originally been promised.Subsequent payments will not be as generous as they had originally thought had the retailer survived, owing to less inflation protection. On average, the new scheme will offer members of around 88% of the value of their full BHS scheme benefits. Yet, these long-term payouts are better than they would have been under the PPF. Benefits payable in retirement and built up prior to April 1997 will increase at 1.8% per year.Members can opt to take a lump sum if they have a pension pot of up to £18,000.There will be no cap on pension payouts, which would have been the case under the PPF and would have hit those with bigger pensions.Current pensioners will also receive a lump sum to make up for any underpaid pension benefits since March 2016, when the scheme, in effect, was under PPF rules during an assessment period.The Pensions Regulator chief executive Lesley Titcomb described the deal as ""strong"". ""Throughout our discussions with Sir Philip and his team, we have always been clear that we were determined to achieve the right outcome for members of the schemes, both in terms of the amount and the structure of the settlement.""There was an estimated £571m hole in the BHS pension covering all future payouts. The potential of taking on such a burden was seen as one of the reasons that BHS failed to find backers or buyers for the business at a whole.In practical terms, the hit to the PPF of taking on the scheme would have been £275m or more.Sir Philip initially offered £250m, but the regulator had sought at least £350m - an ambition that it has now achieved. Another £20m from Sir Philip is being used to cover expenses.MPs had also called for the Topshop billionaire to be stripped of his knighthood. He was grilled by a committee of MPs over the sale of the chain, which he owned for 15 years before selling it for £1 to former bankrupt Dominic Chappell. Mr Chappell is still being pursued by the regulator.Anne and Keith Bostock, from Stockport, met while working at BHS. She worked in customer services, and he was on the tills and in deliveries.Anne worked for BHS for 42 years, and Keith for six.""A lot of pensioners will feel a bit better about it, but it has taken a long time,"" said Keith, regarding the deal.""It is a case of doing just enough to keep him [Sir Philip] out of trouble.""I am hopeful they will still get rid of his knighthood. He is projecting the wrong image for business.""Frank Field, who chairs the Work and Pensions Select Committee and who had suggested the retail tycoon's yacht could be seized to help shore up the pension fund, said: ""I very much welcome this out-of-court settlement, which is an important milestone in gaining the justice for BHS pensioners and former workers that we have been pushing for since beginning our inquiry into the downfall of BHS.""I think there are a lot of other issues which are not solved by this which we will obviously be looking at and the courts and everybody else will be.""It is not justice, but it is a milestone.""Chris Martin, chairman of the BHS Pension Trustees, said: ""The injection of cash from Sir Philip puts the new scheme on a stable footing."" He said members would be contacted to be updated on their options.Are you a BHS pension holder? Do you think this is enough?

2017-02-28,MEPs to debate EU citizens' rights,https://web.archive.org//web/20170228234449/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-parliaments-39118452,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkMembers of the European Parliament are set to debate the requirements for EU citizens to get the right to permanently live in the UK. An oral question expresses concern about reports that the UK is ""restrictively"" applying the rules for gaining residence status. Currently, the UK insists certain EU citizens must have personal health insurance in order to qualify as legally resident after three months. It comes as many EU citizens apply for the permanent right to stay following the Brexit vote last year. The requirement for health insurance applies to EU citizens that are not working, self-employed or qualify as looking or work. As such, students and full-time parents are among those most likely to be affected by the obligation. The Home Office says that having the right to use NHS services does not count.Although the requirement has existed for a number of years, a number of EU citizens say they were not aware of it. While the Home Office does not remove people without insurance, it could hamper the ability of some to apply for permanent status. EU nationals need to have lived lawfully in the UK, continuously for five years, to automatically get permanent residency rights.  For some, the requirement for ""lawful"" residence may include having personal medical insurance.Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston is among those backing an online petition calling on the UK government to scrap the requirement. However, the measure was upheld by the Court of Appeal after a case in 2014. Among those pushing for a debate on the matter in the European Parliament is Dutch MEP Sophia in't Veld, who has previously said the rejection rate for residency applications in the UK is ""completely unreasonable"".She is reportedly aiming to lead a group of MEPs who will investigate the experiences of EU nationals applying for permanent status and citizenship. The Liberal Democrats claim that around 28% of permanent residency requests in the second half of last year were rejected or declared invalid. The Home Office has denied that refusal rates have changed over the last year. The European Parliament's civil liberties committee is also due to take evidence on the experience of EU citizens in the UK, as well as British nationals resident in other part of the EU. You can watch the debate on Wednesday 1 March live on the BBC Parliaments online page. "
2017-02-28,'Delay Brexit' if no trade deal reached,https://web.archive.org//web/20170228234449/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-39111813,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkBrexit should be delayed if no trade deal can be struck with the EU by the end of the two-year negotiating process, business leaders have said.The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) also wants businesses to continue to be allowed to recruit skilled and low-skilled EU workers after the UK leaves.The business organisation is holding its annual conference on Tuesday.Theresa May has said she will trigger Article 50 by the end of March which would start the process of leaving.The BCC said completing a trade deal within the two years allowed by Article 50 would be the ""ideal outcome"".But it continued: ""Should this prove impossible, we should seek an extension to the negotiating period to enable completion of both agreements concurrently.""However, such an extension would only be possible if all EU member states agree.Business Secretary Greg Clark and shadow chancellor John McDonnell will be among those addressing the conference in London.BCC director general Adam Marshall said: ""Business communities across the UK want practical considerations, not ideology or politics, at the heart of the government's approach to Brexit negotiations.""What's debated in Westminster often isn't what matters for most businesses.""Most firms care little about the exact process for triggering Article 50, but they care a lot about an unexpected VAT hit to their cash flow, sudden changes to regulation, the inability to recruit the right people for the job, or if their products are stopped by customs authorities at the border."" BBC business correspondent Jonty BloomIt's on immigration that the BCC is most likely to be disappointed. It's calling for its members to be able to recruit across the EU after Brexit with minimal bureaucracy, costs or barriers. But it's difficult to see how that is compatible with the government's stated aim of bringing immigration down to tens of thousands a year.Or how it could square with the prime minister's recent declaration that Brexit must mean control of the number of people who come to Britain from Europe.The BCC's comments come after former Prime Minister Sir John Major warned that the chances of no agreement being reached within the time limit were ""very high"".In a speech, he warned that an ""unreal and over-optimistic"" vision of Brexit was being put forward.Downing Street said the government was determined to make a success of Brexit."

2017-02-28,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20170228234449/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThis article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide to the UK's vote to leave the European Union. It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 52% to 48%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who resigned on the day after losing the referendum. Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she says she will respect the will of the people. She has said ""Brexit means Brexit"" but there is still a lot of debate about what that will mean in practice especially on the two key issues of how British firms do business in the European Union and what curbs are brought in on the rights of European Union nationals to live and work in the UK. She set out more details of her negotiating hopes in her key speech on Brexit.The UK economy appears to have weathered the initial shock of the Brexit vote, although the value of the pound remains near a 30-year low, but opinion is sharply divided over the long-term effects of leaving the EU. Some major firms such as Easyjet and John Lewis have pointed out that the slump in sterling has increased their costs. Britain also lost its top AAA credit rating, meaning the cost of government borrowing will be higher. But share prices have recovered from a dramatic slump in value, with both the FTSE 100 and the broader FTSE 250 index, which includes more British-based businesses, trading higher than before the referendum. The Bank of England cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - a record low and the first cut since 2009 - after the vote and there has not been the economic slump or recession that some had predicted. The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it has to invoke an agreement called Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May has said she intends to trigger this process by the end of March 2017, meaning the UK will be expected to have left by the summer of 2019, depending on the precise timetable agreed during the negotiations. The government will also enact a Great Repeal Bill which will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. It is expected to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove.After a court battle, the UK's Supreme Court ruled in January that Parliament must be consulted before Article 50 is invoked. This is why a two line Brexit bill is currently making its way through Parliament. MPs have approved it after Labour MPs were told to support it. It has got through its first House of Lords debate with debate and votes on possible changes expected in the next week.Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These men - dubbed the Three Brexiteers - will play a central role in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although it will be Mrs May, as prime minister, who will have the final say. David Cameron's government did not do any emergency planning for Brexit ahead of the referendum and Mrs May has rejected calls to say what her negotiating goals are.Once Article 50 has been triggered, the UK will have two years to negotiate its withdrawal. But no one really knows how the Brexit process will work - Article 50 was only created in late 2009 and it has never been used. Former Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, now Chancellor, wanted Britain to remain in the EU, and he has suggested it could take up to six years for the UK to complete exit negotiations. The terms of Britain's exit will have to be agreed by 27 national parliaments, a process which could take some years, he has argued. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. The UK will continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making.Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Following Theresa May's Brexit recent speech we now know that the UK is not intending to stay in the EU's single market. Although there has been speculation for months about the issue, it would have meant the UK staying under the auspices of the European Court of Justice and having to allow unlimited EU immigration, under freedom of movement rules.Both sides want trade to continue after Brexit with the UK seeking a positive outcome for those who wish to trade goods and services"" - such as those in the City of London and wanting a ""comprehensive free trade deal"" giving the UK ""the greatest possible access"" to the single market. Mrs May says she wants the UK to reach a new customs union deal with the EU. A customs union is where countries agree not to impose tariffs on each others' goods and have a common tariff on goods coming in from elsewhere. The UK is currently part of the EU customs union but that stops the UK being able to do its own trade deals with other countries. Reality Check: How could customs union work?These terms have increasingly been used as debate focused on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people in order to maintain access to the EU single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result.The government has declined to give a firm guarantee about the status of EU nationals currently living in the UK, saying this is not possible without a reciprocal pledge from other EU members about the millions of British nationals living on the continent. EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, will be be able to stay, the chief civil servant at the Home Office has said. The rights of other EU nationals would be subject to negotiations on Brexit and the ""will of Parliament"", he added.A lot depends on the kind of deal the UK agrees with the EU. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions on EU nationals, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.Again, it depends on whether the UK government decides to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages. Citizens' Advice has reminded people their rights have not changed yet and asked anyone to contact them if they think they have been discriminated against following the Leave vote.Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested EU migrants who come to the UK as Brexit nears may not be given the right to stay. He has said there might have to be a cut-off point if there was a ""surge"" in new arrivals.People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote. The day-to-day spending impact is likely to be more significant. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it to remain at least 10% below where it was on 23 June, in the long term. This means imported goods will consequently get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have already been seen and the issue was most notably illustrated by the dispute between Tesco and Marmite's makers about whether prices would be put up or not in the stores.The latest UK inflation figures, for January, showed the CPI inflation rate rising to 1.8%, its highest level for two and a half years, with signs of more cost pressures set to feed through in the months to come.Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration.She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations. As mentioned above, the key issue is whether other EU nations will grant the UK access to the single market, if that is what it wants, while at the same time being allowed to restrict the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK.Mrs May has said she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. It is currently running at 330,000 a year, of which 184,000 are EU citizens, and 188,000 are from outside the EU - the figures include a 39,000 outflow of UK citizens.It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Liberal Democrats - who have just a handful of MPs - have vowed to halt Brexit and keep Britain in the EU if they were to win the next general election.Some commentators, including former House of Commons clerk Lord Lisvane, have argued that a further referendum would be needed to ratify whatever deal the UK hammers out with the EU, but there are few signs political leaders view this as a viable option.Yes. Theresa May has appeared keen to avoid a vote on her negotiating stance, to avoid having to give away her priorities, but Theresa May has said there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. It is worth mentioning that any deal also has to be agreed by the European Parliament - with British MEPs getting a chance to vote on it there.  While there could be limitations on British nationals' ability to live and work in EU countries, it seems unlikely they would want to deter tourists. There are many countries outside the European Economic Area, which includes the 28 EU nations plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway, that British citizens can visit for up to 90 days without needing a visa and it is possible that such arrangements could be negotiated with European countries.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. In theory, the government could, if it wanted, decide to change the colour, which is currently standardised for EU countries, says the BBC's Europe correspondent, Chris Morris.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketNo nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it is ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faces being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. A second independence referendum for the country is now ""highly likely"", she has said, although not in 2017. She has said she wants Scotland to stay in the single market and said Mrs May's decision to rule out the UK staying in the single market ""undoubtedly"" brings the referendum closer.Before his resignation Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said the impact in Northern Ireland would be ""very profound"" and that the whole island of Ireland should now be able to vote on reunification. But, speaking while she was still Northern Ireland Secretary, Theresa Villiers ruled out the call from Sinn Féin for a border poll, saying the circumstances in which one would be called did not exist. The land border is likely to be a key part of the Brexit talks. Theresa May said a priority for her would be negotiating a deal with the EU which allowed a common travel area between the UK and the Republic of Ireland.During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest. But his successor Theresa May has said she will keep it in place, at least for the current Parliament, which is due to last until 2020.So far there has been a cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. There are yet to be signs that rising inflation have worried the Bank of England  enough to consider raising interest rates.  But if that happened it would make mortgages and loans more expensive to repay - but would be good news for savers.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.Eurotunnel boss Jacques Gounon said last November the reintroduction of duty-free would be ""an incredible boost for my business"" but he later said  that remark had been ""light-hearted"". Erik Juul-Mortensen, president of the Tax Free World Association (TFWA) said after the referendum vote ""it is not possible to predict how Brexit will affect the duty free and travel retail industry, and it is wiser not to make assumptions about exactly what the impact will be.""  They are at the moment but no-one knows the longer term prospects for definite. The EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - is not an EU initiative. It was negotiated between countries within a group known as the European Economic Area, often simply referred to as the single market (plus Switzerland, which confusingly is not a member of the EEA, but has agreed access to the single market). Therefore, the future of Britons' EHIC cover could depend on whether the UK decided to sever ties with the EEA.Probably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report. In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two-thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.However, the UK government is committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, the UK government is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR. However, the EU has its own European Court of Justice, whose decisions are binding on EU institutions and member states.Its rulings have sometimes caused controversy in Britain and supporters of a Brexit have called for immediate legislation to curb its powers. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also cited sovereignty and democracy, and they wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Four of the biggest US banks have committed to helping maintain the City's position. But HSBC will move up to 1,000 jobs to Paris, the BBC understands. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Pest control firm Rentokil Initial says it could make £15m extra this year thanks to a weaker currency.Others are less optimistic. Hilary Jones, a director at UK cosmetics firm Lush said the company was ""terrified"" about the economic impact. She added that while the firm's Dorset factory would continue to produce goods for the UK market, products for the European market may be made at its new plant in Germany.Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After the Leave vote, the government will probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""As with most elements of the UK economy, not enough solid data has been published yet to accurately conclude the Brexit effect on house prices. Industry figures have pointed to ""uncertainty"" among buyers and sellers that could potentially change the housing market.So far, the most significant research has come from the respected Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which has published the conclusions of a survey of its members. This primarily records sentiment among surveyors.It found that house prices are expected to fall across the UK in the three months after the referendum vote. However, the dip in prices is only expected to persist over the 12 months from June in London and East Anglia, surveyors predict.House prices were already slowing in central London, owing to the fall-out from changes to stamp duty rules in April.Separate figures from property portal Rightmove suggested the average asking price of houses coming on to the market in England and Wales fell by 0.9%, or £2,647, in July compared with June. It said that agents had reported very few sales had fallen through as a result of the vote.Many potential first-time buyers would welcome a fall in house prices, with ownership among the young falling owing to affordability concerns. Investors in property, or those who have paid off a mortgage and hope to leave homes as inheritance would be unhappy with a long-term reduction in value.  Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law following the decision to leave the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" will not necessarily disappear overnight - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU means the UK will not be part of TTIP. It will have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Former Labour health secretary Lord Owen has said that because of TTIP (see answer above) the only way to protect the NHS from further privatisation was to get out of the EU."

2017-02-28,Who's Who: Theresa May's cabinet,https://web.archive.org//web/20170228234449/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36785814,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkTheresa May is forming her new government after becoming Conservative prime minister. She is continuing to announce her full cabinet - but here's what we know so far. The list will be updated as new appointments are made. Campaigned to Remain in the European Union The former home secretary, 59, becomes the UK's second female prime minister in the wake of David Cameron's resignation after the EU referendum. She had previously served in the Home Office for more than six years. Theresa May: Full profileHow does May's cabinet compare to Cameron's?Campaigned to Leave the EUBoris Johnson succeeds Philip Hammond at the Foreign Office. The former London mayor headed the campaign for the UK to leave the European Union. He did not previously have a ministerial appointment in Mr Cameron's government but accepted an invitation to attend political cabinet. He was not running any department. Mr Johnson, 52, may be one of the best known politicians in the country but the move to foreign secretary is a big step up from his previous role.Read how the world has reacted.Leave campaignerDavid Davis has been appointed to the new cabinet position of secretary of state for exiting the European Union - or ""Brexit secretary"". A veteran Eurosceptic, he has previously held the positions of Conservative party chairman and shadow deputy prime minister. Between 2003 and 2008, he was the shadow home secretary under both Michael Howard and David Cameron. Mr Davis, 67, lost to David Cameron in the 2005 Tory leadership contest. Details about the new Brexit department are still emerging, but it is likely to take the lead in negotiating Britain's departure from the EU and unpicking the thousands of pages of EU rules written into UK law.Theresa May is reported to have ordered civil servants to find a building for the new department.Leave campaignerLiam Fox, 54, has taken on another newly created position as secretary of state for international trade. He was made secretary of state for defence in 2010 but resigned in 2011 over allegations he had given a close friend, lobbyist Adam Werritty, access to the Ministry of Defence and allowed him to join official trips overseas.Like Mr Davis he is a Eurosceptic who voted to leave the EU and he also stood unsuccessfully for the Conservative Party leadership in 2005.He stood again in the latest race to be leader but was eliminated in the first ballot after winning the support of just 16 MPs.Remain campaignerThe appointment to chief whip is a big step up for Gavin Williamson, according to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg.David Cameron's former parliamentary private secretary, he also served as parliamentary private secretary to transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin.The 40-year-old from North Yorkshire was elected MP for South Staffordshire in 2010. As chief whip, he will attend Cabinet meetings.Remain campaignerKaren Bradley takes over from the deposed John Whittingdale as Culture, Media and Sport Secretary. She had been working with Theresa May as a Home Office minister since 2014.She was first elected MP for Staffordshire Moorlands in May 2010.Her appointment comes two months after Mr Whittingdale and the BBC agreed a major overhaul of the corporation.Read more about her appointment here.Leave campaignerAndrea Leadsom, the Conservative leadership candidate who dramatically pulled out of the race, is the new Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Secretary.The prominent Brexit backer is promoted from energy minister to a cabinet role which will see her take responsibility for a farming industry as it faces the end of European Union subsidies. She will also have to fashion a post-Brexit fisheries policy. Green campaigners will be watching carefully to see what happens to environment regulations in areas including wildlife habitats, air pollution and water quality, currently governed by rules from Europe. Mrs Leadsom's public reason for withdrawing from the leadership race was to allow a rapid transition at the top, and give the economy certainty in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. But our political editor Laura Kuenssberg says her friends were saying she was alarmed by the level of scrutiny given to her comments on motherhood reported in the Times.Read more on Mrs Leadsom's motivations for stepping aside here.Baroness Evans of Bowes Park becomes leader of the House of Lords at 40, in her first ministerial role since being ennobled by David Cameron in 2014.She attended London's Henrietta Barnett School and Cambridge University before becoming deputy director of the Conservative research department, deputy director of the Policy Exchange think-tank and chief operating officer of the New Schools Network - the organisation which ran Michael Gove's free schools programme.Remain campaignerDamian Green is appointed the new Work and Pensions Secretary, taking over from Stephen Crabb, who earlier resigned.Mr Green served as an Immigration Minister and Justice Secretary in the coalition government but has been on the backbenches since 2014.Leave campaignerPriti Patel is the new International Development Secretary, a promotion from her role as employment minister which she's held for just a year.Ms Patel became MP for Witham in 2010 and joined the front bench as a Treasury minister in 2014.She is no stranger to controversy, having previously advocated bringing back the death penalty and was accused of ""divide and rule politics"" during the referendum campaign for claiming that ""biased"" immigration policy prevents curry chefs from outside the EU from working in the UK.On her appointment, she immediately faced calls to guarantee the UK's legal commitment to spending 0.7% of GDP on overseas aid.Remain campaignerGreg Clark is secretary of state of a newly-created ministry of business, energy and industrial strategy.His appointment spells the end for a department which put climate change at the top of the agenda.Just eight years after it was created by then-prime minister Gordon Brown, the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) is being merged into Mr Clark's new department and losing the ""climate change"" part of its name.Environmentalists immediately expressed concern that the reshaping of departments showed the government was downgrading climate change as a priority.But Richard Black, director of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU), said Mr Clark's move was ""an excellent appointment"", saying he ""understands climate change, and has written influential papers on the benefits of Britain developing a low-carbon economy"".Remain campaignerJames Brokenshire, who has been working with Theresa May at the Home Office - where he was immigration minister - has been made Northern Ireland Secretary.He takes over from Theresa Villiers, who resigned from the cabinet having been offered another role but saying it was not one ""which I felt I could take on"". Before entering parliament Mr Brokenshire was a partner at a large international law firm.From 2011 to 2015, he served as security minister at the Home Office with responsibility for domestic national security and counter terrorism. This included supporting the home secretary with oversight of the work of MI5 and the national police counter-terrorism network.His responsibilities also included the government's counter-terrorism strategy and he was part of the prime minister's ""extremism taskforce"". He also led negotiations with the Jordanian government to secure the deportation of the radical cleric Abu Qatada.Read more on his appointment here.Remain campaignerDavid Lidington, former Europe Minister, is promoted to Leader of the House. He had been Europe Minister since 2010 but moves across to a post involving the smooth running of the Commons. The Cambridge history graduate and father-of-four has been MP for Aylesbury since 1992. He previously worked for BP and mining firm Rio Tinto.Campaigned to Remain in the EUPhilip Hammond has been named chancellor of the exchequer. He was foreign secretary under David Cameron from 2014 to 2016, having previously served as defence secretary and transport secretary. He replaces George Osborne.Mr Hammond, 60, is seen at Westminster as the ultimate safe pair of hands. Sometimes mocked as ""box office Phil"" for what some see as his dull delivery, he forged a reputation in the shadow Treasury team as the Tories' public spending ""axeman"".He was seen as a Eurosceptic who spoke of withdrawal if the EU were not reformed, but was a Remain campaigner in the referendum. He now has the job of steering Britain's economy through the choppy post-Brexit waters.Read what Mr Hammond has to say on his first day in the job.Remain campaignerAmber Rudd has been made home secretary, filling the vacancy left by Mrs May. Ms Rudd was formerly energy and climate change secretary, a position she held for just one year.During the campaign for Remain in the EU referendum, she warned in a TV debate that she would not trust the new Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson to drive her home at the end of a night out.The former investment banker, venture capitalist, and financial journalist, aged 52, decided to enter politics in her 40s in order to get ""a grip on her life"". She quickly joined the fast track to the top after being elected to Parliament as MP for Hastings and Rye. She was seen as a protege of then Chancellor George Osborne, serving as his parliamentary private secretary before being promoted to junior minister at the Energy and Climate Change department in 2014. Remain campaignerLiz Truss moves from her role as secretary for environment, food and rural affairs to replace Michael Gove as justice secretary.A qualified management accountant, she became MP for South West Norfolk in 2010 and was appointed education minister in 2012.She was brought up in Yorkshire and attended Roundhay, a comprehensive school in Leeds, and went on to read philosophy, politics and economics at Merton College, Oxford.Socially liberal, the 40-year-old was a founder member of the free enterprise group of Conservative MPs arguing for more deregulation of the economy.Remain campaignerJustine Greening has said she is ""absolutely delighted"" to be made the new education secretary, taking over from Nicky Morgan. She was also appointed minister for women and equalities. Her new department will also take on higher and further education, skills and apprenticeships.Ms Greening leaves her international development secretary post, which she was promoted to in October 2011.MP for Putney since 2005, she became economic secretary to the Treasury after the 2010 election, succeeding Philip Hammond as transport secretary after he was promoted to defence secretary.At London's Pride day on 25 June, two days after the Brexit vote, the 47-year-old announced in a tweet she was in a same-sex relationship, saying ""I campaigned for Stronger In but sometimes you're better off out!"".Read more about what's awaiting Ms Greening at the education department.Leave campaignerChris Grayling, Theresa May's leadership campaign chief, has been appointed transport secretary. He was formerly Leader of the House.The most pressing jobs in his in-tray include dealing with the travel chaos caused by Southern Rail's disrupted services, the expansion of airport capacity in south-east England and high speed rail link, HS2.He's got some experience in this department, having served as shadow transport secretary from December 2005 to 2007.The Brexiteer had a surprisingly low-key, restrained referendum, largely refraining from ""blue-on-blue"" attacks. He was also one of the few Vote Leave spokesmen to share a platform with former UKIP leader Nigel Farage. Remain campaignerPatrick McLoughlin leaves his role as transport secretary to become Conservative Party chairman and chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.An MP since 1986, the former miner also served as chief whip, after being appointed to the role in David Cameron's first cabinet.As transport secretary, he was in charge of several large-scale projects including Crossrail and HS2. The 58-year-old said he was ""very pleased indeed"" with his new role.Remain campaignerSajid Javid is moved sideways from business secretary to secretary of the department for communities and local government.Mr Javid, considered a protege of former chancellor George Osborne's, held the culture secretary position before being appointed to the business role last year and is a former managing director of Deutsche Bank. The 46-year-old University of Exeter graduate stood on a ""joint ticket"" with Stephen Crabb for the leadership election, hoping to be chancellor if Mr Crabb had become PM.Remain campaignerMichael Fallon has kept his job at the Ministry of Defence - a position the 64-year-old has held since 2014.He was Conservative MP for Darlington from 1983 to 1992 - initially during Margaret Thatcher's time in Downing Street - and after leaving Parliament, he was later re-elected as MP for Sevenoaks in 1997.A former Conservative Party deputy chairman, he has previously served as energy and business minister, and before that secretary of state for business and enterprise.Seen as a safe pair of hands in Westminster, he described himself as a ""pretty reluctant Remainer"" after the EU referendum.Remain campaignerDespite earlier speculation, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt remains in his post.The 49-year-old was appointed culture secretary in David Cameron's first coalition government, a role he held for two years - including while London played host to the 2012 Olympic Games.He took over the health portfolio following a cabinet reshuffle in 2012, and described the appointment as the ""biggest privilege of my life"". Most recently, Mr Hunt has been locked in a battle with the British Medical Association over a new contract for junior doctors, which has led to a series of strikes.Remain campaignerDavid Mundell will continue as Secretary of State for Scotland.Mr Mundell, the only Scottish Conservative MP, said his focus was now on ""ensuring Scotland gets the best possible deal out of the EU negotiations"".Former prime minister David Cameron first appointed Mr Mundell to the post when he held his Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale seat for the third consecutive election in 2015.Remain campaignerMay's cabinet: Who's in and who's out? Alun Cairns, MP for the Vale of Glamorgan, remains in his cabinet role as secretary of state for Wales.He was appointed to the post just four months ago so there was little surprise that he will retain his position. The 45-year-old, who was born in Swansea and is a graduate of the University of Wales, Newport, was elected as MP for the Vale of Glamorgan in 2010. He worked in banking for a decade before his election to the Welsh Assembly. Remain campaignerGeorge Osborne has been fired as chancellor.He had been in the Treasury since 2010 - throughout David Cameron's tenure in Downing Street. He had also been first secretary of state since May 2015. A key ally of Mr Cameron, Mr Osborne tweeted it had been a ""privilege"" to be chancellor, adding: ""Others will judge - I hope I've left the economy in a better state than I found it.""Leave campaignerMichael Gove has been fired as justice secretary. The former Times journalist also served under David Cameron as education secretary in the coalition government, and as chief whip.He successfully campaigned for Brexit alongside Boris Johnson - but later withdrew his support for his colleague to be Conservative leader and prime minister, instead standing himself. He was eliminated in the final round of voting by MPs in third place.His surprise move to stand for the leadership and therefore to become prime minister effectively dashed Mr Johnson's hopes of running.Remain campaignerNicky Morgan is to leave her post as education secretary. The 43-year-old, who qualified as a lawyer, became an MP in 2010 and rose to the cabinet position of minister for women and equalities in 2013.London-born Ms Morgan replaced Michael Gove as education secretary in 2014. She reportedly considered standing in the Conservative leadership contest, but ultimately threw her support behind leave campaigner Mr Gove, despite campaigning for a Remain vote herself.In a tweet, she said she was ""disappointed"" not to be continuing her work in the education department, before congratulating her successor Justine Greening, saying she was ""committed to excellence in education"".Remain campaignerWork and Pensions Secretary Stephen Crabb has resigned from government ""in the best interests of my family"". He was one of the four contenders who lost out to Theresa May for the Conservative leadership.BBC political correspondent Vicki Young says it's not yet known whether Mr Crabb was offered a post he did not want or had just decided to resign from the government, possibly following some newspaper stories about his private life at the weekend. Read more about Mr Crabb here.Leave campaignerJohn Whittingdale has left his post as culture secretary. The Leave campaigner was vice-chairman of the influential group of Tory MPs called the 1922 Committee until he took over the portfolio for culture, media and sport after the general election in 2015 from Sajid Javid.In a tweet, he said it had been ""a privilege"" to serve as culture secretary, and wished his successor ""every success"".  Leave campaignerTheresa Villiers steps down as Northern Ireland secretary, saying she declined an offer of another role from the new prime minister.Former barrister Ms Villiers, MP for Chipping Barnet, had held the Northern Ireland portfolio since 2012. Prior to that, she was a Member of the European Parliament for six years.In December 2005, Mr Cameron promoted her to shadow chief secretary to the Treasury. In 2007, she was made a shadow transport minister, a brief she continued to hold when the coalition came to power.She was among prominent figures who campaigned for Brexit.

2017-02-28,A tale of two coups,https://web.archive.org//web/20170228234449/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-39113671,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe shadow chancellor John McDonnell has been warning left-wing members of Labour that there is a ""soft coup"" aimed at weakening then toppling Jeremy Corbyn.Writing for Labour Briefing he said: ""It's planned, co-ordinated and fully resourced. It is being perpetrated by an alliance between elements in the Labour Party and the Murdoch media empire, both intent on destroying Jeremy Corbyn and all that he stands for.""The coup is not being waged up front in public but strictly behind the scenes.""But soon after publication, his spokesman pointed out that the article had been written - although not published - before the party's defeat in the Copeland by-election, adding that the shadow chancellor was now calling for ""unity.""And shadow cabinet member Barry Gardiner told the BBC that Mr McDonnell's comments were prompted by ""frustration"" at what was seen as an unhelpful contribution from the former party leader Tony Blair on Europe - ahead of by-elections in two Brexit-backing areas.So is there really a coup being plotted against Mr Corbyn?Well, yes - but not in the conventional sense.Last year, more than eight out of ten Labour MPs voted for a motion of no confidence in Mr Corbyn, but still failed to oust him when the increasingly left-wing membership simply re-elected him, and with a bigger mandate than before.His opponents won't be taking that road again, because it is still likely to be a dead end.Instead, a slower diversionary route is being seen by some as the way forward.One of Mr Corbyn's staunchest backers has been Len McCluskey, the leader of Britain's biggest union, Unite.His former flatmate Tom Watson - Labour's deputy leader - failed to persuade Mr McCluskey in turn to persuade Mr Corbyn to agree a leaving date from the party leadership last summer.But Mr McCluskey is up for re-election at the end of April and is being challenged by West Midlands organiser Gerard Coyne, who is politically to his right.Mr Coyne's initial pitch was that the union was too focused on Westminster politics under Mr McCluskey and not enough on members' interests.But following the Copeland defeat, he has more explicitly attacked Mr McCluskey and Mr Corbyn - accusing the former of wasting members' money propping up the latter and calling for loans made to Mr Corbyn's re-election campaign to be repaid rather than written off.The implication is that a Coyne-led union wouldn't be funding a Corbyn-led Labour Party and that a new general secretary of Unite would apply pressure on the Labour leader to stand down.However, some of Mr Corbyn's critics at Westminster believe the Coyne campaign so far has had too subtle a message to gain prominent media coverage and should be more explicit about wanting to see the Labour leader deposed.So far, these Corbyn critics aren't confident that Mr Coyne will succeed in his bid to become the next general secretary of Unite. And - frankly - even if he does, he might be constrained by a more left-wing union executive if he were to try to pull the plug on the current party leadership.So the real battle is being waged largely beneath the radar at the party's grassroots.And it is Mr Corbyn's supporters who are being accused of trying to mount a coup.Mr Corbyn's opponents say the real coup is the one being plotted by those close to the leadership.They argue that those on the left of the party want to change Labour irrevocably and ensure it can't return to its Blairite past.While polling suggests that Mr Corbyn isn't a popular leader, the argument goes that the left can't afford to ditch him unless an equally left-wing leader could be guaranteed to succeed him.So the ""coup"" that Mr Corbyn's critics would point to is this: an attempt to change Labour's leadership rules to enable a left-wing successor to get on the ballot. Currently a candidate for the leadership requires the support of 15% of MPs and MEPs before the wider, left-wing membership gets a chance to vote for them.Mr Corbyn only succeeded in getting on to the ballot in 2015 because some of those to his right ""lent"" support to ""broaden the debate"" following the party's unexpectedly bad election result.That simply wouldn't happen again.So at this year's annual party conference in September it is almost certain delegates will be given the option to reduce that threshold from 15% to just 5% - a much smaller hurdle for a left-wing candidate to overcome.That would mean a leadership candidate would need the backing of just 13 elected politicians instead of 37 before being able to put themselves forward to the wider membership. This has been dubbed the ""McDonnell amendment"" by Mr Corbyn's critics.They say this rule change could see the party leadership ""transfer"" to the shadow chancellor, who failed to get on to the leadership ballot in 2007 when Tony Blair stood down, because he gained too few nominations from his fellow politicians.But he has denied any leadership ambitions and, in truth, it could be younger left-wing shadow cabinet members such as Rebecca Long-Bailey or Angela Rayner who would benefit from a lower threshold.Another potential beneficiary could be Clive Lewis, who resigned from the shadow cabinet over the leadership's backing for triggering Article 50 - breaking with those around Mr Corbyn in the process - but potentially endearing himself to the largely pro-Remain membership.He has denied already registering internet domain names for a leadership bid. But internal groups such as Labour First and Progress - put over-simply, Brownites and Blairites - are working closely together to try to prevent any of the above from succeeding.Their view is that if Mr Corbyn was simply replaced by someone with similar politics, Labour would have missed an opportunity to appeal to a wider electorate who believe the party is now too left-wing. So they are battling against the proposed leadership rule changes.The only way to stop the changes is to get more anti-Corbyn delegates to Labour's conference this autumn than those who support the leadership.That means getting more of the leadership's critics along to the local constituency meetings that choose the delegates.It's estimated that perhaps about 55% of last year's conference delegates were not Corbyn supporters and his critics believe they can succeed in delivering a similar, if not slightly better, number this year.Labour First recruited a full time organiser last month to assist in this project.With a large influx of left wing members following Labour's 2015 defeat, the assumption was that many local Labour parties would move to the left.But that has not been happening on quite the scale that was imagined, with some of the more recent members being happier to vote electronically in leadership elections for Mr Corbyn than attending what can often be tedious meetings to nominate conference delegates.And Mr Corbyn's opponents say that in recent internal elections - even in parts of London that would be assumed to be pro-Corbyn - those supportive of the leadership have been defeated.If this year's conference were to reject a change to the leadership rules, the issue can't be raised again for three years - in other words, until after the next election.That is likely to mean that Mr Corbyn would be urged by his inner circle to stay on until 2020 (assuming no early election) because a left-wing legacy couldn't be guaranteed.At the weekend Mr Corbyn made it clear that was indeed his intention to contest the next general election - but the working assumption by some others in leadership positions is that he would ideally want to stand aside in 2018 if a suitable successor were to emerge.To give him that option,  Momentum - the group set up to support him and to turn Labour into more of a social movement than a conventional political party - will have to work hard to defeat his opponents at the grassroots.This won't be as glamorous as the two summers of leadership rallies that have gone before, but might be far more important in determining the future direction of the main party of opposition."
2017-02-28,Northern Ireland election,https://web.archive.org//web/20170228234449/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-politics-39065379,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkOn Thursday, 2 March, Northern Ireland's voters go to the polls to elect a new government. Here's a guide to the political picture ahead of the imminent vote. That's right, Northern Ireland already did the election dance last May but we're going back to the ballot box just 10 months later.Stormont's power-sharing government collapsed in January.The collapse came about after Northern Ireland's deputy first minister, Sinn Féin's Martin McGuinness, resigned.In Northern Ireland, the government must be run by Irish nationalists and unionists together.The system was set up by the Good Friday Agreement following years of conflict. A first and deputy first minister, taken from the largest and second largest parties elected, are appointed to lead an executive of ministers.Although they have different titles, they essentially have equal authority and, in theory, work together in partnership.At the beginning of the year, the first minister was Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Arlene Foster who worked with Mr McGuinness as deputy first minister. But after he resigned, and Sinn Féin refused to nominate a replacement, Secretary of State James Brokenshire had no choice but to call for a new election.He stepped down after a row between Sinn Féin and the DUP over a green energy scheme scandal - the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI).You can read all about the scheme here. But, here's the short(-ish) version:Mrs Foster was in charge of the scheme when it was set up in 2012. It was designed to encourage businesses to switch from fossil fuels to environmentally friendly alternatives.But, subsidies were over-generous and initially there was no cap on payments - leading to what has been dubbed the ""cash-for-ash"" scandal. The scheme is projected to run £490m over budget, although a plan to eliminate the overspend was passed by the assembly just before it broke up in January. Sinn Féin asked that Mrs Foster temporarily stand aside while an investigation was carried out, but she refused.It's more complicated than that. While the scheme was the catalyst for Mr McGuinness resignation, he and Sinn Féin have said it was just one of many issues it had with the DUP, including Brexit (which the DUP backed, while Sinn Féin did not), same-sex marriage (to which the DUP is opposed, while Sinn Féin is in favour) and a potential Irish language act.These issues could become very important if the two parties retain their dominant positions as deal makers in March.Well, for one, Martin McGuinness is not back for re-election. A week after resigning, he announced he was quitting frontline politics because of ill health. Michelle O'Neill was appointed Sinn Féin's Northern leader in his stead and is leading the party into an election for the first time. Other than that, there's a major change in numbers, as less people are going to get elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly - only 90 MLAs (Members of the Legislative Assembly) as opposed to 108 last year.To reduce costs, Stormont decided in February 2016 it would cut the numbers. However, the law is being implemented a bit sooner than expected - it was thought the reduction would be introduced for the next scheduled election in 2021. Now, 18 MLAs will lose out less than a year after getting in the Stormont door. It remains to be seen, but the big two - DUP and Sinn Féin - are still the parties to beat. They led the power-sharing government after 2016's election and have been the big players at Stormont since 2007. The Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) and Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), the two other major unionist and nationalist parties, are aiming to usurp them. Last year, these two formed the first official opposition at the Northern Ireland Assembly.Meanwhile the Alliance Party, Northern Ireland's fifth largest with eight MLAs elected last year, is a centrist, non-sectarian group that straddles the line between unionist and nationalist. They are hoping to take advantage of any voter dissatisfaction at the DUP/Sinn Féin leadership and are also under new leadership, with former MP Naomi Long at the helm. They've been bubbling up in recent years. Jim Allister, leader of hard-line unionist party the TUV (Traditional Unionist Voice) has been a fixture at Stormont since 2011, which will be hoping to add to its solitary MLA.Likewise, the Green Party doubled its representation to two MLAs in 2016 and is optimistic of a strong showing. Also look out for anti-austerity outfit People Before Profit, who took their first two seats ever last year and are running even more candidates this time around. A form of proportional representation called Single Transferable Vote (STV) is used to elect candidates to the Northern Ireland Assembly. Voters rank candidates in order of preference.Candidates are then elected according to the share of the vote they receive. You can read an in-depth guide to the system here, or check out this video explainer. The two biggest unionist and nationalist parties will get together and try to form a new government.If it's the UUP and SDLP, then we should see a Stormont government under new leadership in reasonably short order.But, it's more likely that once again the DUP and Sinn Féin will be tasked with reaching agreement. And since they spectacularly fell out just a few weeks ago, that could be a challenge...That remains to be seen. But, Sinn Féin has repeatedly said there will be ""no return to the status quo"", so it appears they will not re-enter government with the DUP without agreement over thorny issues like the failed RHI scheme and the Irish language.It's apparent that some in-depth negotiations will be needed if both parties are elected. But the clock will be ticking - those tasked with forming a government have three weeks to agree and appoint an executive of ministers.If they can't find agreement on those issues then, technically, there could be another election.It's pretty unlikely. Instead, some other way of governing Northern Ireland will have to be found with direct rule from Westminster a real possibility. Nationalists have said that direct rule would be unacceptable, and called for the British and Irish governments to come together to form some kind of ""joint authority"" if the Northern Ireland Assembly cannot be re-established.However, unionists are against this idea while the Secretary of State James Brokenshire has said he is not considering any alternatives to a Northern Ireland Assembly. Whatever happens in Thursday's election, it's likely to be just the start of Northern Ireland's journey back to devolved government. "
2017-02-28,Words of warning,https://web.archive.org//web/20170228234449/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-39104962,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkIt takes one to know one. True, Sir John Major is not the only former Tory leader familiar with being pressured, perhaps held hostage by the Eurosceptics in his party. Or indeed, the only Conservative leader ever to have been challenged by his party's preponderance to ""bang on"" (to use David Cameron's phrase) about Europe. But arguably his experiences as the leader during bruising encounters with the ""bastards"" mean his words of warning might hold some value for the current prime minister. For Theresa May, also an unflashy leader who was propelled to No 10 by a surprising political moment, Europe will be defining in a way no others could even have anticipated.In Sir John's carefully calibrated speech tonight, there are plenty of messages for her, some of which may be welcome, some not. First off, having campaigned to stay in the European Union, with sober warnings particularly about the consequences for the Northern Irish peace process, it's no surprise that Sir John says that in his view, Brexit will be a ""historic mistake"".It is notable, although again not surprising, that he cautions that the UK will be a diminished diplomatic force in the world after we walk away from the EU, with a warning too that we will be less useful to our most important ally the US as a consequence.Also, even as the PM who lived through the Commons trauma of trying to deliver the Maastricht Treaty, it is logical that he calls for Parliament to have a full role in shaping the negotiations over our place in Europe. What may be harder for No 10 to dismiss is Sir John's obvious political concerns about how the public are being treated in the months after the referendum decision.Despite insisting he has no desire to be in politics now, he makes very pointed criticism of the atmosphere around the debate, warning that voters are essentially being misled saying: ""People have been led to expect a future that seems to be unreal and over-optimistic.""Obstacles are brushed aside as of no consequence, whilst opportunities are inflated beyond any reasonable expectation of delivery."" In his first public comments since the vote, the former prime minister is offering what he describes as a ""reality check"".And he sounds alarm bells too about the tone of the debate, saying Brexit's ""cheerleaders"" have shown ""contempt"" to Remainers, shouting down dissent ""against our traditions of tolerance"".While he is not seeking to be unhelpful to the government, Sir John plainly has doubts about Number 10's handling of the process so far - the ""rosy confidence"" being offered to the British people.And in the depths of his speech there is another warning for Theresa May about the Tory MPs she has worked so hard to keep on side - ""today they may be allies of the prime minister, the risk is that tomorrow they may not"".Might Theresa May face her own ""bastards"" one day? In recent weeks, with Theresa May determined to keep the Tory party together, and Labour struggling to stay united, the momentum has most certainly been with those celebrating our journey toward the exit door.Ministers, even those who were ardent Remainers, privately sound increasingly optimistic about the prospects of doing a deal. But Sir John Major is not alone in having fundamental concerns. And his voice is harder for the government to dismiss, as they did Tony Blair a couple of weeks ago. One senior figure even told me some of the talks behind closed doors have been a shambles, and raised concern that the government, all of us, are a long way from understanding the full implications of the decision. Yet with almost the only political pressure on her coming from the right, Theresa May has decided to emphasise the opportunity, not the risks. The government is well aware that things could go wrong, but one minister told me ""we all have to discover the reality together, when the rubber hits the road"". "

This will not affect the claims of current claimants. Last year, the government lost two cases in what is known as the Upper Tribunal - part of the courts system - about who should receive the Personal Independence Payment (PIP) and how much they should receive.The PIP is for people who face additional costs because of a disability or long-term illness. It has two elements: the daily living component and the mobility component.PIP assessments are based on a system of points, which are awarded to claimants according to the seriousness of their conditions.The number of points an applicant receives determines whether they are eligible for either element of PIP and, if so, whether at the standard or higher rate.The tribunal's rulings covered the two elements. The first found that some claimants who require assistance to take medication or monitor a health condition should receive more points than the assessments currently give. The second found that claimants who suffer overwhelming psychological distress when taking journeys should receive more points.The effect of the rulings would be to increase the number of eligible applicants and increase the number of people who qualify for the higher rates.The Department for Work and Pensions estimates that the total cumulative cost of complying with the tribunal's decisions would be £3.7bn over the next four years.         Disabilities minister Penny Mordaunt released a written statement on Thursday 23 February explaining that the government would seek to overturn the tribunal's decisions.That can be done using a statutory instrument that amends the Welfare Reform Act 2012. Labour opposes the reform and will seek to block the statutory instrument in the House of Lords and the House of Commons.If the government succeeds in getting the reform through, it will mean fewer people will receive PIPs in the future and fewer people will qualify for the higher rates. But it will not cut the awards of current claimants. Read more from Reality Check"

After electing Labour MPs for 80 years, voters changed their minds and elected a Conservative. What makes voters do this, and why is swing voting on the rise?Back in the 1960s, about 13% of voters would change which party they voted for, says Dr Jonathan Mellon from Nuffield College, Oxford. In 2015, that was closer to 40%. ""A really large proportion of voters are swingers - and this has been steadily increasing in each subsequent election,"" says Dr Mellon.There have always been some voters who changed their minds. The classic swing voter has no particular allegiance to any one party, and may choose a different party from one election to the next. Their decision can decide the outcome of an election, but this usually happens indirectly. ""Either you'll get swings from the major parties to minor parties - such as traditionally the Liberal Democrats but now also UKIP, the Greens, the SNP - or you'll see voters swing back to one of the major parties,"" Dr Mellon says.Joe Twyman, head of political and social research at the polling company YouGov, analysed swing voting at the most recent general election. ""One way of shifting that surprised a lot of people was the move from the Liberal Democrats to UKIP, and when people saw the data on that they would say, 'Well hang on, that doesn't make any sense, the ideology and the policies of Liberal Democrats are very different from those of UKIP. Why should people do that?' ""But it's about protest.""In the past few years, all the major parties have provided reasons for voters to turn against them. The Conservatives damaged their reputation with Black Wednesday, a day-long economic crisis in 1992. The Labour Party lost a million votes after the Iraq War, with many loyal members defecting to the Liberal Democrats or the Green Party.Liberal Democrat activist Tom Southern witnessed voters turn against his party, angry with it for joining a Conservative-led coalition government and raising university tuition fees. ""It was clear immediately that around half the support had been wiped out within months if not weeks,"" he says.And yet the coalition government was also beneficial to the smaller parties, including the Liberal Democrats. The public saw that a minor party had teamed up with a major party and was now in government. And this impression was reinforced during the 2015 general election campaign, when the leaders of seven different parties appeared on TV debates. The media proclaimed that any one of the smaller parties might hold the balance of power. This campaign proved to be a catalyst for voters. One in every 12 people in the UK voted for UKIP. One in two people in Scotland voted for the SNP.It is much rarer for voters to switch between Labour and the Conservatives. But the Copeland by-election is a reminder that this does happen. James Tilley, professor of politics at the University of Oxford, has studied one reason why voters might make this move.""In Britain it is definitely the case that older people are much more likely to vote for the Conservatives than younger people,"" he says. As voters get older, they are about 20% more likely to vote for the Conservative Party. But the reason for this is hard to identify. ""It could be that people born a long time ago are more likely to vote for the Conservatives,"" says Prof Tilley, ""or it could be that as we get older we become more likely to vote for the Conservatives."" He leans towards the second explanation.""People generally become a bit more resistant to change as they get older, and I think also that they tend to become less idealistic,"" says Prof Tilley.""So if parties on the right represent a platform which is more favourable to the status quo, and more about pragmatism than it is about idealism, that might be more attractive to older people than younger people.""Swing voting is a nightmare for the parties.In the past, MPs relied on their core vote to back them no matter what. Now, they have to spend far more of their time campaigning to keep their seats and far less time legislating. Politicians argue that democracy is less efficient when voters keep changing their minds.But Rosie Campbell, professor of Politics at Birkbeck, University of London, thinks that politics works best when voters are willing to change their minds. ""In the past, voters stuck with parties that had let them down, or had morphed into something they didn't like,"" she says.""Even if the future is more chaotic, the rise of the swinging mindset might just be the change our political system so desperately needs.""Analysis: How Voters Decide, presented by Prof Rosie Campbell, is on BBC Radio 4 at 20:30 on Monday 27 February and available later via BBC iPlayer."
2017-02-28,German Brits,https://web.archive.org//web/20170228234449/http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-39082468,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe Brexit debate in the UK is focusing on the rights of EU migrants in the country, among them about 300,000 Germans. Many people are worried about what will happen to them after Brexit. But how are the 100,000 Brits in Germany feeling? The BBC's Damien McGuinness says many are hurrying to apply for citizenship. ""So, when are you becoming German?"" It's one of those questions that always seems to crop up when I'm chatting to British friends here in Berlin these days. Most are either applying for German citizenship or counting the days until they've spent enough time here to be eligible. That's because no-one knows what will happen to them once Britain leaves the EU. These are not the bronzed ""expats"" of the tabloid imagination - living it up in the sun, glass of gin in one hand, golf club in the other. They are young freelancers worried that if they need visas their work will dry up. Or pensioners living in rented flats, surviving on fixed incomes tied to a shrinking pound. Esme was the most organised of any of us. She made her first appointment with the German authorities the week before the referendum. She took the citizenship test, submitted all the documents, and a few weeks ago became German in a ceremony in her local town hall, in the Berlin district of Neukoelln. What surprised her was how emotional she felt about it. About 50 people, of 22 different nationalities were being granted German citizenship: Syrians, Americans, Iraqis, Turks, Italians, French - even a few other Brits.The local mayor gave a speech welcoming everyone, and reflected on the meaning of Heimat, or homeland. And as she quoted from the German constitution, and talked about how all people were equal, regardless of gender, origin or ethnicity, Esme felt tears in her eyes. A cellist and a pianist played the 22 different national anthems of those present - by then, Esme was almost sobbing. And finally a singer came in to give a moving rendition of the European anthem, Beethoven's Ode to Joy - by which time Esme was in pieces. Not bad for an out-and-out liberal, who's usually pretty sceptical about flag-waving. ""It was the thought of the journeys that everyone had taken to get here,"" Esme explained to me afterwards. ""The wars that people had escaped from. And the efforts they had made to start a new life in Germany."" Some people had learned, off by heart, the declaration of allegiance to the German constitution, especially for the ceremony. Esme said it put her own worries into perspective.For Esme, and I suspect for a lot of the Brits who are now becoming German, what started out as a practical decision about visas and passports, is unexpectedly raising deeper questions about identity. Can you really be both German and British? And what does it mean to be German anyway? Not so very long ago, saying to other Brits that you're becoming German would almost inevitably lead to some tired gag about Nazis or towels on sun loungers. And although some British headlines might still use those cliches - and you can expect a few more if Brexit talks get nasty - today, modern Germany is seen more often as a bastion of tolerant values: international, democratic and open to immigrants.Of course, there are people outside and inside Germany who criticise Angela Merkel's decision to allow so many foreigners in. But for those new British-Germans, themselves migrants, a country that  welcomes foreigners is attractive. In fact, being a German with a hyphen is a relatively new concept here. Traditionally German identity was an ethnic idea, related to bloodline rather than where you were born. So it used to feel as if Britain and America were rather better at accepting that people had layered identities - enabling you to be originally from one country, but a citizen of another. But over the past few decades Germany has been going through a difficult, and largely successful, process of redefining what it means to be German. Angela Merkel now refers to Germany as ""a country of immigration"" - an unimaginable statement for a centre-right chancellor until very recently. And today 20% of Germans are described as having a migrant background. Brexit-Britain and Trump's US, meanwhile, seem to be heading in the opposite direction. At least, that's what it looks like from here.  As for me, my own citizenship status is a bureaucratic muddle. It's no doubt my own fault for moving around too much, but growing up in a globalising world I had thought passports, borders and notions of citizenship were losing their importance. Today though, as I scrabble together previously unheard of documents to avoid suddenly becoming an illegal alien, I can see I was wrong.Join the conversation - find us on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter."

2017-02-28,Meet the EU's chief Brexit negotiator,https://web.archive.org//web/20170228234449/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37542204,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThe British papers love a French villain at the heart of the EU.Is Michel Barnier about to succeed Jacques Delors as the object of their affection? The veteran Gaullist already has form.When he was Commissioner for the Internal Market and Financial Services, Mr Barnier was dubbed ""the most dangerous man in Europe"" after taking on the banking sector and championing a cap on bankers' bonuses. But while he alarmed some in the City, and will probably do so again, he also won grudging respect as a tough but even-handed negotiator.He will need all those skills and more in his new role - chief Brexit negotiator at the European Commission. And having moved seamlessly between big jobs in Paris and Brussels - French foreign minister, Commissioner, MEP - he looks well prepared. ""Don't ask me to tell you what will be at the end of the road, we haven't begun to walk yet,"" he told a conference in Brussels last month. Mr Barnier will stick closely to the official EU position of ""no negotiation without notification"" - waiting for the UK to trigger Article 50 to start the formal process of withdrawal. But he's clearly eager to get going.""I am waiting to begin,"" he said. ""I will be ready tomorrow to negotiate, frankly speaking.""And he will bring with him an instinctive pro-European agenda, and a deep knowledge of the workings of the single market.His deputy as chief Brexit negotiator is a German trade expert, Sabine Weyand, adding to the impression that Mr Barnier will lead a team that means business.One of the biggest challenges he (and his boss Jean-Claude Juncker) faces, is to ensure that representatives of the big member states don't sideline him in the Brexit divorce negotiations.But Mr Barnier's long career in French politics means he could well have the ear of the Elysee Palace, especially if - as looks likely - a centre-right candidate wins the French presidency next year. The stakes are so high that there are bound to be some clashes.Mr Barnier has sparred with the UK's Minister for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, before, when the men both served as Europe ministers in the 1990s. It is another reminder that Michel Barnier is a politician first and foremost, rather than a bureaucrat. There have certainly been criticisms - a dash of vanity, a lack of attention to detail. His career has had plenty of downs as well as ups.But he will defend his European vision to the end, and the British government would do well not to underestimate him.At the height of the eurozone crisis, Mr Barnier always refused (politely) to do broadcast interviews in English.""One wrong word,"" he told me once with a smile, ""and we could move markets.""The next few years will be equally challenging."
2017-02-28,'Indyref 2' being pushed online,https://web.archive.org//web/20170228234449/http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-36615645,"As the EU referendum count turned decisively towards Leave, the online conversation in Scotland immediately turned to the possibility of another vote on independence.The idea has been long been dubbed ""indyref 2"" and that hashtag shot to the top of Twitter's trends list shortly after the vote result became clear. Scotland voted 62% in favour of Remain.The conversation online was being driven overwhelmingly by pro-independence campaigners. But people who had supported ""Better Together"" during the Scottish referendum vote also spoke about the possibility of a break-away from the UK as a result of the vote over EU membership.  Perhaps the most significant was Scottish author JK Rowling who tweeted: ""Scotland will seek independence now. Cameron's legacy will be breaking up two unions. Neither needed to happen.""Many took to Twitter to express new or strengthened pro-independence feelings in the wake of the latest vote (Just as a reminder: a ""Yes"" vote in Scotland's 2014 referendum was for independence, while the winning ""No"" campaign backed staying in the UK).One old tweet from 2014's independence referendum gained new life on Friday. Put out by the cross-party Better Together campaign, it reminded Scottish voters that the EU membership of an independent Scotland would be no sure thing:Blog by Mike WendlingNext story: Nigel Farage's wild nightAs the EU referendum vote swung decisively to Leave, perhaps nobody's fortunes changed more than UKIP leader Nigel Farage. And the change is clearly visible on his Twitter timeline.READ MORE You can follow BBC Trending on Twitter @BBCtrending, and find us on Facebook.  All our stories are at bbc.com/trending."
